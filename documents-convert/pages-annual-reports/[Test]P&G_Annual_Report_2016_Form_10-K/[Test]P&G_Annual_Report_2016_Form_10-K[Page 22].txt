SEGMENT RESULTS
Segment results reﬂect information on the same basis we use for internal management reporting and performance evaluation. The results of these
reportable segments do not include certain non-business unit specific costs such as interest expense, investing activities and certain restructuring
and asset impairment costs. These costs are reported in our Corporate segment and are included as part of our Corporate segment discussion.
Additionally, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we apply blended statutory tax rates in the segments. Eliminations to
adjust segment results to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. All references to net earnings throughout the discussion of
segment results refer to net earnings from continuing operations.
