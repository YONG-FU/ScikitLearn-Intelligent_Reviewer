if (A) the Shareholder Nominee(s) and/or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have breached its or their obligations,
agreements or representations under this Section 9, as determined by the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the
annual shareholder meeting, or (B) the Eligible Shareholder (or a qualified representative thereof) does not appear at the
annual shareholder meeting to present any nomination pursuant to this Section 9. For purposes of this Section 9, to be
considered a qualified representative of the Eligible Shareholder, a person must be authorized by a writing executed by such
Eligible Shareholder, or an electronic transmission delivered by such Eligible Shareholder, to act for such Eligible Shareholder
as proxy at the annual shareholder meeting and such person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a
reliable reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the annual shareholder meeting.
(d) Ownership Requirements.
(i) An Eligible Shareholder must have owned (as defined above) 3% or more of the Company’s outstanding capital stock
continuously for at least three (3) years (the “Required Shares”) as of both (A) a date within seven (7) days prior to the date
of the Nomination Notice and (B) the record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the annual shareholder
meeting. The Eligible Shareholder must continue to own the Required Shares through the annual shareholder meeting date.
For purposes of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement under this Section 9, (I) the shares of the capital stock of the
Company owned by one or more shareholders, or by the person or persons who own shares of the capital stock of the
Company and on whose behalf any shareholder is acting, may be aggregated, provided that the number of shareholders and
other persons whose ownership of shares is aggregated for such purpose shall not exceed twenty (20), and (II) a group of
funds under common management and investment control shall be treated as one shareholder or person for this purpose. No
person may be a member of more than one group of persons constituting an Eligible Shareholder under this Section 9.
(ii) For purposes of this Section 9, an Eligible Shareholder shall be deemed to “own” only those outstanding shares as to which
the shareholder possesses both (A) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (B) the full economic
interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares
calculated in accordance with clauses (A) and (B) shall not include any shares (I) sold by such shareholder or any of its
affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, including any short sale, (II) borrowed by such shareholder
or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such shareholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to
resell, or (III) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, or other derivative or similar agreement
entered into by such shareholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with
shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or
is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (a) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such
shareholder’s or its affiliates’ full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (b) hedging, offsetting or
altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such shareholder or affiliate.
A shareholder shall “own” shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the shareholder retains the right to instruct
how the shares are voted with reSpect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A person’s ownership of
shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which (A) the person has loaned such shares, provided that the person has the power to
recall such loaned shares on three (3) business days’ notice; or (B) the person has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of
attorney or other instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the person. The terms “owned,” “owning” and other variations of the
word “own” shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Company are “owned” for these purposes
shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and its shareholders.
(e) Agreements of the Eligible Shareholder. An Eligible Shareholder shall:
(i) Within the time period specified in this Section 9 for providing the Nomination Notice, provide the following information in
writing to the Secretary of the Company:
(A) one or more written statements from the record holder of the shares (and from each intermediary through which the
shares are or have been held during the requisite three-year holding period) verifying that, as of a date within seven
(7) days prior to the date of the Nomination Notice, the Eligible Shareholder owns, and has owned continuously for
the preceding three (3) years, the Required Shares, and the Eligible Shareholder’s agreement to provide, within five
(5) business
