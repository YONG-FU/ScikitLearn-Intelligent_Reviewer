All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in
Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The total notional amount of contracts outstanding at the end of the period is indicative
of the level of the Company's derivative activity during the period. The decrease in the notional balance of interest rate fair value hedges is due to
the maturity of fixed rate debt and underlying swaps in the current period. The increase in the notional balance of net investment hedges primarily
reﬂects a movement into Euro cross currency swaps due to lower interest rates in the current period. All of the Company's derivative assets and
liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between
levels during the periods presented. In addition, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods
presented. Except for the impairment charges related to our Batteries business (see Note 4), there were no significant assets or liabilities that were
re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
