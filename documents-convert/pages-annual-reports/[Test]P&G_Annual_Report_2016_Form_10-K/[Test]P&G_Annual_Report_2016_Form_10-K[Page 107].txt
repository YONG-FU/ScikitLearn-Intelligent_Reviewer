(B)(1) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or
junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series A Preferred Stock for all Dividend Payment Dates
occurring on or prior to the date of payment of such full dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and any other shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on Series A Preferred Stock and such other
parity shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
such other parity shares bear to each other. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not
be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on Series A
Preferred Stock.
(2) So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares
of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock as
to dividends and other than as provided in paragraph (B)(1) of this Section 2) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution
declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other shares ranking junior to or on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends,
nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends be
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption
of any such shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of the Company ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock
as to dividends) unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid.
(3) Any dividend payment made on shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid
dividend due with respect to shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
3. Liquidation Preference.
(A) In the event of any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution
of the assets of the Company (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any series or class or classes of stock of
the Company ranking junior to Series A Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive the Liquidation Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of dissolution or liquidation plus an amount equal to all dividends
accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to
any further payments. The Liquidation Price per share which holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall receive upon dissolution or liquidation shall
be $110004, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. If, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the assets of the Company, or
proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential amount aforesaid
and liquidating payments on any other shares ranking as to dissolution or liquidation, on a parity with Series A Preferred Stock, then such assets,
or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any such other shares ratably in accordance with
the respective amounts which would be payable on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and any such other shares if all amounts payable
thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 3, a consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more corporations shall not be
deemed to be a dissolution or liquidation, voluntary or involuntary.
(B) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to Series A
Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, after payment shall have been made in full to
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking
junior to Series A Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be
entitled to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share
therein.
4. Ranking of Shares.
Any shares of the Company shall be deemed to rank:
(A) prior to Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if the holders of such
class shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or
priority to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock;
