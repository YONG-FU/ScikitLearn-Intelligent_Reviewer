The underfunding of pension benefits is primarily a function of the different funding incentives that exist outside of the US. In certain countries,
there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations prior to their due date. In these
instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due.
