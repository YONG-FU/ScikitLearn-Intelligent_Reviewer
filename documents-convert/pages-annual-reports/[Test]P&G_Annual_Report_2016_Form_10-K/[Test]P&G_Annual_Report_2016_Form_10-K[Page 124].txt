of the Company, or, if no such investment banking or appraisal firm is in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company available
to make such determination, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.
(3) "Pro Rata Repurchase" shall mean any purchase of shares of Common Stock by the Company or any subsidiary thereof, whether for
cash, shares of capital stock of the Company, other securities of the Company, evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or
any other property (including shares of a subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof, effected while any of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock are outstanding, pursuant to any tender offer or exchange offer subject to Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), or any successor provision of law, or pursuant to any other offer available to substantially all holders of Common
Stock; provided, however, that no purchase of shares by the Company or any subsidiary thereof made in open market transactions shall be deemed
a Pro Rata Repurchase. For purposes of this paragraph 9(F), shares shall be deemed to have been purchased by the Company or any subsidiary
thereof "in Open market transactions" if they have been purchased substantially in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 as in effect
under the Exchange Act on the date shares of Series B Preferred Stock are initially issued by the Company or on such other terms and conditions as
the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined are reasonably designed to prevent such purchases from having a material effect on
the trading market for the Common Stock.
(G) Whenever an adjustment increasing the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding is required pursuant to this
Appendix B, the Board of Directors shall take such action as is necessary so that a sufficient number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock are
designated with respect to such increase resulting from such adjustment. Whenever an adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B
Liquidation Price or the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of the Series B Preferred Stock is required pursuant to this Appendix B, the Company shall
forthwith place on file with the transfer agent for the Common Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock if there be one, and with the Treasurer of the
Company, a statement signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer of the Company stating the adjusted Series B Conversion Price, Series B
Liquidation Price and Series B Preferred Dividend Rate determined as provided herein. Such statement shall set forth in reasonable detail such facts
as shall be necessary to show the reason and the manner of computing such adjustment, including any determination of Fair Market Value involved
in such computation. Promptly after each adjustment to the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Series B Conversion
Price, the Series B Liquidation Price or the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate, the Company shall mail a notice thereof and of the then prevailing
number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding, the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred
Dividend Rate to each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
10. Miscellaneous.
(A) All notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of
receipt thereof or three (3) business days after the mailing thereof if sent by registered mail (unless firstâ€”class mail shall be specifically permitted for
such notice under the terms of this Appendix B) with postage prepaid, addressed: (i) if to the Company, to its office at One Procter & Gamble Plaza,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 (Attention: Treasurer) or to the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, or other agent of the Company designated as
permitted by this Appendix B or (ii) if to any holder of the Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be, to such holder at the
address of such holder as listed in the stock record books of the Company (which may include the records of any transfer agent for the Series B
Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be) or (iii) to such other address as the Company or any such holder, as the case may be, shall
have designated by notice similarly given.
(B) The term "Common Stock" as used in this Appendix B means the Company's Common Stock without par value, as the same exists at
the date of filing of the Amendment to the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation first designating Series B Preferred Stock, or any other
class of stock resulting from successive changes or reclassifications of such Common Stock consisting solely of changes in par value, or from par
value to without par value, or from without par value to par value. In the event that, at any time as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to
Section 9 of this Appendix B, the holder of any share of the Series B Preferred Stock upon thereafter surrendering such shares for conversion shall
become entitled to receive any shares or other securities of the Company other than shares of Common Stock, the anti-dilution provisions
contained in Section 9 hereof shall apply in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common
Stock, and the provisions of Sections 1 through 8 and 10 of this Appendix B with respect to the Common Stock shall apply on like or similar terms to
any such other shares or securities.
(C) The Company shall pay any and all stock transfer and documentary stamp taxes that may be payable in reSpect of any issuance or
delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or shares of Common Stock or other securities issued on account of Series B Preferred Stock pursuant
hereto or certificates representing such shares or securities. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any such tax which may be
payable in respect of any transfer of the Series B Preferred or Common Stock or other Securities by the holder thereof to a subsequent holder
resulting in the issuance or delivery of shares of Series B Preferred Stock or Common Stock or other securities in a name other than that in which the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock with respect
