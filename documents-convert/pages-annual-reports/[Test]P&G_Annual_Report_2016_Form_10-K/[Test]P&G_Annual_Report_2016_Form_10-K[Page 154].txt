or, in the case of Participants who have job responsibilities outside of the United States, the appropriate foreign country or
countries' industry.
(f) By acceptance of any Award granted under the terms of the Plan, the Participant acknowledges that if the Participant were,
without authority, to use or disclose the Company’s or any of its affiliates’ or Subsidiaries’ confidential and proprietary trade
secret information or threaten to do so or violate or threaten to violate any other covenant of this Article 6, the Company or one
of its affiliates or Subsidiaries would be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate relief to prevent the Participant from doing so.
The Participant acknowledges that the harm caused to the Company by the breach or anticipated breach of this Article 6 is by its
nature irreparable because, among other things, it is not readily susceptible of proof as to the monetary harm that would ensue.
The Participant consents that any interim or final equitable relief entered by a court of competent jurisdiction shall, at the request
of the Company or one of its affiliates or Subsidiaries, be entered on consent and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over
the Participant, without prejudice to any rights either party may have to appeal from the proceedings which resulted in any grant
of such relief.
(g) Notwithstanding the requirements of confidentiality contained in this Article 6, the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016
immunizes Participant against criminal and civil liability under federal or state trade secret laws for Participant’s disclosure of trade
secrets that is made i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney
solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a
lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal; or iii) to Participant’s attorney for use in a lawsuit alleging retaliation
for reporting a suspected violation of law, provided that any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and
Participant does not otherwise disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
(h) If any of the provisions contained in this Article 6 shall for any reason, whether by application of existing law or law which
may develop after the Participant’s acceptance of an Award under the Plan be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be overly broad as to scope of activity, duration, or territory, the Participant agrees to join the Company or any of its affiliates or
Subsidiaries in requesting such court to construe such provision by limiting or reducing it so as to be enforceable to the extent
compatible with then applicable law. If any one or more of the terms, provisions, covenants, or restrictions of this Article 6 shall
be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, then the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants, and restrictions of this Article 6 shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
impaired, or invalidated.
6.2 Remedies. The Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid or deferred
Awards at any time if the Participant is not in compliance with all terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, including this Article 6. By acceptance
of any Award granted under the terms of the Plan, the Participant acknowledges that the remedies outlined in this Section 6.2 and in Section 6.3
below are in addition to any remedy the Company or any affiliate or Subsidiary may have at law or in equity, including without limitation injunctive
and other appropriate relief.
6.3 Repayment Obligations. Upon exercise, payment or delivery of an Award, the Participant shall certify in a manner acceptable to the
Company that he or she has complied with the terms and conditions of the Plan. In the event a Participant fails to comply with any provision in this
Article 6 at any time before or after exercise, payment or delivery of an Award, the Participant shall repay to the Company the net proceeds of any
exercises, payments or deliveries of Awards which occur at any time after the earlier of the following two dates: (a) the date three years immediately
preceding any such violation; or (b) the date 6 months prior to the Participant’s Termination of Employment. The Participant shall repay to the
Company the net proceeds in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required by the Company, and the Company shall be
entitled to set—off against the amount of any such net proceeds any amount owed to the Participant by the Company, to the extent that such set-off
is not inconsistent with Code Section 409A. For purposes of this paragraph, “net proceeds” shall mean (1) for each Option or SAR exercise, the
difference between the Option Price and the greater of (i) the price of Shares on the date of exercise or (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition
of the underlying Shares, less any applicable taxes withheld by the Company; (2) for RSUs or Performance Stock Units, the greater of (i) the number
of net Shares delivered to the Participant multiplied by the closing price of Shares on the date of delivery or (ii) the amount realized upon the
disposition of the number of net Shares delivered, in either case less any applicable taxes withheld by the Company; (3) for Restricted Stock, the
greater of (i) the number of net Shares retained by, or delivered to, the Participant after any restrictions lapse multiplied by the closing price of
Shares on the date the restrictions lapse or (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of the number of net Shares delivered, in either case less
any applicable taxes withheld by the Company; and (4) for all other Awards, the value of Shares or cash delivered to the Participant less any
applicable taxes withheld by the Company.
