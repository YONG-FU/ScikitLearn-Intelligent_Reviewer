Amounts expected to be amortized from AOCI into net periodic benefit cost during the year ending June 30, 2017, are as follows:
Pension Benefits _ Other Retiree Benefits
lNet actuarial loss $ 400 $ 126 1

Assumptions. We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. These assumptions are weighted to reﬂect each country that may have
an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. The weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, were as follows: (1)
Pension Benefits Other Retiree Benefits
2016 _ 2015 _ 2016 _ 2015
lDiscount rate 2.1% 3.1% 3.6% 4.5%
Rate of compensation increase 2.9% 3.1% N/A N/A
Health care cost trend rates assumed for next year N/A N/A 7.2% 6.8%
Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) N/A N/A 4.9% 5.0%
lYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate N/A N/A 2021 2021 l
(I) Determined as of end of year.

Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement
plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from
pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 5 - 6% for bonds. For other retiree
benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reﬂects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on
Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reﬂects the historical pattern of returns.
Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other retiree benefit plans. A one percentage
point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
One-Percentage One-Percentage
Point Increase _ Point Decrease
Effect on the total service and interest cost components $ 80 $ (59) 1
Effect on the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 1,057 (809)
Plan Assets. Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations, while minimizing the
potential for future required Company plan contributions. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit
payments and an apprOpriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by matching the
actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account
investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally
invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets
rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers’ performance relative to the investment
guidelines established with each investment manager.
