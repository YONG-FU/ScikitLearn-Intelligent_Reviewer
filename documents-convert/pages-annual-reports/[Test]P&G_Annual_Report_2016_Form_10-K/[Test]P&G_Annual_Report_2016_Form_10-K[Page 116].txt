(hereinafter referred to as Series B Preferred Stock)
1. Cancellation.
All shares of Series B Preferred Stock redeemed or purchased by the Company shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Preferred Stock.
2. Dividends and Distributions.
(A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends ("Series B Preferred Dividends") in
an amount per share initially equal to $4.12 5 per share per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided, (such amount, as
adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Series B Preferred Dividend Rate"), payable quarterly, one-fourth on the twenty-
seventh day of November, one-fourth on the twenty—seventh day of February, one-fourth on the twenty-seventh day of May, and one-fourth on
the twenty—seventh day of August of each year (each a "Series B Dividend Payment Date") commencing on August 27, 1993, to holders of record at
the close of business on the second Friday of the relevant Series B Dividend Payment Date month, provided that if the Board of Directors has
declared since the prior Dividend Payment Date a quarterly dividend on the Common Stock at a rate that exceeds one-fourth of the Preferred
Dividend Rate in effect on such day, the holders of record on the start of business on the record date for such dividend on the Common Stock shall
be entitled to receive a cash dividend in an amount per share equal to the quarterly dividend declared on a share of Common Stock, payable on the
same date as such dividend on the Common Stock, and provided further that the Dividend Payment Date for the Series B Preferred Stock shall
thereafter be the same date as the record date for the dividend on the Common Stock or if no dividend is declared on the Common Stock in any
quarter, the Dividend Payment Date shall be, as appropriate, the fifteenth day of February, May, August or November or if such days are not a day
on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, then the next preceding day when the New York Stock Exchange is open for business.
Series B Preferred Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the date of issuance of such shares of
Series B Preferred Stock. Series B Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis, based on the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such
day, whether or not the Company shall have earnings or surplus at the time, but Series B Preferred Dividends accrued after June 30, 1993 on the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly period between Series B Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months. A partial dividend payment of $64935 5 per share shall accrue for the period from the date of issuance
until August 27, 1993. Accumulated but unpaid
Series B Preferred Dividends shall cumulate as of the Series B Dividend Payment Date on which they first become payable, but no interest shall
accrue on accumulated but unpaid Series B Preferred Dividends.
(B)(1) No full dividends shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment on any shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with or
junior to the Series B Preferred Stock, for any period unless full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof set apart for such payment on the Series B Preferred Stock for all Series B Dividend Payment
Dates occurring on or prior to the date of payment of such full dividends. When dividends are not paid in full, as aforesaid, upon the shares of
Series B Preferred Stock and any other shares ranking, as to dividends, on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon shares
of Series B Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that the amount of dividends declared per share on Series B Preferred Stock and such other
parity shares shall in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that accumulated dividends per share on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and
such other parity shares bear to each other. Except as otherwise provided in these Articles, holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not
be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, property or shares, in excess of full cumulative dividends, as herein provided, on Series B
Preferred Stock.
5 As a result of two two—for-one stock splits on the Common Stock effective August 22, 1997 and May 21, 2004 and the Smucker transaction effective June 1,
2002, the Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate were all adjusted in accordance with the terms of paragraph 9(A)(1) of this Appendix
B to be as follows: Conversion Price -- $12.96; Liquidation Price -- $12.96; Preferred Dividend Rate -— $1.022 per share per annum, with a corresponding change
in the quarterly dividend payment. (This footnote is not a part of the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation but is included to provide up—to-date
