(c) ShareholderNominees.
(i) The number of Shareholder Nominees appearing in the Company’s proxy materials with respect to an annual shareholder
meeting shall not exceed the greater of (A) two (2) or (B) twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors in office as of the
last day on which a Nomination Notice may be delivered pursuant to this Section 9, or if such amount is not a whole number,
the closest whole number below twenty percent (20%); provided, however, that this maximum number shall be reduced, but
not below zero (0), by the number of (I) Shareholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Shareholder for inclusion in
the Company’s proxy materials pursuant to this Section 9 but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of
Directors decides to nominate as Board nominees, and (II) director candidates for which the Company shall have received
one or more valid shareholder notices (whether or not subsequently withdrawn) nominating director candidates pursuant to
Section 8. In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the last day on which
a Nomination Notice can be delivered pursuant to this Section 9 but before the date of the annual shareholder meeting and
the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the Board of Directors in connection therewith, the maximum number of
Shareholder Nominees included in the Company’s proxy materials shall be calculated based on the number of directors as so
reduced.
(ii) In the event that the number of Shareholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Shareholders pursuant to this Section 9 exceeds
this maximum number, each Eligible Shareholder will select one Shareholder Nominee for inclusion in the Company’s proxy
materials until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the capital stock
of the Company each Eligible Shareholder disclosed as owned in its respective Nomination Notice submitted to the
Company. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Shareholder has selected one Shareholder Nominee, this
selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the maximum number is
reached.
(iii) Following the determination of which Shareholder Nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials, if any
Shareholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements herein is thereafter: nominated by the Board of Directors; is
otherwise not included in the Company’s proxy materials; or is not submitted for director election for any reason (including
the Eligible Shareholder’s or Shareholder Nominee’s failure to comply with the requirements herein), no other nominee or
nominees shall be included in the Company’s proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution
thereof.
(iv) The Company shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 9, any Shareholder Nominee in its proxy materials for
any meeting of shareholders (A) if the Eligible Shareholder who has nominated such Shareholder Nominee has engaged in or
is currently engaged in, or has been or is a “participant” in another person’s, “solicitation” within the meaning of Rule 14a—1
(1) under the 1934 Act in support of the election of any individual as a director at the meeting other than its Shareholder
Nominee(s) or a nominee of the Board of Directors, (B) who is not independent under the Applicable Independence
Standards (as defined below), as determined by the Board of Directors, (C) who serves as an executive officer of a company
where a P&G employee director serves on the Board of Directors, (D) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors
would cause the Company to be in violation of these Regulations, the Articles of Incorporation, the listing standards of the
principal exchange upon which the Company’s capital stock is traded, or any applicable law, rule or regulation, (E) who is or
has been, within the past three years, an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust
Act of 1914, (F) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding minor traffic violations and other minor
offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten (10) years, (G) who is subject to any order
of the type specified in Rule 506(d) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (H) if such
Shareholder Nominee or the applicable Eligible Shareholder shall have provided information to the Company in respect to
such nomination that was untrue in any material respect or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not misleading, as determined by the Board of
Directors, or (I) if the Eligible Shareholder or applicable Shareholder Nominee otherwise contravenes any of the agreements
or representations made by such Eligible Shareholder or Shareholder Nominee or fails to comply with its obligations pursuant
to this Section 9.
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Board of Directors or the person presiding at the meeting shall
declare a nomination by an Eligible Shareholder to be invalid, and such nomination shall be disregarded notwithstanding that
proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Company,
