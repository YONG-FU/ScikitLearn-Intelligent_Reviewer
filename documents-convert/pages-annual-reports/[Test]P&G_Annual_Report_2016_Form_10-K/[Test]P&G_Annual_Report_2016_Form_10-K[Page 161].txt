the Termination of Employment not occurred. For purposes of this Section 17.1, a Termination of Employment for Good Reason shall not be
considered to be for Good Reason unless:
(a) the Participant has provided the Company with a written notice of his or her intent to terminate employment for Good Reason
within sixty (60) days of the Participant becoming aware of the circumstances giving rise to Good Reason; and
(b) the Participant allows the Company thirty (30) days to remedy such circumstances to the extent curable.
17.2 Assumed Awards Deﬁned. For purposes of this Article 17, an Award shall be considered assumed (“Assumed”) if each of the
following conditions are met:
(a) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights are converted into a replacement Award in a manner that complies with Code Section
409A;
(b) RSUs and Restricted Stock Awards are converted into a replacement Award covering a number of shares of the entity
effecting the Change in Control (or a successor or parent corporation), as determined in a manner substantially similar to the
treatment of an equal number of Shares covered by the Award; provided that to the extent that any portion of the consideration
received by holders of Shares in the Change in Control transaction is not in the form of the common stock of such entity (or a
successor or parent corporation), the number of shares covered by the replacement Award shall be based on the average of the
high and low selling prices of the common stock of such entity (or a successor or parent corporation) on the established stock
exchange on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the Change in Control;
(c) the replacement Award contains provisions for scheduled vesting and treatment on Termination of Employment (including
the definition of Cause and Good Reason) that are no less favorable to the Participant than the underlying Award being replaced,
and all other terms of the replacement Award (other than the security and number of shares represented by the replacement
Award) are substantially similar to the underlying Award; and
(d) the security represented by the replacement Award is of a class that is publicly held and widely traded on an established
stock exchange; and
(e) vesting does not depend upon the satisfaction of one or more performance conditions.
17.3 Awards not Assumed by Successor
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, Awards under the Plan which are not Assumed by the person(s) or entity(s)
effecting the Change in Control shall become fully vested and exercisable on the date of the Change in Control, any restrictions
that apply to such Awards shall lapse, and any performance-based Award shall be deemed to be satisfied at the target level.
Payment with respect to such Awards shall be made as follows:
(i) For each Option and Stock Appreciation Right, the Participant shall receive a payment equal to the difference
between the consideration (consisting of cash or other property (including securities of a successor or parent
corporation)) received by holders of Shares in the Change in Control transaction and the exercise price of the applicable
Option or Stock Appreciation Right, if such difference is positive. Such payment shall be made in the same form as the
consideration received by holders of Shares. Any Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is
higher than the per share consideration received by holders of Shares in connection with the Change in Control shall be
cancelled for no additional consideration.
(ii) For each Share of Restricted Stock, RSU, or Performance Stock Unit, the Participant shall receive the consideration
(consisting of cash or other prOperty (including securities of a successor or parent corporation)) which such Participant
would have received in the Change in Control transaction had he or she been, immediately prior to such transaction, a
holder of the number of Shares equal to the number of Shares covered by the Restricted Stock, RSUs, or Performance
Stock Units (based on target level performance)
