7. Redemption to Satisfy Obligations of The Procter & Gamble ProÔ¨Åt Sharing Trust and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
Unless otherwise provided by law, shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the Company for cash or, if the Company so

provided by paragraph (D) of Section 6, at the Series B Liquidation Price per share in effect on the date fixed for redemption plus all accrued

8. Consolidation, Merger, etc.
(A) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to
which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged solely for or changed, reclassified or converted solely into
shares of any successor or resulting company (including the Company) that constitutes "qualifying employer securities" with respect to a holder of
Series B Preferred Stock within the meanings of Section 4975(e)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Section 407(d)(5) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or any successor provision of law, and, if applicable, for a cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares, if any, then, in such event, the terms of such consolidation or merger or similar transaction shall provide that the shares of Series
B Preferred Stock of such holder shall be substituted for and shall become preferred shares of such successor or resulting company, having in
reSpect of such company insofar as possible the same powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights (including the
redemption rights provided by Sections 6, 7, and 8 hereof), and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon, that the Series B Preferred
Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; provided, however, that after such transaction each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be
convertible, pursuant to the terms and conditions provided by Section 5 hereof, into the qualifying employer securities so receivable by a holder of
the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such
transaction (provided that, if the kind or amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction is not the same for each non-
electing share, then the kind and amount of qualifying employer securities receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the
kind and amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing shares). The rights of the Series B Preferred Stock as preferred shares of
such successor or resulting company shall successively be subject to adjustments pursuant to Section 9 hereof after any such transaction as nearly
equivalent to the adjustments provided for by such section prior to such transaction. The Company shall not consummate any such merger,
consolidation or similar transaction unless all the terms of this paragraph 8(A) are complied with.
(B) In the event that the Company shall consummate any consolidation or merger or similar transaction, however named, pursuant to
which the outstanding shares of Common Stock are by operation of law exchanged for or changed, reclassified or converted into other shares or
securities or cash or any other property, or any combination thereof, other than any such consideration which is constituted solely of qualifying
employer securities (as referred to in paragraph (A) of this Section 8) and cash payments, if applicable, in lieu of fractional shares, outstanding
shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall, without any action on the part of the Company or any holder thereof (but subject to paragraph (C) of this
Section 8, be deemed converted by virtue of such merger, consolidation or similar transaction immediately prior to such consummation into the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted at such time and each share of
Series B Preferred Stock shall, by virtue of such transaction and on the same terms as apply to the holders of Common Stock, be converted into or
exchanged for the aggregate amount of shares, securities, cash or other property (payable in like kind) receivable by a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series B Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such transaction if
such holder of Common Stock failed to exercise any rights of election as to the kind or amount of shares, securities, cash or other property
