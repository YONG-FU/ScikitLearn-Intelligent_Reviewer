48 The Procter & Gamble Company
NOTE 6
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) are divided by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the year to calculate Basic net earnings per common share. Diluted net earnings per common share are
calculated to give effect to stock options and other stock—based awards (see Note 7) and assume conversion of preferred stock (see Note 8).
Net earnings/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble and common shares used to calculate Basic and Diluted net earnings per share were as follows:

(1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold.
Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP’s obligations through 2035.
(2) Outstanding stock options of approximately 55 million in 2016, 8 million in 2015 and 9 million in 2014 were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share
calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the
market value of the underlying common shares).
(3) Basic net earnings per common share and Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated on Net earnings/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble.
