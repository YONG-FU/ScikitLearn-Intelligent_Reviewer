(I) As of June 30, 2016, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet reﬂects a liability for uncertain tax positions of $1.2 billion, including $343 million of interest
and penalties. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outﬂows of liabilities for uncertain tax positions beyond one year, a
reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve months from the balance sheet date of June 30, 2016, cannot be made.
(2) Operating lease obligations are shown net of guaranteed sublease income.
(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its
future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash ﬂows
are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2019 are not currently determinable.
(4) Primarily reﬂects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments
made under take-or-pay obligations represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing. This includes service contracts for
information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent
contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity.
In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other
contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that
are part of normal operations and are reﬂected in historical operating cash ﬂow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our
liquidity position.
