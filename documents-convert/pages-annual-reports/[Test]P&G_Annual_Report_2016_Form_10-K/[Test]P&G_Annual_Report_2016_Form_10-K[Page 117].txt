(2) So long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, no dividend (other than dividends or distributions paid in shares
of, or options, warrants or rights to subscribe for or purchase shares of, Common Stock or other shares ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock as
to dividends and other than as provided in paragraph (B)(1) of this Section 2) shall be declared or paid or set aside for payment or other distribution
declared or made upon the Common Stock or upon any other shares ranking junior to or on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends,
nor shall any Common Stock or any other shares of the Company ranking junior to or on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends be
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any moneys be paid to or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption
of any such shares) by the Company (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of the Company ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock
as to dividends) unless, in each case, the full cumulative dividends on all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid.
(3) Any dividend payment made on shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid
dividend due with respect to shares of Series B Preferred Stock.
3. Liquidation Preference.
(A) In the event of any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution
of the assets of the Company (whether capital or surplus) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of any series or class or classes of stock of
the Company ranking junior to Series B Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive the Series B Liquidation Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of dissolution or liquidation plus an amount equal to all
dividends accrued (whether or not accumulated) and unpaid thereon to the date of final distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be
entitled to any further payments. The Series B Liquidation Price per share which holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall receive upon dissolution
or liquidation shall be $52.24 5, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided. If, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the assets of
the Company, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to pay in full the preferential
amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any other shares ranking as to dissolution or liquidation, on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock,
then such assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other shares ratably in
accordance with the respective amounts which would be payable on such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any such other shares if all
amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes of this Section 3, a consolidation or merger of the Company with one or more
corporations shall not be deemed to be a dissolution or liquidation, voluntary or involuntary.
(B) Subject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series or class or classes of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to Series B
Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation, upon any dissolution or liquidation of the Company, after payment shall have been made in full to
the holders of Series B Preferred Stock as provided in this Section 3, but not prior thereto, any other series or class or classes of stock ranking junior
to Series B Preferred Stock upon dissolution or liquidation shall, subject to the respective terms and provisions (if any) applying thereto, be entitled
to receive any and all assets remaining to be paid or distributed, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to share therein.
4. Ranking of Shares.
Any shares of the Company shall be deemed to rank:
(A) prior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if the holders of such
class shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or
priority to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock;
(B) on a parity with Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, whether or not
the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of Series B Preferred Stock,
if the holders of such class of stock and Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon
dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend or liquidation amounts, as the case may be, without
preference or priority one over the other; and
(C) junior to Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or as to the distribution of assets upon dissolution or liquidation, if such shares
shall be Common Stock or if the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon
dissolution or liquidation, as the case may be, in preference or priority to the holders of such shares.
