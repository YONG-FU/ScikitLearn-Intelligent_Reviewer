APPENDIX A 4
SERIES A ESOP CONVERTIBLE CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK
(hereinafter referred to as Series A Preferred Stock)
1. Issuance and Cancellation.
(A) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock redeemed or purchased by the Company shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of
authorized but unissued shares of Class A Preferred Stock.
(B) Shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be issued only to a trustee or trustees acting on behalf of an employee stock ownership trust
or plan or other employee benefit plan of the Company. In the event of any transfer of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to any person other than
any such plan trustee or trustees, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so transferred, upon such transfer and without any further action by the
Company or the holder, shall be automatically converted into shares of Common Stock on the terms otherwise provided for the conversion of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof and no such transferee shall have any of the voting
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or special rights ascribed to shares of Series A Preferred Stock hereunder but, rather, only
the powers and rights pertaining to the Common Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be so converted. Certificates
representing shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be legended to reﬂect such restrictions on transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Section 1, shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) may be converted into shares of Common Stock as provided by Section 5 hereof and the
shares of Common Stock issued upon such conversion may be transferred by the holder thereof as permitted by law and (ii) shall be redeemable by
the Company upon the terms and conditions provided by Sections 6, 7 and 8 hereof.
2. Dividends and Distributions.
(A) Subject to the provisions for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor, cash dividends ("Preferred Dividends") in an
amount per share initially equal to $8.12 4 per share per annum, subject to adjustment from time to time as hereinafter provided, (such amount, as
adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Preferred Dividend Rate"), payable quarterly, one-fourth on the third day of March,
one-fourth on the third day of June, one-fourth on the third day of September, and one-fourth on the third day of December of each year (each a
"Dividend Payment Date") commencing on June 3, 1989, to holders of record at the start of business on such Dividend Payment Date, provided that
if the Board of Directors has declared since the prior Dividend Payment Date a quarterly dividend on the Common Stock at a rate that exceeds one-
fourth of the Preferred Dividend Rate in effect on such day, the holders of record on the start of business on the record date for such dividend on
the Common Stock shall be entitled to receive a cash dividend in an amount per share equal to the quarterly dividend declared on a share of
Common Stock, payable on the same date as such dividend on the Common Stock, and provided further that the Dividend Payment Date for the
Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be the same date as the record date for the dividend on the Common Stock or if no dividend is declared on
the Common Stock in any quarter, the Dividend Payment Date shall be, as appropriate, the fifteenth day of February, May, August or November or
if such days are not a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business, then the next preceding day when the New York Stock
Exchange is open for business. Preferred Dividends shall begin to accrue on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the date of
issuance of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Preferred Dividends shall accrue on a daily basis, based on the Preferred Dividend Rate in
effect on such day, whether or not the Company shall have earnings or surplus at the time, but Preferred Dividends accrued after March 3, 1989 on
the shares of Series A Preferred Stock for any period less than a full quarterly period between Dividend Payment Dates shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of 30-day months. A full quarterly dividend payment of $2.034 per share shall accrue for the period from the date of issuance
until June 3, 1989. Accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends shall cumulate as of the Dividend Payment Date on which they first become
payable, but no interest shall accrue on accumulated but unpaid Preferred Dividends.
4 As a result of four two—for-one stock splits on the Common Stock effective October 20, 1989, May 15, 1992, August 22, 1997 and May 21, 2004, and the
Smucker transaction effective June 1, 2002, the Conversion Price, Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate were all adjusted in accordance with the terms
of paragraph 9(A)(1) of this Appendix A to be as follows: Conversion Price -- $6.82; Liquidation Price -- $6.82; Preferred Dividend Rate -- $.5036075 per share
per annum, with a corresponding change in the quarterly dividend payment. (This footnote is not a part of the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation
but is included to provide up—to-date information on the status of Series A ESOP Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.)
