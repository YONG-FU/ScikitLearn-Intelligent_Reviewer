Adjusted Free Cash Flow. Adjusted free cash ﬂow is defined as
operating cash ﬂow less capital spending excluding tax payments
related to the divestiture of the discontinued Pet business. Adjusted
free cash ﬂow represents the cash that the Company is able to
generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset
expansion. We view adjusted free cash ﬂow as an important measure
because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash
available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other
discretionary investment.
