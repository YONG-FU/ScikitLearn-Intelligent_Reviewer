without limitation the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the other party and the social, legal, environmental
and economic effects on the employees, customers, suppliers and other affected persons, firms and corporations and on the
communities and geographical areas in which the Company and its subsidiaries Operate or are located and on any of the business and
properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as well as such other factors as the Directors deem relevant; and (B) the amount
and form of the consideration being offered in relation to the then current market price for the Company's outstanding shares of capital
stock, in relation to the then current value of the Company in a freely negotiated transaction or transactions and in relation to the
Board of Directors' estimate of the future value of the Company (including the unrealized value of its properties and assets) as an
independent concern. In evaluating any such offer, the Board of Directors shall be deemed to be performing their duly authorized
duties and acting in good faith and in the best interests of the Company within the meaning of Section 1701.13 of the Ohio Revised
Code, as it may be amended from time to time, and the Company's Regulations.
4. The statutes of Ohio require that action on certain specified matters at a shareholders' meeting shall be taken by the affirmative vote of
the holders of more than a majority of shares entitled to vote thereon, unless other provision is made in the Articles of Incorporation. On all
these specified matters action may be taken by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares entitled to vote thereon or, if the vote is required to
be by classes, by the affirmative vote of a majority of each class of shares entitled to vote thereon as a class, except that any amendment,
alteration, addition to or repeal of this Article Sixth and of any of the matters specified above in Section 3 of this Article Sixth as requiring a
vote other than the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon, may only be taken, (1) prior to the date
of the annual meeting in 1990, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class; (2) from the date of the annual
meeting in 1990 to, and including the date of the annual meeting in 2000, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class,
provided that during such period said vote may be increased at any time to the affirmative vote of the holders of at least eighty percent (80%)
of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company by a resolution adopted by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the whole
Board of Directors 3 ; (3) after the date of the annual meeting in 2000, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, considered for the purposes of this Section 4 as one class.
Seventh: No holder of shares of any class shall have the right to vote cumulatively in the election of Directors.
Eighth: Each nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors by a vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to such
nominee at any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided, however, that if the number of
nominees for directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes (up to the number of
directors to be elected) shall be elected. For purposes of this provision, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted “for” a
nominee must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that nominee.
3 On October 9, 1990, in accordance with this provision, the vote required was increased to 80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company. (This
