are issued, any adjustment of the Series B Conversion Price unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent
(1%) in the Series B Conversion Price. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward and shall be made no later than the time of, and together with,
the next subsequent adjustment which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of
at least one percent (1%) of the number of Series B Preferred Shares outstanding or, if no additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock are being
issued, an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of the Series B Conversion Price, whichever the case may be.
(E) If the Company shall make any dividend or distribution on the Common Stock or issue any Common Stock, other capital stock or
other security of the Company or any rights or warrants to purchase or acquire any such security, which transaction does not result in an
appr0priate adjustment to the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding or the Series B Conversion Price pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 9, the Board of Directors of the Company may, in its sole discretion, consider whether such action is of such a nature that
some type of equitable adjustment should be made in respect of such transaction. If in such case the Board of Directors of the Company determines
that some type of adjustment should be made, an equitable adjustment not repugnant to law and for the protection of the conversion rights of the
Series B Preferred Stock shall be made effective as of such date, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. The determination of the
Board of Directors of the Company as to whether some type of adjustment should be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 9
(E), and, if so, as to what adjustment should be made and when, shall be final and binding on the Company and all shareholders of the Company.
The Company shall be entitled to make such additional adjustments, in addition to those required by the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, as
shall be necessary in order that any dividend or distribution in shares of capital stock of the Company, subdivision, reclassification or combination
of shares of the Company or any recapitalization of the Company shall not be taxable to holders of the Common Stock.
(F) For purposes of this Appendix B, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) "Extraordinary Distribution" shall mean any dividend or other distribution (effected while any of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock
are outstanding) of (i) cash, where the aggregate amount of such cash dividend or distribution together with the amount of all cash dividends and
distributions made during the preceding period of twelve (12) months, when combined with the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Repurchases [for
this purpose, including only that portion of the aggregate purchase price of such Pro Rata Repurchase which is in excess of the Fair Market Value
of the Common Stock repurchased as determined on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer or exchange
offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or the date of purchase with respect to any other Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a tender offer or exchange
offer] made during such period, exceeds twelve and one-half percent (12%%) of the aggregate Fair Market Value of all shares of Common Stock
outstanding on the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to receive such Extraordinary Distribution and (ii) any shares of capital
stock of the Company (other than shares of Common Stock), other securities of the Company (other than securities of the type referred to in
paragraph (B) of this Section 9), evidences of indebtedness of the Company or any other person or any other property (including shares of any
subsidiary of the Company), or any combination thereof. The Fair Market Value of an Extraordinary Distribution for purposes of paragraph (C) of
this Section 9 shall be the sum of the Fair Market Value of such Extraordinary Distribution plus the aggregate amount of any cash dividends or
distributions which are not Extraordinary Distributions made during such twelve month period and not included in the calculation of any previous
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (C) of this Section 9.
(2) "F air Market Value" shall mean, as to shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital stock or securities of the Company or any
other issuer which are publicly traded, the average of the Current Market Prices (as hereinafter defined) of such shares or securities for each day of
the Adjustment Period (as hereinafter defined). "Current Market Price" of publicly traded shares of Common Stock or any other class of capital
stock or other security of the Company or any other issuer for a day shall mean the last reported sales price, regular way, or, in case no sale takes
place on such day, the average reported closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Tape or, if such security is not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the principal national securities
exchange on which such security is listed or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, on the
NASDAQ National Market System or, if such security is not quoted on such National Market System, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices on each such day in the overâ€”the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices for such security on each such day
shall not have been reported through NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for such day as furnished by any New York Stock
Exchange member firm regularly making a market in such security selected for such purpose by the Board of Directors of the Company on each
trading day during the Adjustment Period. "Adjustment Period" shall mean the period of five (5) consecutive trading days, selected by the Board of
Directors of the Company, during the twenty (20) trading days preceding, and including, the date as of which the Fair Market Value of a security is
to be determined. The "Fair Market Value" of any security which is not publicly traded or of any other property shall mean the fair value thereof as
determined by an independent investment banking or appraisal firm experienced in the valuation of such securities or property selected in good
faith by the Board of Directors
