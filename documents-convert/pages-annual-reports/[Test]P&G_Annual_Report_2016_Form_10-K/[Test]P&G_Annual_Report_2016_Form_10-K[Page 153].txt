Article 6. Restrictions and Covenants
6.1 Participant Obligations. In addition to such other conditions as may be established by the Committee, in consideration of the
granting of an Award under the terms of the Plan, each Employee who is a Participant agrees as follows:
(a) The right to exercise any Option or Stock Appreciation Right shall be conditional upon certification by the Participant at time
of exercise whether the Participant either intends to remain in the employ of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries for at least one
(1) year following the date of exercise of the Option or SAR or intends to leave the Company or one of its Subsidiaries within one
(1) year following the date of exercise of the Option or SAR, but has no intention to engage in any activity that would Violate the
non-compete provisions of Article 6.
(b) In order to better protect the goodwill of the Company and its affiliates and Subsidiaries and to prevent the disclosure of the
Company’s or its affiliates’ or Subsidiaries’ confidential and proprietary trade secret information and thereby help ensure the
long-term success of the business, the Participant, without prior written consent of the Chief Human Resources Officer of and
Chief Legal Officer of the Company, will not engage in any activity or provide any services, whether as a director, manager,
supervisor, employee, adviser, consultant or otherwise, for a period of three (3) years following the date of the Participant’s
Termination of Employment, in connection with the manufacture, development, advertising, promotion, or sale of any product
which is the same as or similar to or competitive with any products of the Company or its affiliates or Subsidiaries (including both
existing products as well as products known to the Participant, as a consequence of the Participant’s employment with the
Company or one of its affiliates or Subsidiaries, to be in development):
(i) with respect to which the Participant’s work has been directly concerned at any time during the two (2) years
preceding Termination of Employment, or
(ii) with respect to which the Participant, as a consequence of the Participant’s job performance and duties, acquired
knowledge of confidential and proprietary trade secret information of the Company or its affiliates or Subsidiaries.
For purposes of this Section 6.1(b), it shall be conclusively presumed that Participants have knowledge of information they were
directly exposed to through actual receipt or review of memos or documents containing such information, or through actual
attendance at meetings at which such information was discussed or disclosed.
(c) To better protect the Company’s investment in its employees and to ensure the long-term success of the business, the
Participant, without prior written consent of the Company, will not attempt directly or indirectly to induce any employee of the
Company or its affiliates or Subsidiaries to be employed or perform services elsewhere or attempt directly or indirectly to solicit
the trade or business of any customer or partner of the Company or its affiliates or Subsidiaries.
(d) Because a main purpose of the Plan is to strengthen the alignment of interests between employees of the Company
(including all affiliates and Subsidiaries) and its shareholders to ensure the continued success of the Company, the Participant
will not take any action that is significantly contrary to the best interests of the Company or its affiliates or Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Section 6.1(d), an action taken “significantly contrary to the best interests of the Company or its affiliates or
Subsidiaries” includes without limitation any action taken or threatened by the Participant that the Committee determines has, or
is reasonably likely to have, a significant adverse impact on the reputation, goodwill, stability, operation, personnel retention and
management, or business of the Company or any affiliate or Subsidiary.
(e) The provisions of this Article 6 are not in lieu of, but are in addition to, the continuing obligation of the Participant (which
the Participant acknowledges by accepting any Award under the Plan) to not use or disclose the Company's or its affiliates’ or
Subsidiaries' confidential and proprietary trade secret information known to the Participant until any particular confidential and
proprietary trade secret information becomes generally known (through no fault of the Participant), whereupon the restriction on
use and disclosure shall cease as to that item. Information regarding products in development, in test marketing or being marketed
or promoted in a discrete geographic region, which information the Company or one of its affiliates or Subsidiaries is considering
for broader use, shall not be deemed generally known until such broader use is actually commercially implemented. As used in
this Article 6, "generally known" means known throughout the domestic U. S. industry
