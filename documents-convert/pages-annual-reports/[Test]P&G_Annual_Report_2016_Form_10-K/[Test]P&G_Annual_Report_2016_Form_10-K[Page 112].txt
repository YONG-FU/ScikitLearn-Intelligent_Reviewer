(the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that could be acquired
upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the Fair Market
Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of all such
rights or warrants. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1), the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and
the Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price, the Liquidation Price and
the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants by the Non-dilutive Share Amount
determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(B)(1).
(2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are
necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is
precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(B)(l), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but
instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such issuance of rights
or warrants by the Non-Dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(B)(1), and the Liquidation Price and Preferred Dividend Rate will
not be adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(B)(1), then such
automatic adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(B)(1) and the adjustment in the Conversion Price as provided in
this paragraph 9(B)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively.
(C)(l) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the
shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, make an Extraordinary Distribution (as hereinafter defined) in respect of the Common Stock,
whether by dividend, distribution, reclassification of shares or recapitalization of the Company (including recapitalization or reclassification effected
by a merger or consolidation to which Section 8 hereof does not apply) or effect a Pro Rata Repurchase (as hereinafter defined) of Common Stock,
then, in such event, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company,
become that number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator
of which is the product of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
Repurchase minus, in the case of a Pro Rata Repurchase, the number of shares of Common Stock repurchased by the Company multiplied by (b) the
Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution or on the applicable expiration date
(including all extensions thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata
Repurchase which is not a tender offer, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is (i) the product of (x) the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value of a share of
Common Stock on the record date with respect to an Extraordinary Distribution, or on the applicable expiration date (including all extensions
thereof) of any tender offer which is a Pro Rata Repurchase, or on the date of purchase with respect to any Pro Rata Repurchase which is not a
tender offer, as the case may be, minus (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Extraordinary Distribution or the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata
Repurchase, as the case may be. The Company shall send each holder of Series A Preferred Stock (i) notice of its intent to make any dividend or
distribution and (ii) notice of any offer by the Company to make a Pro Rata Repurchase, in each case at the same time as, or as soon as practicable
after, such offer is first communicated (including by announcement of a record date in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange on which
the Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading) to holders of Common Stock. Such notice shall indicate the intended record date and the amount
and nature of such dividend or distribution, or the number of shares subject to such offer for a Pro Rata Repurchase and the purchase price payable
by the Company pursuant to such offer, as well as the Conversion Price and the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Series A
Preferred Stock may be converted at such time. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(l), the Conversion
Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion
Price, the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate, respectively, in effect immediately before such Extraordinary Distribution or Pro Rata
Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(C)(l).
(2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are
necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(l). In the event for any reason the Company is
precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(C)(l), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but
instead the Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such Extraordinary
Distribution or Pro Rata Repurchase by the Non-dilutive Share Amount, and the Liquidation Price and the Preferred Dividend Rate will not be
adjusted. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(C)(l), then such automatic
adjustment will proceed
