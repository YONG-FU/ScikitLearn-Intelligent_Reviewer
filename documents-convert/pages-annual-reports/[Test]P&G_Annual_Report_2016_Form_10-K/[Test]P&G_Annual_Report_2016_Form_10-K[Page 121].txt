amount of shares, securities, cash or other property receivable upon such transaction for each non-electing share shall be the kind and amount so
receivable per share by a plurality of non-electing shares).
(C) In the event the Company shall enter into any agreement providing for any consolidation or merger or similar transaction described in
paragraph (B) of this Section 8, then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter (and in any event at least ten (10) business days before
consummation of such transaction) give notice of such agreement and the material terms thereof to each holder of Series B Preferred Stock and each
such holder shall have the right to elect, by written notice to the Company, to receive, upon consummation of such transaction (if and when such
transaction is consummated), from the Company or the successor of the Company, in redemption and retirement of such Series B Preferred Stock, a
cash payment equal to the Series B Liquidation Price in effect on the date set for redemption plus all accrued (whether or not accumulated) and
unpaid dividends. No such notice of redemption shall be effective unless given to the Company prior to the close of business on the fifth business
day prior to consummation of such transaction, unless the Company or the successor of the Company shall waive such prior notice, but any notice
of redemption so given prior to such time may be withdrawn by notice of withdrawal given to the Company prior to the close of business on the
fifth business day prior to consummation of such transaction.
9. Anti-dilution Adjustments.
(A)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the
shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, (i) pay a dividend or make a distribution in respect of the Common Stock in shares of
Common Stock or (ii) subdivide or combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater or lesser number of shares, in each case whether
by reclassification of shares, recapitalization of the Company (excluding a recapitalization or reclassification effected by a merger or consolidation to
which Section 8 hereof applies) or otherwise, then, in such event, each share of Series B Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal
to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event. An adjustment pursuant to this
paragraph 9(A)(1) shall be effective upon payment of such dividend or distribution in respect of the Common Stock and in the case of a subdivision
or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date thereof Concurrently with the automatic adjustment pursuant to this
paragraph 9(A)(1), the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate of all shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price, the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred Dividend Rate,
respectively, in effect immediately before the event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(l).
(2) The Company and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to take all necessary steps or to take all actions as are
necessary or appropriate for implementation of the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1). In the event for any reason the Company is
precluded from giving full effect to the automatic adjustment provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then no such automatic adjustment shall occur, but
instead the Series B Conversion Price shall automatically be adjusted by dividing the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately before the
event by the Non-dilutive Share Amount determined pursuant to paragraph 9(A)(1), and the Series B Liquidation Price and the Series B Preferred
Dividend Rate will not be adjusted. An adjustment to the Series B Conversion Price made pursuant to this paragraph 9(A)(2) shall be given effect,
upon payment of such a dividend or distribution, as of the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or
distribution (on a retroactive basis) and in the case of a subdivision or combination shall become effective immediately as of the effective date
thereof. If subsequently the Company is able to give full effect to the automatic adjustment as provided in paragraph 9(A)(1), then such automatic
adjustment will proceed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9(A)(1) and the adjustment in the Series B Conversion Price as provided in
this paragraph 9(A)(2) will automatically be reversed and nullified prospectively.
(B)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 9(D), in the event the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the
shares of Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, issue to holders of shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution, including by way of a
reclassification of shares or a recapitalization of the Company, any right or warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock (but not including as such
a right or warrant any security convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) at a purchase price per share less than the Fair Market
Value (as hereinafter defined) of a share of Common Stock on the date of issuance of such right or warrant, then, in such event, each share of Series
B Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, become that number of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock (the "Non-dilutive Share Amount") equal to an amount which is a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that
could be acquired upon exercise in full of all such rights and warrants and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately before such issuance of rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which could be purchased at the
Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time of such issuance for the maximum aggregate consideration payable upon exercise in full of
all such rights or warrants. Concurrently with the automatic adjustment
