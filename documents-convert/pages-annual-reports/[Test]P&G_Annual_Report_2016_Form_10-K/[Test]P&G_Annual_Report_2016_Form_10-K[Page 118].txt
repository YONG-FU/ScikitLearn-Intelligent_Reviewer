5. Conversion into Common Stock.
(A) A holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cause any or all of such shares to be converted into shares of
Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of the Series B Preferred Stock may be converted shall be determined
by dividing the Series B Liquidation Price in effect at the time of conversion by the Series B Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) in effect at the
time of conversion. The Series B Conversion Price per share at which shares of Common Stock shall be initially issuable upon conversion of any
shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall be $52.24 5, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.
(B) Any holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock desiring to convert such shares into shares of Common Stock shall surrender, if
certificated, the certificate or certificates representing the shares of Series B Preferred Stock being converted, duly assigned or endorsed for transfer
to the Company (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers relating thereto), or if uncertificated, a duly executed stock power relating thereto,
at the principal executive office of the Company or the offices of the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock or such office or offices in the
continental United States or an agent for conversion as may from time to time be designated by notice to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock
by the Company or the transfer agent for the Series B Preferred Stock, accompanied by written notice of conversion. Such notice of conversion
shall specify (i) the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted and the name or names in which such holder wishes the Common
Stock and any shares of Series B Preferred Stock not to be so converted to be issued, and (ii) the address to which such holder wishes delivery to
be made of a confirmation of such conversion, if uncertificated, or any new certificates which may be issued upon such conversion if certificated.
(C) Upon surrender, if certificated, of a certificate representing a share or shares of Series B Preferred Stock for conversion, or if
uncertificated, of a duly executed stock power relating thereto, the Company shall issue and send by hand delivery (with receipt to be
acknowledged) or by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the holder thereof or to such holder's designee, at the address designated by such holder,
if certificated, a certificate or certificates for, or if uncertificated, confirmation of, the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall
be entitled upon conversion. In the event that there shall have been surrendered shares of Series B Preferred Stock, only part of which are to be
converted, the Company shall issue and deliver to such holder or such holder's designee, if certificated, a new certificate or certificates representing
the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted, or if uncertificated, confirmation of the number of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock which shall not have been converted.
(D) The issuance by the Company of shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of
Common Stock made at the option of the holder thereof shall be effective as of the earlier of (i) the delivery to such holder or such holder's designee
of the certificates representing the shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion thereof if certificated or confirmation if uncertificated or (ii) the
commencement of business on the second business day after the surrender of the certificate or certificates, if certificated, or a duly executed stock
power, if uncertificated, for the shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be converted. On and after the effective date of conversion, the person or
persons entitled to receive Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such
shares of Common Stock, but no allowance or adjustment shall be made in respect of dividends payable to holders of Common Stock of record on
any date prior to such effective date. The Company shall not be obligated to pay any dividends which shall have been declared and shall be
payable to holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on a Series B Dividend Payment Date if such Series B Dividend Payment Date for such
dividend shall be on or subsequent to the effective date of conversion of such shares.
(E) The Company shall not be obligated to deliver to holders of Series B Preferred Stock any fractional share or shares of Common Stock
issuable upon any conversion of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, but in lieu thereof may make a cash payment in respect thereof in any
manner permitted by law.
(F) The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or treasury Common
Stock, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock
as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.
