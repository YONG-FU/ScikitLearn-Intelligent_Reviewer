as apprOpriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and Net operating loss carryforwards were $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at
forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. If unused, $1.0 billion will expire
settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information between 2016 and 2035. The remainder, totaling $2.2 billion at June 30,
currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, 2016, may be carried forward indefinitely.
audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in
multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of
approximately $250, including interest and penalties.
Accounting pronouncements require that, without discretion, we
recognize the additional accrual of any possible related interest and
penalties relating to the underlying uncertain tax position in income tax
expense, unless the Company qualifies for a specific exception. As of
June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had accrued interest of $323, $347 and
$411 and accrued penalties of $20, $19 and $32, respectively, which are
not included in the above table. During the fiscal years ended June 30,
2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $2, $15 and $(6) in interest benefit/
(expense) and $(2), $13 and $2 in penalties benefit/(expense),
respectively. The net benefits recognized resulted primarily from the
favorable resolution of tax positions for prior years.
