MINERALS TECHNOLOGIES INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax beneﬁts:
I | 2016 | 2015 I
I (millions of dollars) I
Balance at beginning of the year $ 4.0 $ 5.0
Increases related to current year tax positions 8.8 0.5
Increases related to new judgements 0.9 0.8
Decreases related to audit settlements and statue expirations - (2.3)
Balance at the end of the year $ 13.7 $ 4.0
The Company's accounting policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued, relating to unrecognized income tax
beneﬁts as part of its provision for income taxes. The Company had recorded a $0.3 million beneﬁt in interest and penalties
during 2016 and had a total accrued balance on December 31, 2016 of $1.2 million.
The Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within and outside the US. In certain situations, a taxing
authority may challenge positions that the Company has adopted in its income tax ﬁlings. The Company, with a few
exceptions (none of which are material), is no longer subject to US. federal, state, local, and European income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2010.
Net cash paid for income taxes were $30.6 million, $43.8 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company has not provided for US. federal and foreign withholding taxes on $560.3 million of foreign subsidiaries'
undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2016 because such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested overseas.
To the extent the parent company has received foreign earnings as dividends; the foreign taxes paid on those earnings have
generated tax credits, which have substantially offset related US. income taxes. However, in the event that the entire $560.3
million of foreign earnings were to be repatriated, incremental taxes may be incurred. We do not believe this amount would
be more than $89.7 million.
