The acquisition of AMCOL has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires,
among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their respective fair values as of the
acquisition date. As of May 9, 2015, the Company has completed its assessment of property, certain reserves (including
environmental, legal, and tax matters), obligations and deferred taxes, as well as our review of AMCOL’s existing accounting
policies. The purchase price allocation has been ﬁnalized.
The following table summarizes the ﬁnal amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the
acquisition date, as well as adjustments made in 2015 to the amounts initially recorded in 2014 (measurement period
adjustments). The measurement period adjustments did not have a signiﬁcant impact on our consolidated statements of
income, balance sheets or cash ﬂows in any period and therefore, we have not retrospectively adjusted our ﬁnancial
statements.

The Company used the income, market, or cost approach (or a combination thereof) for the preliminary valuation, and
used valuation inputs and analyses that were based on market participant assumptions. Market participants are considered to
be buyers and sellers unrelated to the Company in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. For
certain items, the carrying value was determined to be a reasonable approximation of fair value based on the information
available. The Company’s estimates related to this valuation are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they
are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors and due to the
uncontrollable variability of market factors underlying them. For example, in performing assessments of the fair value of
these assets, the Company makes judgments about the future performance business of the acquired business, economic,
regulatory, and political conditions affecting the net assets acquired, appropriate risk-related rates for discounting estimated
future cash ﬂows, reasonable estimates of disposal values, and market royalty rate.
Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the assets acquired and represents the
estimated future economic beneﬁts arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identiﬁed and separately
recognized. The goodwill is primarily attributable to fair value of expected synergies from combining the MTI and AMCOL
businesses and will be allocated to the Performance Materials and Construction Technologies segments. Goodwill recognized
as a result of this acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded an additional deferred tax liability of $323.8 million with a
corresponding increase to goodwill. The increase in deferred tax liability represents the tax effect of the difference between
the estimated assigned fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and the tax basis of such assets.
