On May 9, 2014, in connection with the acquisition of AMCOL International Corporation (“AMCOL”), the
Company entered into a credit agreement providing for a $1,560 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Term
Facility”) and a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and, together with the Term
Facility, the “F acilities”).
On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the credit agreement to
reprice the $1.378 billion then outstanding on the Term Facility. As amended by the First Amendment, the Term Facility had
a $1.078 billion ﬂoating rate tranche and a $300 million ﬁxed rate tranche. On February 14, 2017, the Company entered into
an amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the credit agreement to reprice the $788 million ﬂoating rate tranche then
outstanding. See Note 24. The maturity date for loans under the Term Facility was not changed by the First Amendment.
As amended by the First Amendment, the loans outstanding under the Term Facility matured on May 9, 2021 and the loans
outstanding (if any) and commitments under the Revolving Facility will mature and terminate, as the case may be, on May 9,
2019. After the First Amendment and until the Second Amendment, loans under the variable rate tranche of the Term
Facility bore interest at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate (subject to a ﬂoor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin equal
to 3.00% per annum. Loans under the ﬁxed rate tranche of the Term Facility bear interest at a rate of 4.75%. Loans under
the Revolving Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.75%
per annum. Such rates are subject to decrease by up to 25 basis points in the event that, and for so long as, the Company’s
net leverage ratio (as deﬁned in the credit agreement) is less than certain thresholds. The variable rate tranche of the Term
Facility was issued at par and had a 1% required amortization per year under the First Amendment. The obligations of the
Company under the Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally by, subject to certain exceptions, all
material domestic subsidiaries of the Company (the “Guarantors”) and secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a security
interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors.
The credit agreement contains certain customary afﬁrmative and negative covenants that limit or restrict the ability of
the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions or take certain actions. In addition, the credit
agreement contains a ﬁnancial covenant that requires the Company, if on the last day of any ﬁscal quarter loans or letters of
credit were outstanding under the Revolving Facility (excluding up to $15 million of letters of credit), to maintain a
maximum net leverage ratio (as deﬁned in the credit agreement) of, initially, 5.25 to 1.00 for the four ﬁscal quarter period
preceding such day. Such maximum net leverage ratio requirement is subject to decrease during the duration of the facility to
a minimum level (when applicable) of 3.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2016, there were no loans and $12.2 million in
letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Facility. The Company is in compliance with all the covenants associated
with the Revolving Facility as of the end of the period covered by this report.
During 2016, the Company repaid $190 million on its Term Facility.
The Company has ﬁve committed loan facilities for the funding of new manufacturing facilities in China, for a
combined 94.8 million RMB and $1.8 million. In December 2016, the Company entered into a committed loan facility in
Japan in the amount of 680 million Yen (approximately $5.8 million). As of December 31, 2016, on a combined basis, $15.0
million was outstanding. Principal will be repaid in accordance with the payment schedules ending in 2021. The Company
repaid $3.2 million on these loans in 2016.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $34.8 million in uncommitted short-term bank credit lines, of which
approximately $6.1 million was in use.
