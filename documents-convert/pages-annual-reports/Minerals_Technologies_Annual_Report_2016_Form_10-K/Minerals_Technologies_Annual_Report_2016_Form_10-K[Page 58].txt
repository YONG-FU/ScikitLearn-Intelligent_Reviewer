Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided from continuing operations in 2016 was $225.0 million, compared with $270.0 million in prior year. Cash ﬂows
provided from operations in 2016 were principally used for repayment of debt, to fund capital expenditures and pay the Company's
dividend to common shareholders. The Company’s intention continues to be to use excess cash ﬂow primarily to repay debt and to de-
lever as quickly as possible. In 2016, the Company repaid $193 million in principal amount of its long-term debt.
On May 9, 2014, in connection with the acquisition of AMCOL, the Company entered into a credit agreement providing for the
$1.560 billion senior secured term loan facility (the “Term Facility”) and a $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the
“Revolving Facility” and, together with the Term Facility, the “F acilities”). The net proceeds of the Term Facility, together with the
Company’s cash on hand, were used as cash consideration for the acquisition of AMCOL and to reﬁnance certain existing
indebtedness of the Company (including the Company’s 3.46% Series A Senior Notes due October 7, 2020 and 4.13% Series B Senior
Notes due October 7, 2023) and AMCOL and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. Loans under the Revolving
Facility will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.
On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the credit agreement to reprice the
$1.378 billion then outstanding on the Term Facility. As amended, the Term Facility had a $1.078 billion ﬂoating rate tranche and a
$300 million ﬁxed rate tranche. On February 14, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the
credit agreement to reprice the $788 million ﬂoating rate tranche then outstanding. Following the Second Amendment, the loans
outstanding under the ﬂoating rate tranche of the Term Facility will mature on February 14, 2024, the loans outstanding under the
ﬁxed rate tranche of the Term Facility will mature on May 9, 2021 and the loans outstanding (if any) and commitments under the
Revolving Facility will mature and terminate, as the case may be, on May 9, 2019. After the Second Amendment, loans under the
