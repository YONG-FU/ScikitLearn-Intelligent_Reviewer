The letter to shareholders and other information set forth in the front part of this Annual Report present ﬁnancial
measures of the Company that exclude certain special items, and are therefore not in accordance With GAAP. The
following is a presentation of the Company's non-GAAP income and operating income, excluding special items, and
EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and a reconciliation to GAAP net income and
operating income, respectively, for such periods. The Company's management believes these non-GAAP measures
provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance as inclusion of such special items are not

Company feels inclusion of these non-GAAP measures also provides consistency in its ﬁnancial reporting and
facilitates investors' understanding of historic operating trends.
