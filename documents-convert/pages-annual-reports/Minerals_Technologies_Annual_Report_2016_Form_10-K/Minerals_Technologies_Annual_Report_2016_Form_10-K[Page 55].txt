The factors having the most signiﬁcant impact on our effective tax rates in recent periods are the rate differentials related to foreign
earnings indeﬁnitely invested, percentage depletion, and the tax beneﬁts on restructuring and impairment charges at a higher rate.
Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves) are available
to us under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States. The tax beneﬁts from percentage
depletion were $11.3 million in 2016, $11.2 million in 2015 and $9.5 million in 2014.
We operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws, tax incentives and tax rates that are signiﬁcantly different than
those of the United States. These differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the United States
statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the United States. The effects of foreign earnings and the
related foreign rate differentials resulted in a decrease of income tax expense of $14.7 million, $11.0 million and $11.7 million in
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Income from Continuing Operations, Net of Tax
Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was $137.1 million in 2016 and included a $24.0 million charge, net of tax. Such
charge consisted of restructuring and other net items, acquisition transaction and integration costs and lease termination costs,
inventory write-offs and impairment of assets relating to the Company’s exit from the Nitrogen and Pipeline product lines and the
restructuring of other onshore services within the Energy Services segment.
Income from continuing operations, net of tax, was $111.6 million during 2015 and included a $43.1 million charge, net of tax.
Such charge consisted of restructuring and other charges, acquisition transaction and integration costs, debt prepayment costs, and the
write down of an investment in a development stage enterprise.
Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of tax
The Company recognized income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $2.1 million during 2014 relating its discontinued
operations at its merchant PCC facility at Walsum, Germany.

2016 v 2015
Net sales in the Specialty Minerals segment decreased 5 percent to $591.5 million from $624.6 million. Higher sales in our
Processed Minerals product line, stemming from increased ground calcium carbonate volumes were offset by declines in Paper PCC.
Worldwide net sales of PCC products, which are primarily used in the manufacturing process of the paper industry, decreased $35.9
million, or 7 percent. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on PCC products sales $9.7 million, or 2 percentage points. The
decrease in Paper PCC sales was primarily due to several previously announced paper mill closures in the US and weaker printing
and writing paper demand in the US. and Europe. This was partially offset by an increase in PCC sales in China of 12 percent over
last year due to the ramp-up of two new facilities and the successful startup of a 100,000 ton satellite in the third quarter of 2016.
