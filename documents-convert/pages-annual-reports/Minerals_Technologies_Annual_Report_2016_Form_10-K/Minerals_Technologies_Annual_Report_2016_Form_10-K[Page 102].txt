Note 15. Beneﬁt Plans
Pension Plans and Other Postrez‘irement Beneﬁt Plans
The Company and its subsidiaries have pension plans covering the majority of eligible employees on a contributory or
non-contributory basis. Beneﬁts under deﬁned beneﬁt plans are generally based on years of service and an employee's career
earnings. Employees generally become fully vested after ﬁve years.
The Company also provides postretirement health care and life insurance beneﬁts for the majority of its US. retired
employees. Employees are generally eligible for beneﬁts upon retirement and completion of a speciﬁed number of years of
creditable service. The Company does not pre-fund these beneﬁts and has the right to modify or terminate the plan in the
future.
In May 2014, as a part of its acquisition of AMCOL businesses, the Company assumed AMCOL’s qualiﬁed deﬁned
beneﬁt pension plan, supplementary pension plan (SERP) and deﬁned contribution plan. The deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan
covers substantially all of AMCOL’s domestic employees hired before January 1, 2004. The SERP plan provides beneﬁt in
excess of qualiﬁed plan limitation for certain employees. AMCOL’s domestic employees hired on or after January 1, 2004
participate in AMCOL’s deﬁned contribution plan whereby the Company will make a retirement contribution into the
employee’s savings plan equal to 3% of their compensation. For more information on the AMCOL acquisition, see Note 2.
The Company’s disclosures for the US. plans have been combined with those outside of the US. as the international
plans do not have signiﬁcantly different assumptions, and together represent less than 25% of our total beneﬁt obligation.
