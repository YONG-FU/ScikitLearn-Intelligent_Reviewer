by agreement, been left unresolved. Though the cost of the likely remediation remains uncertain pending completion of the phased
remediation decision process, we have estimated that the Company’s share of the cost of the encapsulation and limited soil removal
described above would approximate $0.4 million, which has been accrued as of December 31, 2016.
The Company is evaluating options for upgrading the wastewater treatment facilities at its Adams, Massachusetts plant. This
work has been undertaken pursuant to an administrative Consent Order originally issued by the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (“DEP”) on June 18, 2002. This order was amended on June 1, 2009 and on June 2, 2010. The amended
Order includes the investigation by January 1, 2022 of options for ensuring that the facility's wastewater treatment ponds will not
result in unpermitted discharge to groundwater. Additional requirements of the amendment include the submittal by July 1, 2022 of a
plan for closure of a historic lime solids disposal area. Preliminary engineering reviews completed in 2005 indicate that the estimated
cost of wastewater treatment upgrades to operate this facility beyond 2024 may be between $6 million and $8 million. The Company
estimates that the remaining remediation costs would approximate $0.4 million, which has been accrued as of December 31, 2016.
