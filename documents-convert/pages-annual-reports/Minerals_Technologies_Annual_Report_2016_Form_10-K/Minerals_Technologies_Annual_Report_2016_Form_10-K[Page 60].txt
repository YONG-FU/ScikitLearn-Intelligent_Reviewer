Contractual Obligations
The Company has committed cash outﬂow related to long-term debt, interest on long-term debt, pension and post-retirement
beneﬁt obligations, operating lease agreements, and other long-term contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2016, minimum
payments for these obligations were as follows:

Long-term debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding long-term debt, including
current portion. As of December 31, 2016, maturities for long-term debt extended to 2021. On February 14, 2017, the Company
extended the maturity of the ﬂoating rate tranche of the Term Facility to February 14, 2024.
Interest related to long-term debt is based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2016 and is calculated on debt with
maturities that, on December 31, 2016 extended to 2021. As the contractual interest rate for a portion of our debt is variable, actual
cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table. On February 14, 2017 the Company extended the
maturity of the ﬂoating rate tranche of the Term Facility to February 14, 2024.
Estimated minimum required pension funding and post-retirement beneﬁts are based on actuarial estimates using current
assumptions for discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and health care cost trend rates.
The Company has determined that it is not practicable to present expected pension funding and other postretirement beneﬁt payments
beyond 2018 and, accordingly, no amounts have been included in the table beyond such dates.
The Company has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for ofﬁce space and equipment. Operating lease obligations
includes future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable leases.
Other long term liabilities include asset retirement obligations relating to the retirement of certain tangible long-lived assets and land
restoration obligations at its PCC satellite facilities and mining operations. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The total amount of contingent obligations associated with gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts for uncertain tax positions, including
positions impacting only the timing of tax beneﬁts was $13.7 million at December 31, 2016. Payment of these obligations would
result from settlements with taxing authorities. Due to the difﬁculty in determining the timing of settlements, these obligations are not
included in the table above. We do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would
signiﬁcantly impact liquidity.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these
ﬁnancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for
doubtful accounts, valuation of inventories, valuation of long-term assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plan
assumptions, income taxes, asset retirement obligations, income tax valuation allowances, stock-based compensation, and litigation
and environmental liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from
those estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make signiﬁcant judgments and estimates in the preparation of
our consolidated ﬁnancial statements:
0 Revenue recognition: Revenue from sale of products is recognized when the title passes to the customer, the customer
assumes the risks and rewards of ownership, and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally this occurs when the goods
