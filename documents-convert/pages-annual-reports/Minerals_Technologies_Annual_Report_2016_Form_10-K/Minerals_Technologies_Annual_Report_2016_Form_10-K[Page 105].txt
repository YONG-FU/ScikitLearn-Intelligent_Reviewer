NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The weighted average assumptions used to determine beneﬁt obligations for the pension beneﬁt plans and other beneﬁt
plans at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
I I 2016 I 2015 I 2014
Discount rate 3.60% 3.89% 3.66%
Rate of compensation increase 2.96% 3.04% 3.05%
For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the discount rate was based on a Citigroup yield curve of high quality corporate bonds with cash
ﬂows matching our plans' expected beneﬁt payments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix
and our historical return, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The actual return on pension assets
was approximately 8% in 2016, 1% in 2015 and 7% in 2014.
The Company maintains a self-funded health insurance plan for its retirees. This plan provided that the maximum health
care cost trend rate would be 5%. Effective June 2010, the Company amended its plan to change the eligibility requirement
for retirees and revised its plan so that increases in expected health care costs would be borne by the retiree.
