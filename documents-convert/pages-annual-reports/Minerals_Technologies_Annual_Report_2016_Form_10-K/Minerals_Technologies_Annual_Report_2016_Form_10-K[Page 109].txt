initial public offering in 1992. Of the 18 pending asbestos cases all except two allege liability based on products sold largely
or entirely prior to the initial public offering, and for which the Company is therefore entitled to indemniﬁcation pursuant to
such agreements. The two exceptions pertain to a pending asbestos case against American Colloid Company, and one for
which no period of alleged exposure has been stated by plaintiffs. Our experience has been that the Company is not liable to
plaintiffs in any of these lawsuits and the Company does not expect to pay any settlements or jury verdicts in these lawsuits.
Environmental Matters
On April 9, 2003, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection issued an administrative consent order
relating to our Canaan, Connecticut, plant where both our Refractories segment and Specialty Minerals segment have
operations. We agreed to the order, which includes provisions requiring investigation and remediation of contamination
associated with historic use of polychlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") and mercury at a portion of the site. We have completed
the required investigations and submitted several reports characterizing the contamination and assessing site-specific risks.
We are awaiting regulators’ approval of the risk assessment report, which will form the basis for a proposal by the Company
concerning eventual remediation.
We believe that the most likely form of overall site remediation will be to leave the existing contamination in place
(with some limited soil removal), encapsulate it, and monitor the effectiveness of the encapsulation. We anticipate that a
substantial portion of the remediation cost will be borne by the United States based on its involvement at the site from 1942 —
1964, as historic documentation indicates that PCBs and mercury were ﬁrst used at the facility at a time of US. government
ownership for production of materials needed by the military. Pursuant to a Consent Decree entered on October 24, 2014, the
United States paid the Company $2.3 million in the 4th quarter of 2014 to resolve the Company’s claim for response costs for
investigation and initial remediation activities at this facility through October 24, 2014. Contribution by the United States to
any future costs of investigation or additional remediation has, by agreement, been left unresolved. Though the cost of the
likely remediation remains uncertain pending completion of the phased remediation decision process, we have estimated that
the Company’s share of the cost of the encapsulation and limited soil removal described above would approximate $0.4
million, which has been accrued as of December 31, 2016.
The Company is evaluating options for upgrading the wastewater treatment facilities at its Adams, Massachusetts plant.
This work has been undertaken pursuant to an administrative Consent Order originally issued by the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) on June 18, 2002. This order was amended on June 1, 2009 and on June 2,
2010. The amended Order includes the investigation by January 1, 2022 of options for ensuring that the facility's wastewater
treatment ponds will not result in unpermitted discharge to groundwater. Additional requirements of the amendment include
the submittal by July 1, 2022 of a plan for closure of a historic lime solids disposal area. Preliminary engineering reviews
completed in 2005 indicate that the estimated cost of wastewater treatment upgrades to operate this facility beyond 2024 may
be between $6 million and $8 million. The Company estimates that the remaining remediation costs would approximate $0.4
million, which has been accrued as of December 31, 2016.
The Company and its subsidiaries are not party to any other material pending legal proceedings, other than routine
litigation incidental to their businesses.
