In addition to FulFill®, MTI has launched its Neineld® PCC
platform of technologies that converts a papermakers’ waste
stream into a usable pigment. The waste stream in question
is predominantly in China where environmental regulations GROWTH THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES
prohibit burning or landﬁlling the material. Neineld® provides 2007'2016 New PIOduCt DeVelOPmem Plpelme
papermakers with a number of beneﬁts. It eliminates landﬁll costs, 245
provides an effective paper ﬁller and reduces emissions and energy ' '
costs. The company is also preparing to commercialize a new
application in the Neineld® platform that will help eliminate costs m
in the pulping process. The prospects for these new technologies
in China are bright. MTI is currently working with ﬁve papermakers
to adopt Neineld® and has identiﬁed 15 additional mills that
