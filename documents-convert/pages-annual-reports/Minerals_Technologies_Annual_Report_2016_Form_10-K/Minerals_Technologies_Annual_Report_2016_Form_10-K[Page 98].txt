Note 11. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
As a multinational corporation with operations throughout the world, the Company is exposed to certain market risks.
The Company uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including, when considered appropriate, derivative
ﬁnancial instruments. The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from interest rates and foreign currency
exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to hedge them. The Company uses derivative ﬁnancial
instruments only for risk management and not for trading or speculative purposes.
By using derivative ﬁnancial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies, the
Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform under
the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the
Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company
owes the counterparty, and therefore, it does not face any credit risk. The Company minimizes the credit risk in derivative
instruments by entering into transactions with major ﬁnancial institutions.
Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a ﬁnancial instrument that results from a change in interest rates, currency
exchange rates, or commodity prices. The market risk associated with interest rate and forward exchange contracts is
managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
Cash/low hedges:
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges, the Company records the effective portion
of the gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The
Company subsequently reclassiﬁes the effective portion of gain or loss into earnings in the period during which the hedged
transaction is recognized in earnings.
The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market ﬂuctuations on ﬂoating-rate debt. During the
second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a ﬂoating to ﬁxed interest rate swap for an initial aggregate notional
amount of $300 million. The notional amount at December 31, 2016 was $257 million. This interest rate swap is designated
as a cash ﬂow hedge. The gains and losses associated with this interest rate swap are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). The fair value of this swap was an asset of $2.5 million at December 31, 2016 and is recorded
in other assets and deferred charges on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In addition, the Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks
inherent in its forecasted inventory purchases. The Company had 2 open foreign exchange contracts as of December 31,
2016, designated as cash ﬂow hedges. The gains and losses associated with these forward exchange contracts are recognized
into cost of sales. Gains and losses and hedge ineffectiveness associated with these derivatives were not signiﬁcant. The fair
value of these contracts at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was not signiﬁcant.
