The Company has $34.6 million of deferred tax assets arising from tax loss carry forwards which will be realized through
future operations. Carry forwards of approximately $17.5 million expire over the next 20 years, and $17.1 million can be
utilized over an indeﬁnite period.
On December 31, 2016, the Company had $13.7 million of total unrecognized tax beneﬁts. Included in this amount were
a total of $9.5 million of unrecognized income tax beneﬁts that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate.
While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts will change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the
change to have a signiﬁcant impact on the results of operations or the ﬁnancial position of the Company.
