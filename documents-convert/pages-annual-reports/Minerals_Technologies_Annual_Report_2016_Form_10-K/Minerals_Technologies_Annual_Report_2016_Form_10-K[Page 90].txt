Note 4. Stock-Based Compensation
At the Company’s 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company’s stockholders ratiﬁed the adoption of the
Company’s 2015 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), which provides for grants of incentive and non-
qualiﬁed stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, stock awards or performance unit awards. The 2015 Plan
is substantially similar to the Company’s 2001 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (as amended and restated as of March 18,
2009, the “2001 Plan” and collectively with the 2015 Plan, the “Plans”). The Company established the 2015 Plan to increase
the total number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance by 880,000 shares from the number of shares
remaining under the 2001 Plan. With the ratification of the 2015 Plan by the Company’s stockholders, the 2001 Plan was
discontinued as to new grants (however, all awards previously granted under the 2001 Plan remained unchanged). The Plans
are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Stock options granted under the Plan generally
have a ten year term. The exercise price for stock options are at prices at or above the fair market value of the common stock
on the date of the grant, and each award of stock options will vest ratably over a speciﬁed period, generally three years.
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated financial statements for stock options based on the
grant date fair value.
Net income for years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014 include $3.5 million, $4.0 million and $3.1 million pre-tax
compensation costs, respectively, related to stock option expense as a component of marketing and administrative expenses.
