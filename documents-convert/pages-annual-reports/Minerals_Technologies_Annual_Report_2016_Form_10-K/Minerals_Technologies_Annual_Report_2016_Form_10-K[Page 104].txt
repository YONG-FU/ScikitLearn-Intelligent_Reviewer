The Company's funding policy for US. plans generally is to contribute annually into trust funds at a rate that provides for
future plan beneﬁts and maintains appropriate funded percentages. Annual contributions to the US. qualiﬁed plans are at
least sufﬁcient to satisfy regulatory funding standards and are not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax
purposes. The funding policies for the international plans conform to local governmental and tax requirements. The plans'
assets are invested primarily in stocks and bonds.
