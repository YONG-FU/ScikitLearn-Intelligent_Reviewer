The inclusion of excess tax beneﬁts and deﬁciencies as a component of our income tax expense will increase volatility within our provision for income
taxes as the amount of excess tax beneﬁts or deﬁciencies from stock-based compensation awards are dependent on our stock price at the date the awards vest.
Based on our current stock price, we would expect this change to have a material impact to our provision for income taxes. As a measure of sensitivity, had
we adopted this ASU at the beginning of 20 1 6, our income tax expense would have decreased by approximately $750 million, which reﬂects the amount of
excess tax beneﬁts generated during the year ended December 31, 2016.
In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax
consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the
income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact and expect the ASU will have a material impact on our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the statement of cash ﬂows. The new guidance requires
that restricted cash be included within cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash ﬂows. The ASU is effective retrospectively for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
Note 2—CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, US. and foreign government and
