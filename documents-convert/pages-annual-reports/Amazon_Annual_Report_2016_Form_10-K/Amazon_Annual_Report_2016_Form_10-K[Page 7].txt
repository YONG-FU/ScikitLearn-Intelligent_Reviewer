Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are signiﬁcant to our revenues and proﬁts, and we plan to ﬁthher expand internationally. In certain international market
segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not beneﬁt from any ﬁrst-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to
establish, develop, and maintain international operations and websites, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not be
proﬁtable on a sustained basis.
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
- local economic and political conditions;
- government regulation of e-commerce and other services, electronic devices, and competition, and restrictive governmental actions (such as trade
protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs), nationalization, and restrictions on foreign ownership;
- restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including
uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices
regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
- business licensing or certiﬁcation requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
- limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
- limited fulﬁllment and technology infrastructure;
- shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash ﬂow;
- laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or
discounts;
- lower levels of use of the Internet;
- lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
- lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
- difficulty in stafﬁng, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
- different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
