(Tieﬁgg—ibTe:8eT§:quired in 2014, 2015, and 2016 have estimated useful lives of between one and ﬁve years, one and six years, and one and seven
years, with weighted-average amortization periods of ﬁve years, ﬁve years, and ﬁve years.
The fair value of assumed stock options, estimated using the Black-Scholes model, and restricted stock units of $39 million, $9 million, and $0 million
for 2014, 2015, and 2016 will be expensed over the remaining service period. We determined the estimated fair value of identiﬁable intangible assets
acquired primarily by using the income approach. These assets are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized
to operating expenses on a straight—line basis over their estimated useﬁll lives.
Pro forma results of operations for 2016 have not been presented because the eﬁ‘ects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not
material to our consolidated results of operations.
