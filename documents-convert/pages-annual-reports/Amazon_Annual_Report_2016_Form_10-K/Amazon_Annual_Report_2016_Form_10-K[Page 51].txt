Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $3.6 billion, $4.9 billion, and $6.4 billion which includes amortization of property and
equipment acquired under capital leases of $ 1 .5 billion, $2.7 billion, and $3 .8 billion for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Gross assets recorded under capital leases
were $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Accumulated depreciation associated with capital leases was $5.4 billion and $8.5
billion as ofDecember 31, 2015 and 2016.
We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to—suit lease agreements Where we are considered the
owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which
do not qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these
buildings. This is principally due to our signiﬁcant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of
their useful lives or the related leases’ terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and ﬁnance leases provide purchase options. Upon
occupancy, the long-term construction obligations are considered long-term ﬁnance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months
recorded as “Accrued expenses and other.” Gross assets remaining under ﬁnance leases were $2.0 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
Accumulated depreciation associated with ﬁnance leases was $199 million and $361 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
Note 4—ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Acquisition Activity
On September 25, 2014, we acquired Twitch Interactive, Inc. (“Twitch”) for approximately $842 million in cash, as adjusted for the assumption of
options and other items. We acquired Twitch because of its user community and the live streaming experience it provides. During 2014, we acquired certain
other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. The primary reason for our other 2014 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-
how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.
During 2015 and 2016, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $690 million and $103 million. The primary reason for these
acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable
Amazon to serve customers more effectively.
Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not signiﬁcant.
