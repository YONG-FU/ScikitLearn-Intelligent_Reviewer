The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to signiﬁcant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results
and cash ﬂows for a particular period. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or
range of losses is not possible and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-
monetary remedies.
