Other Operating Expense, Net
Other operating expense, net was $133 million, $171 million, and $167 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016, and was primarily related to the
amortization of intangible assets.
Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was $39 million, $50 million, and $100 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016. We generally invest our excess cash in investment
grade short- to intermediate-term ﬁxed income securities and AAA—rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of
invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.
Interest expense was $210 million, $459 million, and $484 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term
debt and capital and ﬁnance lease arrangements.
Our long-term debt was $8.2 billion and $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. Our other long-term liabilities were $9.2 billion and $12.6
billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. See Item 8 of Part H, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5—Long-Term Debt and Note 6—
Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was $(1 18) million, $(25 6) million, and $90 million during 2014, 2015, and 2016. The primary component of other
income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant valuation gains (losses).
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is subject to signiﬁcant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the
mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments,
foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes
of expenses or losses for which tax beneﬁts are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax
income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.
We recorded a provision for income taxes of $167 million, $950 million, and $1.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Our provision for income taxes in
2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in US. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not
realize a tax beneﬁt. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax beneﬁt, primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income
without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded valuation allowances against the
deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax beneﬁt. We also generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily
related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.
Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in US. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the
proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax beneﬁt, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of
nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related
tax beneﬁt. We generated income and losses in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations.
We have tax beneﬁts relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce
our US. taxable income. In December 2015, US. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through
2019 and made permanent the US. federal research and development credit. As of December 31, 2016, our federal net operating loss carryforward was
approximately $76 million and we had approximately $608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax
credits are primarily related to the US. federal research and development credit.
