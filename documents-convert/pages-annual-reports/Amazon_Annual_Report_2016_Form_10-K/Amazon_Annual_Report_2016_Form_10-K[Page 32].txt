Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency ﬂuctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.
Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part H, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is
carried at amortized cost and ﬂuctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which
pays interest at a ﬁxed rate, will generally ﬂuctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in
periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable ﬁxed income securities are designated as available-for—sale and, accordingly,
are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term ﬁxed
income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest
rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.
The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable ﬁxed income securities, including principal cash ﬂows by
expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2016 (in millions, except percentages):
