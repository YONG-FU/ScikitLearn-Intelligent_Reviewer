compensation are accounted for as an increase to additional paid-in capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable.
T ax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the US. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant judgment is required in evaluating our tax
positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional
taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions
are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes
includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):

(ITEE‘EEETQT 3:71:30 1 6, we had $1.7 billion of accrued tax contingencies, of which $1.1 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax
rate.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax beneﬁt, related to tax contingencies of $59 million
and $67 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax beneﬁt, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016 was $8 million,
$18 million, and $9 million.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2005 and thereafter. These
examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under
examination as well as subsequent periods. As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for transactions
undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our US. taxable
income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion, subject to interest. To date, we have not resolved this matter
administratively and are currently contesting it in US. Tax Court. We continue to disagree with these IRS positions and intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in this matter. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were
to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to signiﬁcant additional tax liabilities.
Certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration
(“PTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes. In
September 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign
jurisdictions. In June 2015, we received ﬁnal tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French tax of €1 96 million, including interest and
penalties through September 2012. We disagree with the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously. We plan to pursue all available administrative
remedies, and if we are not able to resolve this matter, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2006 through
2010, if this litigation is adversely determined or if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to
signiﬁcant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by
the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.
If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and
prior periods from 2003 onwards and our taxes in the future could increase. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions
including Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and
additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter.
