Free Cash Flow Less Finance Lease Principal Repayments and Assets Acquired Under Capital Leases
Free cash ﬂow less ﬁnance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash ﬂow reduced by “Principal repayments of
ﬁnance lease obligations,” which are included in cash ﬂow from ﬁnancing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this
measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reﬂected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these
assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow less ﬁnance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases to
the most comparable GAAP cash ﬂow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2014 2015 2016
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 6,842 $ 11,920 $ 16,443 l
Purchases of property and equipment, including intemal—use software and website development,
net (4,893) (4,589) (6,737)
lProperty and equ_ipment acquired under capital leases (4,008) (4,717) (5,704) l
Principal repayments of ﬁnance lease obligations (13 5) (121) (147)
’Free cash ﬂow less ﬁnance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases $ (2,194) $ 2,493 $ 3,855 l
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (5,065) $ (6,450) $ (9,876) l
Net cash provided by (used in) ﬁnancing activities $ 4,432 $ (3,763) $ (2,911)
All of these free cash ﬂows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash ﬂow statement and do not represent the
residual cash ﬂow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash ﬂows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash
or other ﬁnancing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash ﬂows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash ﬂows.
Eﬂect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the US. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is
provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.
The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is as follows (in millions):
