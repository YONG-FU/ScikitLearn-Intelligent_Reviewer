Note 5—LONG-TERM DEBT
In November 2012 and December 2014, we issued $3.0 billion and $6.0 billion of unsecured senior notes, of which $8.3 billion is outstanding, as
described in the table below (collectively, the “Notes”). As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, the unamortized discount on the Notes was $97 million and $90
million. We also have other long-term debt with a carrying amount, including the current portion and borrowings on our credit facility, of $3 12 million and
$5 88 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. The face value of our total long-term debt obligations is as follows (in millions):

(2) Issued in December 2014, effective interest rates ofthe 2019, 2021, 2024, 2034, and 2044 Notes were 2.73%, 3.43%, 3.90%, 4.92%, and 5.11%.
Interest on the Notes issued in 2012 is payable semi—annually in arrears in May and November. Interest on the Notes issued in 2014 is payable semi-
annually in arrears in June and December. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at speciﬁed redemption prices. We are
not subject to any ﬁnancial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the Notes are used for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the
Notes was approximately $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, which is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of
those dates.
In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a lender that is secured by certain seller
receivables. The Credit Facility is available for a term of three years, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.65%, and has a
commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There was $495 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016,
which had a weighted—average interest rate of 2.3% as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we have pledged $579 million of our cash and seller
receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated
its carrying value as of December 31, 2016.
The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.7% and 3.4% as of December 31, 2015 and 2016. We used the
net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain international operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is
based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
