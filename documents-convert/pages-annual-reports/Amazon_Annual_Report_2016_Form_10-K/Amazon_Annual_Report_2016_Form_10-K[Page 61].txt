Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 483 million, 490 million, and 497 million, as of December 31,
2014, 2015, and 2016. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.

In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5 .0 billion of our common stock, with no ﬁxed expiration. This
stock repurchase authorization replaced the previous $2.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2010. There were no
repurchases of common stock in 2014, 2015, or 2016.

Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards and stock options over the corresponding service term, generally between two and ﬁve years.
