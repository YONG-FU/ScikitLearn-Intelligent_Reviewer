In May 2016, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders that provides us with a
borrowing capacity of up to $3 .0 billion. This Credit Agreement replaces the prior credit agreement entered into in September 2014. The Credit Agreement
has a term of three years, but it may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The initial interest rate applicable to
outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.60%, with a commitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility, under
our current credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded these rates could increase to as much as LIBOR plus 1.00% and 0.09%, respectively. There were
no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
