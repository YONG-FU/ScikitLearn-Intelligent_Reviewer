We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, our product
mix shifts to the electronics and other general merchandise category, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer
additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our ﬁllﬁllment network,
negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating eﬁiciencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is ﬁlndamental to
our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.
