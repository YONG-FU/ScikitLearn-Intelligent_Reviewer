Results of Operations
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-
based compensation and “Other operating expense, net” to our segment results, and we conformed prior period segment results to the current presentation.
These segments reﬂect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part H, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data—Note 11—Segment Information.”
Net Sales
Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media
content where we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales,
certain digital content subscriptions, certain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated
between product sales and service sales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services. Net sales information is
