Equity—Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax
Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $37 million, $(22) million, and $(96) million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The primary component of
this activity during 2014 was our share of a gain recorded by LivingSocial related to the sale of its Korean operations. This gain was partially offset by
operating losses incurred by LivingSocial during the period. The primary components of this activity during 2015 and 2016 were our equity-method
investment losses during the periods and impairments recorded in 2016.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations deﬁne and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP ﬁnancial information. Our measures of free cash ﬂows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations, meet
the deﬁnition of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash ﬂows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through capital and ﬁnance leases.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash ﬂow is cash ﬂow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including intemal-use software and website
development, net,” which is included in cash ﬂow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow to the most comparable GAAP
cash ﬂow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions):

Net cash provided by (used in) ﬁnancing activities $ 4,432 $ (3,763) $ (2,911)
Free Cash Flow Less Lease Principal Repayments
Free cash ﬂow less lease principal repayments is free cash ﬂow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal
repayments of ﬁnance lease obligations,” which are included in cash ﬂow from ﬁnancing activities. Free cash ﬂow less lease principal repayments
approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and ﬁnance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow less lease principal repayments
to the most comparable GAAP cash ﬂow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2014, 2015, and 2016 (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2014 _ 2015 _ 2016
