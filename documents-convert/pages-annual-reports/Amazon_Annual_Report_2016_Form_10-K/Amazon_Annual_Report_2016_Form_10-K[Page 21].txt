Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash ﬂow information is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2014 _ 2015 _ 2016
{Cash provided by (used in): l
Operating activities $ 6,842 $ 11,920 $ 16,443
1 Investing activities (5,065) (6,450) (9,876) l
Financing activities 4,432 (3 ,7 63) (2,91 1)
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash ﬂows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at
fair value, were $17.4 billion, $19.8 billion, and $26.0 billion as of December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5 .4
billion, $7.3 billion, and $9.1 billion, as of December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $6.8 billion, $11.9 billion, and $16.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Our operating cash ﬂows
result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-
branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to
intemal—use software that are reﬂected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest
payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers
primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash ﬂow in 2015, compared to the
comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-
based compensation, and changes in working capital. The increase in operating cash ﬂow in 2016, compared to the comparable prior yearperiod, was
primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non—cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by
(used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any speciﬁc point in time is subject to many variables,
including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and ﬂuctuations in
foreign exchange rates.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, intemal—use software
and website development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and
maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(5.1) billion, $(6.5) billion, and $(9.9) billion in 2014, 2015, and
2016, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable
securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $4.9 billion, $4.6 billion, and $6.7 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016,
which primarily reﬂect additional capacity to support our fulﬁllment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to
investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three periods. Capital expenditures included $537 million,
$528 million, and $417 million for intemal-use software and website development in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Stock-based compensation capitalized for
intemal—use software and website development costs does not affect cash ﬂows. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we made cash payments, net of acquired cash,
related to acquisition and other investment activity of $979 million, $795 million, and $116 million.
Cash provided by (used in) ﬁnancing activities was $4.4 billion, $(3 .8) billion, and $(2.9) billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Cash outﬂows from
ﬁnancing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and ﬁnance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other.
Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and ﬁnance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $1.9 billion, $4.2 billion,
and $4.4 billion in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The increase in 2015 primarily reﬂects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a $750 million repayment
on our unsecured senior notes. Property and equipment acquired under capital leases were $4.0 billion, $4.7 billion, and $5.7 billion in 2014, 2015, and
2016, with the increase reﬂecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS,
which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inﬂows from ﬁnancing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and
tax beneﬁts relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $6.4 billion, $353 million, and $621
million in 2014,
