Note 10—INCONIE TAXES
In 2014, 2015, and 2016, we recorded net tax provisions of $ 1 67 million, $950 million, and $1.4 billion. We have tax beneﬁts relating to excess stock-
based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our US. taxable income. In December 2015, US.
legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019 and made permanent the US. federal
research and development credit. As such, cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $177 million, $273 million, and $412 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016.

Our provision for income taxes in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to an increase in US. pre-tax income and increased losses in certain
foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax beneﬁt. Losses for which we may not realize a related tax beneﬁt, primarily due to losses of foreign
subsidiaries, reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We have recorded
valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax beneﬁt. We also generated income in
lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.
Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in US. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in
the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax beneﬁt, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of
nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances
