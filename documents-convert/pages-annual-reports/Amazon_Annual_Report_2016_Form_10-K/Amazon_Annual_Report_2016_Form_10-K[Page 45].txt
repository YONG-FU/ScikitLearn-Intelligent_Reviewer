For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market ﬁmds and equity securities based on quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. All other ﬁnancial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or
based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other signiﬁcant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold
any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
As part of entering into commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of
December 31, 2015 and 2016, these warrants had a fair value of $ 1 6 million and $223 million, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated
balance sheets. The related gain (loss) recorded in “Other income (expense), net” was $(5) million, $0 million, and $67 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016.
These assets are primarily classiﬁed as Level 2 assets.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost
or market value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as
through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.
We provide Fulﬁllment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their
inventory, regardless of whether ﬁilﬁllment is provided by us or the third—party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.
We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services
for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter
into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of ﬁrm,
non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. Ifwe reduce these commitments, we may incur additional
costs.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, sellers, and vendors.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, customer receivables, net, were $2.3 billion and $3.9 billion, seller receivables, net, were $337 million and $661 million,
and vendor receivables, net, were $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which
provides ﬁnding to sellers primarily to procure inventory.
We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired
and written—off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for
doubtful accounts was $190 million, $189 million, and $237 million as of December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016. Additions to the allowance were $225
million, $289 million, and $451 million, and deductions to the allowance were $188 million, $290 million, and $403 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The
allowance for loan losses related to our seller receivables was not material as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
Internal-Use Software and Website Development
Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useﬁil life of the software. Costs
related to design or maintenance of intemal—use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended 2014, 2015, and 2016, we
capitalized $641 million (including $104 million of stock-based compensation), $642 million (including $114 million of stock-based compensation), and
$511 million (including $94 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with intemal-use software and website development. Amortization of
previously capitalized amounts was $559 million, $635 million, and $634 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we
have acquired under build-to-suit, ﬁnance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as ﬁlmiture and ﬁxtures, heavy equipment, servers
and networking equipment, and internal—use software and
