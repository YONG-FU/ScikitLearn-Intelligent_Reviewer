Pledged Assets
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $418 million and $715 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt relating to certain international
operations, real estate leases, and amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions.
Suppliers
During 2016, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors
to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.
Other Contingencies
In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by
the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books,
music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, ofﬁce, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive
products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control
and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate ﬁilly with OFAC and BIS
