° Restructuring charges —- We have incurred restructuring charges that are included in our GAAP financial statements,
primarily related to workforce reductions and estimated costs of exiting facility lease commitments. We exclude these
items from our non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items
vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reﬂect expected future operating
expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or
historical operations of our business.
- Beneﬁt from adoption of software development activities —- In 2014, we recognized a benefit to non-income related
tax expense associated with the adoption of software development activities. We exclude this item from our non—
GAAP financial measures because transactions of this nature occur infrequently and are not considered part of our core
business operations.
- Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and amortization of capitalized interest expense — In February
2014, we issued $690 million of convertible senior notes due 2019 with a coupon interest rate of 0%. The imputed
interest rate of the convertible senior notes was approximately 3.2%. This is a result of the debt discount recorded for
the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity under GAAP, thereby reducing the
carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the
issuance costs of the debt. All of our interest expense is comprised of these non-cash components and is excluded from
management's assessment of our operating performance because management believes the non-cash expense is not
representative of ongoing operating performance.
° Gains and losses on investments — We have recorded gains and losses from the disposition and impairment of certain
investments. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the
types of events giving rise to them occur infrequently and are not representative of our core business operations and
ongoing operating performance.
0 Legal matter costs — We have incurred losses from the settlement of legal matters and costs with respect to our
internal US. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation in addition to the disgorgement we were required to pay to
resolve it. We believe excluding these amounts from our non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as the
types of events giving rise to them are not representative of our core business operations.
0 Income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items — The non-GAAP adjustments
described above are reported on a pre-tax basis. The income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments is the difference
between GAAP and non-GAAP income tax expense. Non-GAAP income tax expense is computed on non-GAAP pre-
tax income (GAAP pre-tax income adjusted for non-GAAP adjustments) and excludes certain discrete tax items (such
as recording or releasing of valuation allowances), if any. We believe that applying the non-GAAP adjustments and
their related income tax effect allows us to highlight income attributable to our core operations.
