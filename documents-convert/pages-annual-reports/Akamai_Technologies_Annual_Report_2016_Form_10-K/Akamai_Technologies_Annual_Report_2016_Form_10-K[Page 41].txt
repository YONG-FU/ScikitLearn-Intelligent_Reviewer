Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of debt and equity securities and cash
generated by operations. As of December 31, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which primarily
consisted of corporate bonds and US. government agency securities, totaled $1.6 billion. Factoring in our convertible senior
notes of $690.0 million, our net cash at December 31, 2016 was $926.3 million. We place our cash investments in instruments
that meet high-quality credit standards, as specified in our investment policy. Our investment policy also limits the amount of
our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and
maintaining adequate liquidity at all times.
Changes in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in, among other things, working
capital items such as deferred revenues, accounts payable, accounts receivable and various accrued expenses, as well as
changes in our capital and financial structure due to common stock repurchases, debt repurchases and issuances, stock option
exercises, purchases and sales of marketable securities and similar events. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash
position are important competitive differentiators that provide the financial ﬂexibility necessary to make investments at
opportune times. We expect to continue to evaluate strategic investments to strengthen our business on an ongoing basis.
As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $228.0 million held in accounts outside the US. An
immaterial amount of these funds would be subject to US. federal taxation if repatriated, with such tax liability partially offset
by foreign tax credits. The remainder of our cash and cash equivalents held outside the US. are subject to, or offset by,
intercompany obligations to our parent company in the US. and, therefore, are not subject to US. federal taxation. As a result,
our liquidity is not materially impacted by the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts outside the US.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher cash
collection from customers due to increased revenue, and lower commissions and annual bonus payments due to lower award
attainment levels. These increases to cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by higher cash paid for taxes
during 2016, as compared to 2015. Accounts receivable days outstanding was 54 days as of the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to 59 days as of the year ended December 31, 2015.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015 as compared to 20 14, was primarily due to the decrease in
cash paid for income taxes of $75.0 million versus $166.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The increase is also due to an increase in cash collections from customers as a result of increased revenue, offset
by the increase in operating expenditures and the overall timing of our working capital payments. Accounts receivable days
outstanding was 59 days as of the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 56 days as of the year ended December 31,
2O 14.
