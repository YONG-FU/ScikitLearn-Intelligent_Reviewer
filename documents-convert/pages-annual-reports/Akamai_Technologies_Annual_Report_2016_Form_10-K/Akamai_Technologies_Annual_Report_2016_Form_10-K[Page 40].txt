We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be another important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our
business and a good measure of our historical operating trends. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that are either not part of
our core operations or are non-cash in nature. We define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net income excluding the following items:
interest income; income taxes; depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets; stock-based compensation;
amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation; acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges; benefit from adoption of
software development activities; gains and other activity related to divestiture of a business; gains and losses on legal
settlements; costs incurred with respect to our internal FCPA investigation; foreign exchange gains and losses; loss on early
extinguishment of debt; amortization of debt discount and issuance costs; amortization of capitalized interest expense; certain
gains and losses on investments; and other non-recurring or unusual items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA
margin represents Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of revenue.
The following table reconciles GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Revenue and earnings from our international operations have historically been an important contributor to our financial
results. Consequently, our financial results have been impacted, and management expects they will continue to be impacted, by
ï¬‚uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, when the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries weaken,
generally our consolidated results stated in US. dollars are negatively impacted.
Because exchange rates are a meaningful factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, management believes the
presentation of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and earnings enhances the understanding of our
financial results and evaluation of performance in comparison to prior periods. The dollar impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates presented is calculated by translating current period results using monthly average foreign currency exchange
rates from the comparative period and comparing them to the reported amount. The percentage change at constant currency
presented is calculated by comparing the prior period amounts as reported and the current period amounts translated using the
same monthly average foreign currency exchange rates from the comparative period.
