December 31,
7 2016 7
IRSUS with service-based vesting conditions 7 3,873 7
RSUS with market-based vesting conditions 127
IRSUS with performance-based vesting conditions 116 I
Total 7 4,116 7
RSUs represent the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. RSUs are granted at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or, subject to defined limitations, the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company, acting as a committee of one director, to whom such authority has been delegated. The Company has issued RSUs
that vest based on the passage of time assuming continued service with the Company, RSUS that vest only upon the
achievement of defined performance metrics tied primarily to revenue and income targets and other key financial performance
indicators and RSUs that vest based upon total shareholder return ("TSR") measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer
group.
For RSUs with service-based vesting conditions, the fair value is calculated based upon the Company’s closing stock price
on the date of grant, and the stock-based compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting period. Most RSUs with
service-based vesting provisions vest in installments over a three- or four-year period following the grant date.
Beginning in the first quarter of 20 16, the Company granted RSUs with market-based vesting conditions to certain of its
executive officers. The Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the Company’s RSUs
based on TSR. This model requires the input of assumptions, including the estimated term of each award, the risk-free interest
rate, historical stock price volatility of the Company's shares and historical stock price volatility of peer-company shares. The
grant-date fair values of the Company's RSUS with market-based vesting conditions granted during the year ended December
31, 2016 were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:
20 l 6
Expected term (in years) 7 3.0 7
Risk-free interest rate 0. 8%-
'Akamai historical share price volatility 34.3%-
Average volatility of peer-company share price 276%-
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, management measured compensation expense for performance-
based RSUs based upon a review of the Company’s expected achievement against specified financial performance targets. Such
compensation cost is being recorded using a graded-vesting method for each series of grants of performance-based RSUs, to
the extent management has deemed that such awards are probable of vesting based upon the expected achievement against the
specified targets. On a periodic basis, management reviews the Company’s expected performance and adjusts the compensation
cost, if needed, at such time.
