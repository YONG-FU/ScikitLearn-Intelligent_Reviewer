When developing fair value estimates, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to measure fair value. The valuation technique
used to measure fair value for the Company's Level 1 and Level 2 assets is a market approach, using prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. If market prices are not available, the
fair value measurement is based on models that use primarily market-based parameters including yield curves, volatilities,
credit ratings and currency rates. In certain cases where market rate assumptions are not available, the Company is required to
make judgments about assumptions market participants would use to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument.
The valuation technique used to measure fair value of the Company's Level 3 liabilities, which consists of contingent
consideration related to the acquisitions of Soha Systems, Inc. ("Soha") and Cyberfend, Inc. ("Cyberfend") in 2016 (Note 8),
was primarily an income approach. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the contingent
consideration is the likelihood of achieving development milestones to integrate the acquired technology into the Company's
technology as well as achieving certain post-closing financial results.
