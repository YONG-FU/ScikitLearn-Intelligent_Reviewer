In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance that is intended to simplify aspects of how share-based payments are accounted
for and presented in financial statements. This guidance requires that entities record all tax effects of share-based payments at
settlement or expiration through the income statement. The standard also amends how windfall tax benefits are recognized, the
minimum statutory tax withholding requirements and how entities elect to recognize share-based payment forfeitures. In addition,
this guidance impacts the presentation of cash flows related to excess tax benefits by no longer requiring separate presentation as
a financing activity apart from other operating income tax cash ﬂows. This guidance was effective for the Company beginning on
January 1, 2017. Upon adoption on a prospective basis, the Company is recognizing excess tax benefits in its provision for
income taxes rather than as additional paid—in capital. In addition, the Company expects to adopt the presentation requirements
related to the excess tax benefit in its cash ﬂows on a retrospective basis, which will result in an increase to cash ﬂows from
operating activities of $5.5 million and $29.3 million with a corresponding decrease to cash ﬂows from financing activities for the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Finally, the Company expects to continue estimating forfeitures in
determining the amount of compensation cost.
In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial
instruments, including available—for-sale debt securities. The guidance establishes a new "expected loss model" that requires
entities to estimate current expected credit losses on financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. Any
expected credit losses are to be reﬂected as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of available-for-sale debt
securities. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The Company is evaluating the potential impact
of adopting this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra—
entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This guidance will be effective for the Company on
January 1, 2018 and is to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a recognizing cumulative-effect adjustment as a
component of equity as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new accounting
guidance on its consolidated financial statements.
