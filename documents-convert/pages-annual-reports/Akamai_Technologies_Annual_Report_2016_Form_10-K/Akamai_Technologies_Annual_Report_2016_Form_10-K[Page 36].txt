For the year ended December 31, 2016, the effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to
the composition of income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the US,
the domestic production activities deduction and the US. federal, state and foreign research and development credits, partially
offset by the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share-based
payments and state income taxes.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate due to
the retroactive application of a US. tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation in intercompany
arrangements, the federal research and development credit, the domestic production activities deduction and the composition of
income from foreign jurisdictions that is taxed at lower rates compared to the statutory tax rates in the US. These benefits
were partially offset by the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance
for share-based payments and state income taxes.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, our effective income tax rate was lower than the federal statutory tax rate mainly
due to the federal research and development credit, a state tax benefit from software development activities, the domestic
production activities deduction and the composition of income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates, partially offset by
state income taxes and the effects of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance for
share-based payments.
The increase in the provision for income taxes for 2016 as compared to 2015 was mainly due to the retroactive application
of a US. tax court ruling with respect to the treatment of stock-based compensation on intercompany arrangements which
occurred in 2015, a decrease in the US. federal and state research and development credits and a change in the composition of
income from foreign jurisdictions. This increase in the provision for income taxes was partially offset by an increase in the
domestic production activities deduction.
