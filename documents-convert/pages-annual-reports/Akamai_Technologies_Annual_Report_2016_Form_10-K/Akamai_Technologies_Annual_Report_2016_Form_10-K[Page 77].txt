The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the Company’s stock option
awards. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and the estimated
term of each award. The estimated fair value of the Company's stock-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over
the awards’ vesting period on a straight-line basis. Expected volatilities are based on the Company’s historical stock price
volatility and implied volatility from traded options in its stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate the expected term
of options granted within the valuation model. The risk-free interest rate for periods commensurate with the expected term of
the option is based on the US. Treasury yield rate in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is zero, as the
Company currently does not pay a dividend and does not anticipate doing so in the future.
The Company did not grant any stock options during 2016 or 2015. The grant-date fair values of the Company's stock
