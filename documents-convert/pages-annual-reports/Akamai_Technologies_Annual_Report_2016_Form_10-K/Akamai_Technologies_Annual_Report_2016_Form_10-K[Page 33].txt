The increase in total cost of revenue for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in:
- amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network;
- amounts paid for network build-out and supporting services related to the increase in server deployments and
investments in network expansion;
- payroll and related costs of service personnel due to more hiring in our services and network operations organizations
to support revenue growth; and
- depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our
infrastructure and release internally developed software onto our network.
We have long-term purchase commitments for co—location services and bandwidth usage with various vendors and network
and Internet service providers. Our minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co-location services may vary from
period to period depending on the timing and length of contract renewals with our service providers. See Note 11 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for details regarding our bandwidth
usage and co—location services purchase commitments.
We believe that cost of revenue will increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher bandwidth expenses
associated with increased customer traffic on our network and the costs of efforts to increase our network's capacity and
resiliency to combat potential attacks on our platform. Additionally, during 2017, we anticipate amortization of intemal-use
software development costs to increase as compared to 2016, along with increased payroll and related costs associated with our
professional services personnel and related expenses. We plan to continue making investments in our network with the
expectation that our customer base will continue to expand and that we will continue to deliver more traffic to existing
customers.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):

The increases in research and development expenses for 2016 as compared to 2015, and 2015 as compared to 2014, were
due to increases in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth to support investments in new product development
and network scaling, partially offset by increases in capitalized salaries and related costs.
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, other than certain internal-use software development costs
eligible for capitalization. Capitalized development costs consist of payroll and related costs for personnel and external
consulting expenses involved in the development of intemal-use software used to deliver our services and operate our network.
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $21.4 million, $16.7 million and $13.7 million,
respectively, of stock-based compensation. These capitalized intemal-use software development costs are amortized to cost of
revenue over their estimated useful lives, which is generally two years.
We believe that research and development expenses during 2017 will increase as compared to 2016, as we expect to
continue to increase the number of development personnel, through hiring or acquisition activity, in order to make
improvements to our core technology and support engineering innovation and the development of new services.
