The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by net marketable securities
activity which was a net outﬂow for the year. Our excess cash as well as the proceeds from sales and maturities of our
marketable securities were reinvested, as compared to 2015, where we did not reinvest a portion of our proceeds in order to
fund acquisitions. This outﬂow is partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during 2016, as
compared 2015, as we moderated investment in our network. Additionally, acquisitions during 2016 were of a smaller
magnitude than those during 2015.
The decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2015 partially relates to the acquisition of ProleXic during 2014, with no
corresponding acquisition of the same magnitude during 2015. Net marketable securities activity also contributed to the
decrease in cash used in investing activities. During 2014, we invested the proceeds from our convertible senior notes, which
caused the activity for marketable securities to be a net outﬂow. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially
offset by an increase of purchases of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software during 2015, as compared to
2014, as we continued to invest in our network with the goal of enhancing and adding functionality to our service offerings.

The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2016 as compared to 2015, was primarily the result of increased
share repurchases. In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective
from October 16, 2013 through December 31, 2016. In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share
repurchase program that superseded the October 2013 repurchase program and became effective in February 2016 through
December 31, 2018. The Company's goal for the share repurchase program is to offset the dilution created by its employee
equity compensation programs and provide the ﬂexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions
warrant.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 7.0 million, 4.5 million and 4.6 million shares of our common stock,
respectively, at an average price per share of $53.28, $67.05 and $58.02, respectively.
The decrease in cash from financing activities during 2015 as compared to 2014, was primarily the result of the convertible
senior notes issued in February 2014 and related note hedge and warrant transactions. During 2015, we also increased our
repurchases of common stock.
