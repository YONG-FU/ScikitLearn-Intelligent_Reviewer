The aggregate intrinsic value in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the Company’s
closing stock price of $66.68 on December 31, 2016, that would have been received by the option holders had all option
holders exercised their “in-the-money” options as of that date. The total number of shares issuable upon the exercise of “in-the-
money” options exercisable as of December 31, 2016 was 0.8 million.
Deferred Stock Units
The Company has granted deferred stock units ("DSUS") to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. Each DSU
represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The holder may elect to defer receipt of
the vested shares of stock represented by the DSU for a period of at least one year but not more than ten years from the grant
date. For those granted prior to 2014, DSUS vested 50% upon the first anniversary of the grant date, with the remaining 50%
vesting in equal installments of 12.5% each quarter thereafter such that all DSUS vested in full at the end of two years from
date of grant. Beginning in 2014, DSUs vest 100% on the first anniversary of the grant date. If a director has completed one
year of Board service, vesting of 100% of the DSUs held by such director will accelerate at the time of his or her departure
from the Board.
The following table summarizes the DSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2016:

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of DSUS that were vested and distributed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014 was $1.4 million, $10.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The total fair value of DSUs that were vested and
distributed during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.6 million, $4.9 million and $0.8 million,
respectively. The grant-date fair value is calculated based upon the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant. As of
December 31, 2016, 46,000 DSUS were unvested, with an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $3.1 million and a
weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 0.4 years. These units are expected to vest in May 2017.
