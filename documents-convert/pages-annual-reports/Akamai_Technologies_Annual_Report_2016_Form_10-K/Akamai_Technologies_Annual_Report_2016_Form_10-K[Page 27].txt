The following items impact the comparability of the consolidated financial data presented above:
- During the years presented in the table above, various acquisitions occurred, the results of which are presented
prospectively from the date of acquisition. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this annual report on Form 10—K for more details regarding these acquisitions.
- Effective January 1, 2013, we increased the expected average useful lives of our network assets, primarily servers,
from three to four years to reﬂect software and hardware related initiatives to manage our global network more
efficiently. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, this change decreased depreciation expense
on network assets as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The change increased net income and both basic
and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 as compared to the
year ended December 31, 2012.
