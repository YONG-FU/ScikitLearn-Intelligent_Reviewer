The increase in total cost of revenue for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in:
- amounts paid to network providers for bandwidth fees to support the increase in traffic served on our network and for
traffic served from higher cost regions;
- payroll and related costs, as well as stock-based compensation, due to more hiring in our services to support revenue
growth, and
- depreciation of network equipment and amortization of internal-use software as we continued to invest in our
infrastructure and release intemally-developed software onto our network.
