Non-GAAP net income per diluted share is calculated as non-GAAP net income divided by diluted weighted average
common shares outstanding. GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding are adjusted in non-GAAP per share
calculations for the shares that would be delivered to us pursuant to the note hedge transactions entered into in connection with
the issuance of our convertible senior notes. Under GAAP, shares delivered under hedge transactions are not considered
offsetting shares in the fully-diluted share calculation until they are delivered. However, we would receive a benefit from the
note hedge transactions and would not allow the dilution to occur, so management believes that adjusting for this benefit
provides a meaningful view of net income per share. Unless and until our weighted average stock price is greater than $89.56,
the initial conversion price, there will be no difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP diluted weighted average common
shares outstanding.
