The increase in total general and administrative expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in:
- expansion of company infrastructure throughout 2015 to support investments in engineering, go-to market
capacity and enterprise expansion initiatives, particularly expansion of our general and administrative headcount and
our facility footprint, which increased payroll and related costs, facilities-related costs and depreciation and
amortization; and
- increases in the number of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions that we use, as compared to 2014, which
contributed to the increase in professional fees and other expenses, along with increases in legal and other professional
consulting fees.
During 2017, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as compared to 2016, due to anticipated increased
payroll and related costs and facilities-related costs. The increase in those expenses is expected to be attributable to increased
hiring, investments in information technology and the expansion of our facility footprint to support headcount growth, which
occurred throughout 2016 and is expected to continue in 2017.

The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2016, as compared to 2015, was attributable to the
finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in previous years; partially offset by acquired intangible asset
amortization acquired in 2015 and 2016. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets in 2015, as compared to
2014, was driven by the finalization of amortization of intangible assets acquired in earlier years, in addition to the deceleration
in recognition of customer backlog-related intangible assets acquired from Prolexic, which had a short useful life.
Based on acquired intangible assets at December 31, 2016, future amortization is expected to be approximately $29.2
million, $26.4 million, $25.0 million, $21.1 million and $16.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019,
2020 and 2021, respectively.

The restructuring charges in 2016 were primarily the result of changes to our organizational structure to reorganize our
products and development groups and global sales, services and marketing teams into divisions centered on our solutions. The
restructuring charges relate to severance expenses for impacted employees and charges for internal-use software not yet placed
into service that will not be completed and launched due to changing priorities as part of the reorganization. The restructuring
charges in 2015 and 2014 consisted of severance expenses for redundant employees associated with acquisitions completed
during those years. We do not expect to continue to incur significant restructuring charges as a result of any of these actions.
