Convertible Senior Notes
In February 2014, we issued $690.0 million in par value of convertible senior notes due 2019 and entered into related
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions. The terms of the notes, hedge and warrant transactions are discussed more
fully in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10—K. We have used,
and intend to use, the net proceeds of the offering for share repurchases, working capital and general corporate purposes,
including potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
Liquidity Outlook
We believe, based on our present business plan, that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances
and our forecasted cash ﬂows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next 12
months. Our foreseeable cash needs, in addition to our recurring operating costs, include our expected capital expenditures,
investments in information technology and facility expansion, opportunistic business acquisitions, anticipated share
repurchases, lease and purchase commitments and settlements of other long-term liabilities.
Contractual Obligations, Contingent Liabilities and Commercial Commitments
The following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2016, for the

In accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of December 31, 2016, we
had unrecognized tax benefits of $77.1 million, including $13.7 million of accrued interest and penalties. We believe that it is
reasonably possible that $15.8 million of our unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized by the end of 20 17. The settlement
period for the remaining amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is unknown.
Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding $6.8 million in irrevocable letters of credit issued by us in favor of third
party beneficiaries, primarily related to facility leases. These irrevocable letters of credit, which are not included in the table of
contractual obligations above, are unsecured and are expected to remain in effect, in some cases, until 2028.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have entered into indemnification agreements with third parties, including vendors, customers, landlords, our officers
and directors, shareholders of acquired companies, joint venture partners and third parties to which we license technology.
Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by a third party due to various events, such
as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement or our negligence. These indemnification obligations are considered
off-balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for guarantor’s accounting and disclosure
requirements for guarantees, including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these indemnification agreements.
The fair value of guarantees issued or modified during 2016 and 2015 was determined to be immaterial.
