results of operations, financial condition or cash ﬂows.
In 2016, the Company completed an internal investigation, with the assistance of outside counsel, relating to improper
sales practices by a former employee. The internal investigation included a review of compliance with the requirements of the
US. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws and regulations. In February 2015, the Company voluntarily
contacted the Commission and Department of Justice to advise both agencies of this internal investigation. In June 2016, the
Company signed a non-prosecution agreement with the Commission and agreed to disgorge $0.7 million to resolve this matter,
including interest.
In July 2016, as part of the resolution of a patent infringement lawsuit filed by the Company against Limelight Networks,
Inc. (“Limelight”) in 2006, the Company agreed to license to Limelight technology covered by certain of the Company’s
patents. The terms of the agreement require Limelight to pay the Company $54.0 million in 12 equal installments over three
years, beginning in August 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company received $9.0 million under this
agreement, which was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income,
with $0.4 million recorded as interest income.
In November 2015, Limelight filed a complaint in the US. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the
Company and X0 Communications LLC (“X0”), alleging patent infringement by the two companies. The complaint alleges
that the Company and X0 infringed siX of Limelight’s content delivery patents. The complaint seeks to recover from the
Company and X0 monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to infringing technology used by the companies. The
Company has agreed to indemnify XO for damages it incurs in this matter. The Company has made counterclaims in the action
against Limelight alleging that Limelight has infringed five of the Company’s content delivery patents, and the Company is
seeking monetary damages based upon lost revenue due to the infringing technology used by Limelight. The case is scheduled
for trial in May 2017. No provision with respect to this matter has been made in the Company ’s consolidated financial
statements. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.
