Our Technology and Network
The Akamai Intelligent Platform leverages more than 200,000 servers deployed in approximately 1,600 networks ranging
from large, backbone network providers to medium and small Internet service providers, or ISPs, to cable modem and satellite
providers to universities and other networks. By deploying servers within a wide variety of networks across 131 countries, we
are better able to manage and control routing and delivery quality to geographically diverse users. We also have thousands of
peering relationships that provide us with direct paths to end-user networks, which reduce data loss, while also potentially
giving us more options for delivery at reduced cost.
To make this wide-reaching deployment effective, we use specialized technologies, such as advanced routing, load
balancing, data collection and monitoring. Our intelligent routing software is designed to ensure that website visitors
experience fast page loading, access to applications and content assembly wherever they are on the Internet and regardless of
global or local traffic conditions. Dedicated professionals staff our network operations command center 24 hours a day, seven
days a week to monitor and react to Internet traffic patterns and trends. We frequently deploy enhancements to our software
globally to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of our network.
Our platform offers ﬂexibility too. Customers can control the extent of their use of Akamai services to scale on demand,
using as much or as little capacity of the global platform as they require, to support widely varying traffic and rapid growth
without the need for expensive and complex internal infrastructure.
