As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company had approximately $77.1 million, $72.3 million and $41.1
million, respectively, of total unrecognized tax benefits, including $13.7 million, $10.0 million, and $7.7 million of accrued
interest and penalties as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits are recorded in the provision for income taxes and were $3.9 million, $2.2 million and $1.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If recognized, the aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits would have
resulted in a reduction of income tax expense, impacting the effective income tax rate.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that $15.8 million of its unrecognized tax
benefits may be recognized by the end of 20 17 as a result of the expiration of local statutes of limitations. Certain state and
foreign income tax returns from 2011 through 2014 are currently under audit in those jurisdictions, including an audit in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Company has reserved for those positions that are not more likely than not of being
sustained.
Generally, in the US. federal and state taxing jurisdictions, tax periods in which certain loss and credit carryovers are
generated remain open for audit until such time as the limitation period ends for the year in which such losses or credits are
utilized. In major foreign jurisdictions, tax years after 2012 are open for examination.
17. Net Income per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
applicable period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential common stock. Potential common stock consists of shares issuable
pursuant to stock options, RSUS, DSUS, convertible senior notes and warrants issued by the Company. The dilutive effect of
outstanding awards and convertible securities is reﬂected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock
method.
The following table sets forth the components used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except per share data):
