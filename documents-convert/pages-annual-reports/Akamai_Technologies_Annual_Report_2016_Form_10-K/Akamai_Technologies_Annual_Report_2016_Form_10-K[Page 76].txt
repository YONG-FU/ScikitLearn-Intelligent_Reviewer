14. Employee Beneﬁt Plan
The Company has established a savings plan for its employees that is designed to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees are permitted to contribute to this plan through payroll deductions within statutory
and plan limits. The Company contributed approximately $13.7 million, $13.1 million and $16.6 million of cash to the savings
plan for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under a matching program.
15. Stock-Based Compensation
Equity Plans
In May 2013, the Company's stockholders approved the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2013
Plan"). The 2013 Plan replaced the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan”), which in turn
replaced the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan
and the Akamai Technologies, Inc. 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (together with the 2009 Plan, the "Previous Plans"). The
Company no longer issues equity awards under the Previous Plans, and they solely exist to satisfy outstanding equity awards
previously granted under those plans. The 2013 Plan allows for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards up to
11.0 million shares of common stock to employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisers of the Company. Additionally,
the Company may grant up to 3.8 million shares of common stock thereunder that were available for grant under the 2009 Plan
immediately prior to stockholder approval of the 2013 Plan. Any shares of common stock that are currently outstanding under
the Previous Plans that are terminated, canceled, surrendered or forfeited will become available to grant under the 2013 Plan.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had reserved approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock available for future
issuance of equity awards under the 2013 Plan.
The Company has assumed certain stock option plans and the outstanding stock options of companies that it has acquired
(“Assumed Plans”). Stock options outstanding as of the date of acquisition under the Assumed Plans were exchanged for the
Company’s stock options and adjusted to reﬂect the appropriate conversion ratio as specified by the applicable acquisition
agreement, but are otherwise administered in accordance with the terms of the Assumed Plans. Stock options under the
Assumed Plans generally vest over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.
The 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("1999 ESPP") permits eligible employees to purchase up to 1.5 million shares
each June 1 and December 1, provided that the aggregate number of shares issued shall not exceed 20.0 million. The 1999
ESPP allows participants to purchase shares of common stock at a 15% discount from the fair market value of the stock as
determined on specific dates at six-month intervals. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company
issued 0.9 million, 0.7 million and 0.7 million shares under the 1999 ESPP, respectively, with a weighted average purchase
price per share of $46.23, $52.05 and $41.76, respectively. Total cash proceeds from the purchase of shares under the 1999
ESPP in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $39.9 million, $34.8 million and $29.3 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, approximately $5.1 million had been withheld from employees for future purchases under the 1999
ESPP.
