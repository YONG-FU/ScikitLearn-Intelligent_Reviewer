The increase in our revenue from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of continued strong growth from our Cloud
Security Solutions, which grew 43%. Our web performance solutions also contributed to our revenue growth in 2016. Our
overall revenue growth rate was lower than it has been in the past, primarily due to the "do-it—yourself” efforts of our Internet
Platform Customers, some of which have developed internal infrastructure to deliver more of their media content themselves
rather than rely on our media services. Revenue from these six customers (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and
Netﬂix) in the aggregate was $250.4 million and $379.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in our revenue from 2014 to 2015 was driven by higher demand for our services across all of our solutions
and geographies, with particularly strong growth from our Cloud Security Solutions. Revenue from our Internet Platform
Customers was $379.3 million and $358.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
