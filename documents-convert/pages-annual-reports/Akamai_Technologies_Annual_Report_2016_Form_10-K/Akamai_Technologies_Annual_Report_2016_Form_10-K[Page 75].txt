Indemniﬁcation
The Company enters into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these
agreements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or
incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Company's business partners, vendors or customers, in connection with its
provision of its services. Generally, these obligations are limited to claims relating to infringement of a patent, copyright or
other intellectual property right or the Company’s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law. Subject to applicable
statutes of limitation, the term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual from the time of execution of the
agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these
indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company carries insurance that covers certain third party claims relating
to its services and activities and that could limit the Company’s exposure in that respect.
The Company has agreed to indemnify each of its officers and directors during his or her lifetime for certain events or
occurrences that happen by reason of the fact that the officer or director is or was or has agreed to serve as an officer or director
of the Company. The Company has director and officer insurance policies that may limit its exposure and may enable the
Company to recover a portion of certain future amounts paid.
To date, the Company has not encountered material costs as a result of such indemnification obligations and has not
accrued any related liabilities in its financial statements. In assessing whether to establish an accrual, the Company considers
such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount
of loss.
12. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock Repurchase Program
In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, effective from October
2013 through December 2016. In February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a $1.0 billion share
repurchase program that superseded the October 2013 repurchase program and is effective from February 2016
through December 2018. The Company's goal for the share repurchase program is to offset the dilution created by its employee
equity compensation programs and provide the ﬂexibility to return capital to shareholders as business and market conditions
warrant.
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company repurchased 7.0 million, 4.5 million and 4.6
million shares, respectively, of its common stock for $373.8 million, $302.6 million and $268.6 million, respectively, pursuant
to the current repurchase program as well as prior ones approved by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2016, the
Company had $694.5 million available for future purchases of shares under the current repurchase program.
The Board of Directors authorized the retirement of all the outstanding shares of its treasury stock as of each of December
31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The retired shares were returned to the number of authorized but unissued shares of the Company's
common stock, and the retirement was recorded to additional paid-in capital.
