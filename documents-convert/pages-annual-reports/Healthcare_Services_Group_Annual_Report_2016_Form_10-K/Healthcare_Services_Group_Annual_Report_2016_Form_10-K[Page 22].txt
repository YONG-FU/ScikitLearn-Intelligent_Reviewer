investments are reﬂected as decreases to selling, general and administrative expense, as such losses decrease the amount of the deferred compensation
liability.
Excluding the change in the deferred compensation plan, consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for 2016 decreased $7.8 million or 7.0%
compared to 2015 , in which consolidated selling, general and administrative expense was negatively impacted by legal expenses associated with settlements
regarding certain employment-related matters. The change in the value of the deferred compensation plan is a result of changes in the market value on the balance
of investments held in our deferred compensation plan.

Investment and interest income, as a percentage of consolidated revenues, increased to 0.2% for 2016 compared to less than 0.1% for 2015 , primarily due to
favorable market ﬂuctuations in the value of our investments.

Our effective tax rate was 35.7% for 2016 and 35.4% for 2015 . Differences between the effective tax rates and the applicable US. federal statutory rate arise
primarily from the effect of state and local taxes and tax credits available to the Company. The Company participates in the Work Opportunity Tax Credit
(“WOTC”) program, through which we hire and retain employees from target groups with significant barriers to employment. As part of the program, the
Company receives tax credits, and although the Company has increased its participation in the program year-over-year, the increase in the effective tax rate is
primarily related to the ratio of the tax credits to higher pre-tax book income in 2016 as compared to the prior year. This credit is currently scheduled to expire on
December 31, 2019.
