Costs of services provided
Consolidated
Consolidated costs of services increased 7.0% to $1.24 billion in 2015 compared to $1.16 billion in 2014 . The increase in costs of services is a result of growth in
our consolidated revenues, partially offset by the one-time, non-cash change in estimate related to our self-insurance liability that occurred during 2014. Certain
significant components within our costs of services are subject to ﬂuctuation with the changes in our business and client base. The increase during 2015 compared
to 2014 relates primarily to labor and other labor related costs. Historically, these significant components accounted for approximately 96% to 98% of consolidated
costs of services.
As a percentage of consolidated revenues, cost of services decreased to 86.0% in 2015 from 89.3% in 2014 . The following table provides a comparison of the key
indicators we consider when managing the consolidated cost of services:
Year Ended December 31,
Costs of Services Provided - Key Indicators as % of Consolidated Revenue _ 2015 _ 2014 _ % Change
[Bad debt provision 0.3% 0.3% —% 1
Workers’ compensation and general liability insurance 3.4% 5.5% (2.1)%
The bad debt provision remained consistent due to our assessment of the collectability of our accounts and notes receivables.
The workers’ compensation and general liability insurance expense decreased in 2015 due to the 2014 change in estimate which resulted in a one-time, non-cash
charge to reﬂect certain costs related to the estimated current and future insurance claims projected to be paid out.
Reportable Segments
Costs of services provided for Housekeeping, as a percentage of Housekeeping revenues for 2015 , decreased to 90.7% compared to 91.7% in 2014 . Costs of
services provided for Dietary, as a percentage of Dietary revenues for 2015 , decreased to 94.0% compared to 94.1% in 2014 .
The following table provides a comparison of the key indicators we consider when managing cost of services at the segment level, as a percentage of the respective
segment’s revenues:
Year Ended December 31,
Costs of Services Provided - Key Indicators as % of Segment Revenue _ 2015 _ 2014 _ % Change
{Housekeeping labor and other labor costs 79.4% 81.0% (1 .6)% 1
Housekeeping supplies 8.3% 8.2% 0.1%
[Dietary labor and other labor costs 52.9% 51.0% 1.9% 1
Dietary supplies 38.7% 40.7% (2.0)%
The ratios of these key indicators to revenue remain relatively consistent. Variations relate to the provision of services at new facilities and changes in the mix of
clients for whom we provide supplies or do not provide supplies. Management focuses on building efficiencies and managing labor and other costs at the facility
level, as well as managing supply chain costs, for new and existing facilities.
