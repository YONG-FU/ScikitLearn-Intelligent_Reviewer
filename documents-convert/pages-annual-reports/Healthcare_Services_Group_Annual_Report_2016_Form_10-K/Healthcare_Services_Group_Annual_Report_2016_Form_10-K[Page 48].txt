Impaired Notes Receivable
We evaluate our notes receivable for impairment quarterly and on an individual client basis. Notes receivable are generally evaluated for impairment when the
respective clients are either in bankruptcy, are subject to collections activity or are slow payers that are experiencing ﬁnancial difficulties. In the event that our
evaluation results in a determination that a note receivable is impaired, it is valued at the present value of expected cash ﬂows or at the market value of related
collateral. Summary schedules of impaired notes receivable, and the related reserve, for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

For impaired notes receivable, interest income is recognized on a cost recovery basis only. As a result, no interest income was recognized on impaired notes
receivable. We follow an income recognition policy on all other notes receivable that does not recognize interest income until cash payments are received. This
policy was established, recognizing the environment of the long-term care industry, and not because such notes receivable are necessarily impaired. The difference
between income recognition on a full accrual basis and cash basis, for notes receivable that are not considered impaired, is not material.
