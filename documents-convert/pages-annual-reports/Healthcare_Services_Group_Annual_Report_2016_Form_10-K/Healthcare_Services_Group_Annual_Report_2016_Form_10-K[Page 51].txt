Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company offers an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) to all eligible employees. All full-time and certain part-time employees who have completed two
years of continuous service with us are eligible to participate. The ESPP was scheduled to expire after 2016 , however the Board of Directors extended the ESPP
for an additional five offerings through 2021. Annual offerings commence and terminate on the respective year’s first and last calendar day.
Under the ESPP, the Company is authorized to issue up to 4.1 million shares of our common stock to our employees. Pursuant to such authorization, we have 2.3
million shares available for future grant at December 31, 2016 (after deducting the 2016 funding of the 53 thousand shares delivered in 2017 ). Under the terms of
the ESPP, participants may contribute through payroll deductions up to $21,250 ( 85% of IRS limitation) of their compensation toward the purchase of the
Company’s common stock. No employee may purchase common stock which exceeds $25,000 in fair market value (determined on the option date) for each
calendar year. The option price per share is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market price on the first day of the offering period, or 85% of the fair market price
on the last day of the offering period.

Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company offers a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain key executives and employees. The SERP is not qualified under Section 401
of the Internal Revenue Code. The SERP allows participants to defer up to 25% of their earned income on a pre-tax basis and as of the last day of each plan year,
each participant will be credited with a 25% match of up to 15% of their deferral in the form of our Common Stock based on the then-current market value. SERP
participants fully vest in our matching contribution three years from the first day of the initial year of participation. The income deferred and our matching
contributions are unsecured and subject to the claims of our general creditors.
Under the SERP, we are authorized to issue up to 1.0 million shares of our common stock to our employees. Pursuant to such authorization, we have 0.4 million
shares available for future grant at December 31, 2016 (after deducting the 2016 funding of 13 thousand shares delivered in 2017 ). At the time of issuance, such
shares were accounted for at cost as treasury stock. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 0.3 million such shares are vested and remain in the respective active
participants’ accounts with the trustee.
