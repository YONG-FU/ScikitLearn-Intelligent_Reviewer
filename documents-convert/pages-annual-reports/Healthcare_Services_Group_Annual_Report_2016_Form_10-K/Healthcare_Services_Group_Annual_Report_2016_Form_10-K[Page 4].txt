CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, which are not historical facts but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and
projections about our business and industry, our beliefs and assumptions. Words such as “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “goal,” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The inclusion of forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that
any of our plans will be achieved. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise. Such forward-looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry, primarily providers of long-term care; credit and collection risks
associated with this industry; having several clients who individually contributed over 5% , with one as high as 9.5% , of our total consolidated revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2016 ; our claims experience related to workers’ compensation and general liability insurance; the effects of changes in, or
interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry, our workforce and services provided, including state and local regulations pertaining to the
taxability of our services and other labor related matters such as minimum wage increases; continued realization of tax beneﬁts arising from our corporate
reorganization and self-funded health insurance program; risks associated with the reorganization of our corporate structure; and the risk factors described in Part I
in this report under “Government Regulation of Clients,” “Competition” and “Service Agreements and Collections,” and under Item IA “Risk Factors.”
These factors, in addition to delays in payments from clients and/or clients in bankruptcy or clients for which we are in litigation to collect payment, have resulted
in, and could continue to result in, signiﬁcant additional bad debts in the near future. Additionally, our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected
increases in the costs of labor and labor-related costs, materials, supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients.
In addition, we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients, retain and provide new services
to existing clients, achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various
operational levels. Furthermore, we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future
operating results and the successful execution of our projected growth strategies.
