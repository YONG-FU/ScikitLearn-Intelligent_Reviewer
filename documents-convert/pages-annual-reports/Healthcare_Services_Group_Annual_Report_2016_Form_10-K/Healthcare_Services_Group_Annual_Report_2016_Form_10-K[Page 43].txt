In November 2015, the F ASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes . The amendment in this ASU requires that deferred tax assets
and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of ﬁnancial position. The guidance becomes
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Management elected to adopt the standard in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2016, with retrospective application to prior period balances presented. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 merely resulted in the reclassiﬁcation within the
asset section of the balance sheet and did not have a material impact on the Company’s working capital or consolidated financial statements.

Note 3—Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets, and is computed using the
straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated asset life or term of the lease. Repairs and maintenance costs are
charged to expense as incurred.
The following table sets forth the amounts of property and equipment by each class of depreciable assets as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 :
