becomes available to more accurately estimate collectability. Once our recovery of a receivable is determined, through litigation, bankruptcy proceedings or
negotiation, to be less than the recorded amount on our balance sheet, we will charge the applicable amount to the Allowance.
Summarized below for the years 2014 through 2016 are the aggregate account balances for the Allowance criteria noted above, net of write-offs of client accounts,
bad debt provision and allowance for doubtful accounts:

2015 $ 12,073 $ 5,863 $ 4,335 $ 4,608
12016 $ 15,873 $ 2,326 $ 4,629 $ 6,911 1
At December 31, 2016 , we identified accounts totaling $159 million that require an Allowance based on potential impairment or loss of value. An Allowance
totaling $69 million was provided for these accounts at such date. Actual collections of these accounts could differ from our current estimate. If our actual
collection experience is 5% less than our estimate, the related increase to our Allowance would decrease net income by approximately $0.3 million .
Despite our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure, our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends, as more fully discussed under Liquidity and
Capital Resources below, and in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I under “Risk Factors,” “Government Regulation of Clients” and “Service Agreements
and Collections,” change in such a manner as to negatively impact the cash ﬂows of our clients. If our clients experience a negative impact in their cash ﬂows, it
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Accrued Insurance Claims
We currently have a Paid Loss Retrospective Insurance Plan for general liability and workers” compensation insurance, which comprise approximately 46.2% of
our liabilities at December 31, 2016 . Under our insurance plans for general liability and workers’ compensation, predetermined loss limits are arranged with our
insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost. Our accounting for this plan utilizes current valuations from a third
party actuary, which include assumptions based on data such as historical claims, pay-out experience, demographic factors, industry trends, severity factors, and
other actuarial calculations. In the event that our claims experience and/or industry trends result in an unfavorable change in our assumptions or outcomes, it would
have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
For workers’ compensation and general liability, we record both a reserve for the estimated future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but
not settled, as well as an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Such reserves for claims incurred but not reported are developed by a third party actuary
through review of our historical data and open claims.
A summary of the changes in our total self-insurance liability is as follows:

Asset Valuations and Review for Potential Impairment
We review our fixed assets, deferred income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that their
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. This review requires that we make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that
would affect the carrying value of these assets. If such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist, we are then required to estimate the fair value of the
asset and, as deemed apprOpriate,
