Note 4—G00dwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for
impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $44.4
million.
Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets were acquired through acquisitions and are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets with determinable lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The customer relationships have a weighted-average amortization period of 9.7 years . As of
December 31, 2015, the Company’s non-compete agreements and certain of the Company’s customer relationship intangible assets had been fully amortized and
the respective balances were written-off during 2016.

Note 5—Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s current assets (other than marketable securities and inventories) and current liabilities are ﬁnancial instruments and most of these items are
recorded at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated fair value of these ﬁnancial instruments approximates their carrying value due to their short-
term nature. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis are our marketable securities and our deferred compensation funding.
The Company’s marketable securities consist of tax-exempt municipal bonds, which we classify as available-for-sale and which are reported at fair value.
Unrealized gains and losses associated with these investments are included in other comprehensive income (net of tax) within our consolidated statements of
comprehensive income. The fair value of these marketable securities is
