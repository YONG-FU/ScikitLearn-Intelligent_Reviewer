Costs of services provided
Consolidated
Consolidated costs of services increased 8.4% to $1.34 billion in 2016 compared to $1.24 billion in 2015 . The increase in costs of services is primarily driven by
higher labor and other labor related costs associated with overall growth. Such costs of services, along with the costs of supplies, are subject to ﬂuctuation with the
changes in our business and client base. Historically, these signiﬁcant components accounted for approximately 96% to 98% of consolidated costs of services.
As a percentage of consolidated revenues, cost of services decreased to 85.7% in 2016 from 86.0% in 2015 . The following table provides a comparison of the key
indicators we consider when managing the consolidated cost of services:
Year Ended December 31,
Costs of Services Provided - Key Indicators as % of Consolidated Revenue _ 2016 _ 2015 _ % Change
[Bad debt provision 0.3% 0.3% —% 1
Workers’ compensation and general liability insurance 3.0% 3.4% (0.4)%
The bad debt provision remained consistent due to our assessment of the collectability of our accounts and notes receivables.
The decrease in workers’ compensation and general liability insurance expense as a percentage of consolidated revenue is primarily the result of the Company’s
ongoing initiative to promote safety and accident prevention in the workplace, as well as proactive management of workers’ compensation claims, which have
positively impacted our claims experience.
Reportable Segments
Costs of services provided for Housekeeping, as a percentage of Housekeeping revenues for 2016 , decreased to 90.5% compared to 90.7% in 2015 . Cost of
services provided for Dietary, as a percentage of Dietary revenues for 2016 , increased to 94.3% compared to 94.0% in 2015 .
The following table provides a comparison of the key indicators we consider when managing cost of services at the segment level, as a percentage of the respective
segment’s revenues:
Year Ended December 31,
Costs of Services Provided - Key Indicators as % of Segment Revenue _ 2016 _ 2015 _ % Change
{Housekeeping labor and other labor costs 80.2% 79.4% 0.8% 1
Housekeeping supplies 7.8% 8.3% (0.5)%
[Dietary labor and other labor costs 53.8% 52.9% 0.9% 1
Dietary supplies 38.0% 38.7% (0.7)%
The ratios of these key indicators remain relatively consistent. Variations relate to the provision of services at new facilities and changes in the mix of clients for
whom we provide supplies or do not provide supplies. Management focuses on building efﬁciencies and managing labor and other costs at the facility level, as
well as managing supply chain costs, for new and existing facilities.
