Investing Activities
The principal uses of net cash for investing activities are the purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures such as housekeeping and food service
equipment, computer software and equipment, and furniture and fixtures (see “Capital Expenditures” below for additional information).
Our investments in marketable securities are primarily comprised of tax-exempt municipal bonds and are intended to achieve our goal of preserving principal,
maintaining adequate liquidity and maximizing returns subject to our investment guidelines. Our investment policy limits investment to certain types of
instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment-grade ratings and places restrictions on concentration by type and issuer. In 2015, we increased our
investments in these liquid securities in conjunction with the transfer of the Company’s workers compensation and certain employee health and welfare insurance
programs to HCSG Insurance Corp. (the “Captive”).
Financing Activities
The primary use of cash for financing activities is the payment of dividends. We have paid regular quarterly cash dividends since the second quarter of 2003.
During 2016 , we paid to shareholders regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $53.3 million as follows.

Additionally, on January 31, 2017 , our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $018625 per common share, which will be paid on
March 24, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 17, 2017 .
The dividends paid to shareholders during the year ended December 31, 2016 were funded by the existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by
the Company. Our Board of Directors reviews our dividend policy on a quarterly basis. Although there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends
or the amount of the dividend, we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend. In connection with the establishment of our dividend policy, we
adopted a Dividend Reinvestment Plan in 2003.
During 2016 we elected not to purchase any of our common stock but we remain authorized to purchase 1.7 million shares of our common stock pursuant to
previous Board of Directors’ authorization.

Line of Credit
We have a $200 million bank line of credit on which we may draw to meet short—term liquidity requirements. Amounts drawn under the line of credit are payable
upon demand. At December 31, 2016 , there were no borrowings under the line of credit. However, at such date, we had outstanding a $63.7 million irrevocable
standby letter of credit, which relates to payment obligations under our insurance programs. As a result of the letter of credit issued, the amount available under the
line of credit was reduced by $63.7 million at December 31, 2016 .
