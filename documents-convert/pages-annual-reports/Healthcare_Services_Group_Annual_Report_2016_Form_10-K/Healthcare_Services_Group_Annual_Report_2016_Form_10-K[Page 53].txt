Realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
Management assesses the Company’s income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon an evaluation of the facts,
circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates, which include historical operating results and expectations of future earnings. As such,
management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded will be realized to reduce future income taxes and therefore no valuation
allowances are necessary.
