The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements (‘ASRs”) with financial
institutions. In exchange for up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the
purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid
per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the volume weighted-average price
of the Company’s common stock during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and the up-
front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the
periods the payments are made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period delivered for
purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the
applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.
The following table shows the Company’s ASR activity and related information during the years ended September 24, 2016 and

(1) “Number of Shares” represents those shares delivered in the beginning of the purchase period and does not represent the final
number of shares to be delivered under the ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average
repurchase price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the purchase period based on the volume-weighted average
price of the Company’s common stock during that period. The August 2016 ASR purchase period will end in or before November
2016.
(2) Includes 48.2 million shares delivered and retired at the beginning of the purchase period, which began in the third quarter of
2016, and 12.3 million shares delivered and retired at the end of the purchase period, which concluded in the fourth quarter of
2016.
