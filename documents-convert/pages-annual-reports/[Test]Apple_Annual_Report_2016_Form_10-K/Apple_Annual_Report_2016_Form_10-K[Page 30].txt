The Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2017 to be between 38% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement
regarding the Company’s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from
actual results. The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth
in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company
believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global
product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost
of components, and potential strengthening of the US. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing
services and a potential shift in the Company’s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive
pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross
margins could also be affected by the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate
demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company’s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating
results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.

Research and Development
The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses,
and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are
critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that
are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary
expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses. The year-over-year growth
in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, and higher
spending on marketing and advertising.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):
2016 Change 2015 Change 2014

The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income,
partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity. The weighted-
average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.73%, 1.49% and 1.11%
in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
