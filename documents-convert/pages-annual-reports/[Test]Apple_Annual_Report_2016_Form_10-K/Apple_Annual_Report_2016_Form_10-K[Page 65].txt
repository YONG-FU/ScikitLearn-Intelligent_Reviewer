Note 9 — Benefit Plans
2014 Employee Stock Plan
In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s
authority to grant new awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based
equity grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based awards,
stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over
four years, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-
one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant
under the plan by two shares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the number of
shares available for grant under the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs cancelled or shares withheld.
Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the
same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions
as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014
Plan, the Company reserved 385 million shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but not issued under the
2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise terminate, or are
withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of
September 24, 2016, approximately 386.4 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2014 Plan.
