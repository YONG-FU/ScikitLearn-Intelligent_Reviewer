The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons including, but not
limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable
securities generally range from one to five years.
The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature.
The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating
an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair
value has been below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market interest rates
and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the
investment’s cost basis.As of September 24, 2016, the Company does not consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected
future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities. However, the
Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations
and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a
portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.
To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the U.S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar and who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated
in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to
manage this risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges.The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted
foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
