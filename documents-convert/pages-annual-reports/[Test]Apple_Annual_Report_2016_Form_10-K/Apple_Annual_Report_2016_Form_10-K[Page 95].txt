PERFORMANCE AWARD
EXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the
Vesting Date will be determined based on the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile
for the Performance Period.
The percentage of the Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting
Date will be determined as follows:
0 If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile
or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.
0 If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile,
[ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.
0 If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile,
[ ] ([ ]%) of the target Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.
0 Ifthe Company’s TSR Percentile forthe Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile,
[ ] ([ ]%) of the Stock Units will vest on the Vesting Date.
For TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above,
the portion of the Stock Units that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis
(i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in no
event shall more than one hundred percent (100%) of the target Stock Units vest.
The number of Stock Units that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit,
and the balance of the Stock Units will not vest and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:
0 “TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for
the Comparison Group members forthe Performance Period. In determining the Company’s
TSR Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the Company’s TSR for the
Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members
for that same period, the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking
the Company’s TSR for that period as being greater than such other Comparison Group
members.
0 “Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first day of the Performance Period and, except as
provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues to be listed
or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance
Period. In the event a member of the Comparison Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates
due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be treated as a Comparison Group
member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or
similar equity security) of such company is no longer listed or traded on a national securities
