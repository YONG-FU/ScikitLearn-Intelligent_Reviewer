Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):
7 2016 7 7 2015 7 7 2014 7
Provision for income taxes 15,685 $ 19,121 $ 13,973 7
Effective tax rate 25.6% 26.4% 26.1%
The Company’s effective tax rates for 2016, 2015 and 2014 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to
certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which
no US. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the US. The lower effective tax
rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to
2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes.
As of September 24, 2016, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax
credits of $4.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted
income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate
the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the IRS on its examination of the years 2010
through 2012. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not
significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating
to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities. In major states and major
foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination bythe taxing authorities.
Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However,
the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a
manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in
the period such resolution occurs.
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing
tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the
"State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the
period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application
of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal
to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid
Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of
additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once
the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow,
pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would
be creditable against US. taxes.
