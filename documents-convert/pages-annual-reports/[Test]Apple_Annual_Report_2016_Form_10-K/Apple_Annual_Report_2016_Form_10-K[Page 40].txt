To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company’s foreign currency derivative
positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to assess the potential impact of
fluctuations in exchange rates.The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market
price paths assuming normal market conditions.The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval,
to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to
represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions.
Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the
model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of
$434 million as of September 24, 2016 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of September 26, 2015.
Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments
are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially
from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 24, 2016 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the
timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.
