Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits and the future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greaterthan 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.The Company classifies gross interest and penalties
and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of September 24, 2016, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.7 billion, of which $2.8 billion, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was
$6.9 billion, of which $2.5 billion, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.
