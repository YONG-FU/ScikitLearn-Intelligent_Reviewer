exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of
a new parent company by a Comparison Group member, substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of which consist immediately after the transaction of the equity interests in the
original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison Group
member immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted
for the Comparison Group memberto the extent (and for such period of time) as its common
stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a national securities exchange but
the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member
are not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two Comparison Group
members (including, without limitation, the acquisition of one Comparison Group member,
or all or substantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member), the surviving,
resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member
of the Comparison Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of
such entity is listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day
of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable
stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary
to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction.
0 “TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group
member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i) the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable
Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and other distributions
during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash
distributions shall be valued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the
value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested
in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.
0 “Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group
member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the
principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading
days ending with the last trading day before the beginning of the Performance Period. For
the purpose of determining Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions
shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing
market price on the date of distribution.
0 “Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group
member, the average of the closing market prices of such company’s common stock on the
principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20) consecutive trading
days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. Forthe purpose of determining
Ending Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating
them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of
distribution.
With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an
equitable and proportionate adjustment to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives
of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or reverse stock split occurring during
the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending
Price, as the case may be).
