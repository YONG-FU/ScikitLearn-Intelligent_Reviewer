The following table shows the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do
not represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to
perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency or interest rates at each respective date. The
Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. Although the table
above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses
associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon
settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual
market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.
The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement
of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security
arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates
from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair
values in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company related to derivative instruments under
its collateral security arrangements was $163 million as of September 24, 2016 and $1.0 billion as of September 26, 2015, which
were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is
allowed to net settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the
effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively,
resulting in a net derivative asset of $160 million and a net derivative liability of $78 million, respectively.
Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers,
value-added resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company
generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit
credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain
customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are
directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade
receivables, which accounted for 10% and 12%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 63% and 71%
of trade receivables as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components
directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47% and 21% of total vendor
non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2016 and three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total
vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015.
