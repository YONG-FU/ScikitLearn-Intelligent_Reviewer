iPhone net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015.The Company believes the sales decline is due primarily
to a lower rate of iPhone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major
markets in 2016. Average selling prices (‘ASPs”) for iPhone were lower year-over-year during 2016 due primarily to a different mix
of iPhones, including the iPhone SE introduced in 2016, and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the US.

The year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone 6 and
6 Plus during 2015. Overall ASPs for iPhone increased during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone
6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the US. dollar.
