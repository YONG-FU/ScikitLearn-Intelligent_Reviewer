(1) In April 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the Company's share repurchase program authorization from $140
billion to $175 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of September 24, 2016, $133 billion of the $175 billion had been
utilized. The remaining $42 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the authorized
repurchase program as of September 24, 2016. The Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any
specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market
transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
(2) In May 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase arrangement ("ASR") to purchase up to $6.0 billion
of the Company's common stock. In August 2016, the purchase period for this ASR ended and an additional 12.3 million shares
were delivered and retired. In total, 60.5 million shares were delivered under this ASR at an average repurchase price of $99.25.
(3) In August 2016, the Company entered into a new ASR to purchase up to $3.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. In exchange
for an up-front payment of $3.0 billion, the financial institution party to the arrangement committed to deliver shares to the
Company during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before November 2016. The total number of shares ultimately
delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable purchase period based
on the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that period.
