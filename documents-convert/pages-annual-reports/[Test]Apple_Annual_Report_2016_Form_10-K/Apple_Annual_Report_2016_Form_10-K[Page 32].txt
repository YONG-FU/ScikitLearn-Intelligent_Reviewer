Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (‘ASU 2016-02”), which modified lease accounting for
both lessees and lessors to increase transparency and comparability by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees
for those leases classified as operating leases under previous accounting standards and disclosing key information about leasing
arrangements. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial
statements.
Financial Instruments
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (‘ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its
first quarter of 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments (‘ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments.
ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2021 and early adoption is permitted. The Company
does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (‘ASU 2014-09”), which
amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition
of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective
for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted.
Subsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (‘ASU 2016-08”); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (‘ASU 2016-10”); and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (‘ASU 2016-12”). The Company must
adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standards”).
The new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative
effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter
of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect adoption of the new revenue standards to
have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its
working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing
operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends, the share repurchase
program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and
from borrowings.
