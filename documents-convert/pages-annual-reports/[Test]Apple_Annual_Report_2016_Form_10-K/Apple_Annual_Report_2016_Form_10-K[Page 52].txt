The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities
were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the
fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit
ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated
by observable market data.
In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.
Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement
The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into US. dollars using
exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that
approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency translation
included in AOCl in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure
monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and inventories, property and nonmonetary
assets and liabilities at historical rates.
