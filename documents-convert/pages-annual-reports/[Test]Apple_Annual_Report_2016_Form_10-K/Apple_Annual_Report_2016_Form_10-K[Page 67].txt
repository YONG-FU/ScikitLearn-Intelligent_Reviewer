The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $5.1 billion, $4.8 billion and $3.4 billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares
with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and
remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 15.9 million, 14.1 million and
15.6 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as
determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $1.7
billion, $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion in 2016,2015 and 2014, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced the
number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.
