The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of
September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.0 billion and $1.3
billion, respectively, which is classified as non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters,
the Company recognized interest and penalty expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $295 million, $709 million and $40 million,
respectively.
The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the US. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign
jurisdictions. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the US. Internal Revenue Service
(the “IRS”) on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax
benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years prior to 2013 are closed,
except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and
foreign tax authorities. In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and
could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities.
The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are
resolved in a manner not consistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes
in the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company believes
it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release or a combination of
both) in the next 12 months by up to $850 million.
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing
tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the
"State Aid Decision"). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the
period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application
of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal
to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid
Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to €13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of
additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once
the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow,
pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would
be creditable against US. taxes.
