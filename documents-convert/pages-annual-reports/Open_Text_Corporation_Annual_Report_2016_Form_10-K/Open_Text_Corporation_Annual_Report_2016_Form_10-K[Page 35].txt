Dividend Policy
Pursuant to a policy adopted by our Board of Directors in April 2013 to pay non-cumulative quarterly dividends, we paid
our first quarterly cash dividend in June 2013. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a
quarterly basis. However, future declarations of dividends are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors, in its
discretion, based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available
cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our Board of Directors may conclude would be in the best
interest of our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to relevant contractual limitations, including those in our
existing credit agreements and to solvency conditions established under the CBCA, the statute under which we are
incorporated. We have historically declared dividends in US. dollars, but registered shareholders can elect to receive dividends
in US. dollars or Canadian dollars by contacting the Company's transfer agent.
In Fiscal 2016, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends:
