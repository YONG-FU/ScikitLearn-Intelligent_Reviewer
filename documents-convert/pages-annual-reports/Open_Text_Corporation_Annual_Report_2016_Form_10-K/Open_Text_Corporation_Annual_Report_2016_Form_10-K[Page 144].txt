During the year ended June 30, 2016, we issued 15,000 Common Shares from our treasury stock, with a cost of $0.3
million, in connection with the settlement of vested RSUs (June 30, 2015—22,222 with a cost of $1.3 million, June 30, 2014—
22,222 with a cost of $0.5 million).
Deferred Stock Units (DSUS)
During the year ended June 30, 2016, we granted 55,858 DSUs to certain non-employee directors (June 30, 2015—
38,052, June 30, 2014=42,298). The DSUs were issued under our Deferred Share Unit Plan. DSUs granted as compensation
for directors fees vest immediately, whereas all other DSUs granted vest at our next annual general meeting following the
granting of the DSUs. No DSUs are payable by us until the director ceases to be a member of the Board.
Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)
We recently implemented a number of amendments to our ESPP, including increasing the purchase price discount from
5% to 15% and permitting Common Shares to be purchased on the open market by the trustee of a trust, or by an agent or
broker designated by an administrator, and transferred to eligible employees under the ESPP, as an alternative to the issuance of
Common Shares from treasury (the Amendments). The Amendments apply to purchase periods commencing on or after
January 1, 2016 unless otherwise determined by the Board or the compensation committee of the Board.
In accordance with the Amendments, during the year ended June 30, 2016, 80,273 Common Shares were eligible for
issuance to employees enrolled in the ESPP, after factoring a purchase price discount of 15%. Any Common Shares that have
been issued under the ESPP prior to the purchase period commencing on January 1, 2016 were issued at a purchase price
discount of 5%.
During the year ended June 30, 2016, cash in the amount of approximately $5.5 million was received from employees
relating to the ESPP (June 30, 2015—3331 million, June 30, 2014—$2.6 million).
