We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or, where appropriate, the
Monte Carlo Valuation Method, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, "Compensation—Stock
Compensation" (Topic 718) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The option-pricing models require input of subjective
assumptions, including the estimated life of the option and the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the estimated
life of the option. We use historical volatility as a basis for projecting the expected volatility of the underlying stock and
estimate the expected life of our stock options based upon historical data.
We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are apprOpriate
in calculating the fair value of our stock option grants. Estimates of fair value are not intended, however, to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards.
For the periods indicated, the weighted-average fair value of options and weighted-average assumptions were as follows:

As of June 30, 2016, the total compensation cost related to the unvested stock option awards not yet recognized was
approximately $24.7 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.3 years.
No cash was used by us to settle equity instruments granted under share-based compensation arrangements.
We have not capitalized any share-based compensation costs as part of the cost of an asset in any of the periods
presented.
