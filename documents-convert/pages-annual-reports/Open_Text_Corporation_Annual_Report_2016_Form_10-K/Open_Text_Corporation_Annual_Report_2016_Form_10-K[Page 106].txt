(1) Non-management directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their retainer and/or fees in the form of Common Share equivalent units under our
Directors' Deferred Share Unit Plan (DSU Plan) based on the value of the Company's shares as of the date fees would otherwise be paid. The DSU Plan
became effective February 2, 2010, is available to any non-management director of the Company and is designed to promote greater alignment of long-
term interests between directors of the Company and its shareholders. DSUS granted as compensation for directors fees vest immediately whereas the
annual DSU grant vests at the Company’s next annual general meeting. No DSUS are payable by the Company until the director ceases to be a member of
the Board.
