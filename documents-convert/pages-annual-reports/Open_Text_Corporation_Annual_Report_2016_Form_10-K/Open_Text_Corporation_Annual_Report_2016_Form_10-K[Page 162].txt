(1) For the purpose of these calculations, "earnings" is the amount resulting from adding together earnings before taxes, fixed
charges, and losses attributable to non-controlling interests. "Fixed charges" includes interest expensed, capitalized and the
amortization of capitalized expenses related to indebtedness.
(2) There were no preference shares outstanding for the indicated periods. Accordingly, the ratio of earnings to combined fixed
charges and preference dividends was identical to the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each period.
