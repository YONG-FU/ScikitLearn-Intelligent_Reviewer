(1) Assuming 100% achievement of the expected targets for the fiscal year in which the triggering event occurred.
(2) For a period of 90 days following the termination date, the Named Executive Officer has the right to exercise all options which are deemed to have vested
as of the date of termination.
(3) Employee and medical benefits provided to each Named Executive Officer immediately prior to the occurrence of the trigger event.
(4) For Mr. Barrenechea, the accelerated vesting includes 100% vesting of his Fiscal 2012 Awards.
In addition to the information identified above, each Named Executive Officer is entitled to all accrued payments up to
the date of termination, including all earned but unpaid short-term incentive amounts and earned but unpaid LTIP. Except as
otherwise required by law, we are required to make all these payments and provide these benefits over a period of 12 months or
24 months, depending on the Named Executive Officer’s entitlement and the circumstances which triggered our obligation to
make such payments and provide such benefits, from the date of the event which triggered our obligation. With respect to
payments to Mr. Barrenechea, the Company intends to make all required payments to Mr. Barrenechea no later than two and a
half months after the end of the later of the fiscal year or calendar year in which the payments are no longer subject to a
substantial risk of forfeiture.
In return for receiving the payments and the benefits described above, each Named Executive Oﬂicer must comply with
certain obligations in favour of the Company, including a non-disparagement obligation. Also, each Named Executive Officer
is bound by a confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement where the non-solicitation obligation lasts 6 months from the date
of termination of his employment.
Any breach by a Named Executive Oﬁicer of any provision of his contractual agreements may only be waived upon the
review and approval of the Board.
Quantitative Estimates of Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Further information regarding payments to our Named Executive Officers in the event of a termination or a change in
control may be found in the table below. This table sets forth the estimated amount of payments and other benefits each Named
Executive Officer would be entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the indicated event, assuming that the event occurred on
June 30, 2016. Amounts (i) potentially payable under plans which are generally available to all salaried employees, such as life
and disability insurance, and (ii) earned but unpaid, in both cases, are excluded from the table. The values related to vesting of
stock options and awards are based upon the fair market value of our Common Shares of $59.16 per share as reported on the
NASDAQ on June 30, 2016, the last trading day of our fiscal year. The other material assumptions made with respect to the
numbers reported in the table below are:
- Payments in Canadian dollars included herein are converted to US. dollars using an exchange rate, as of June 30,
2016, of 0.7553 10; and
- The salary and incentive payments are calculated based on the amounts of salary and incentive payments which were
payable to each Named Executive Officer as of June 30, 2016; and
