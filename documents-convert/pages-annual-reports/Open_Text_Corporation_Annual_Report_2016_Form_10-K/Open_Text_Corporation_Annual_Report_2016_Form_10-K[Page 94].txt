Awards granted in Fiscal 2016, under the Fiscal 2018 LTIP were in addition to the awards granted in Fiscal 2014 and

Fiscal 2018 LT 1P - PS Us
With respect to our PSUs, we use relative TSR to benchmark the Company’s performance against the performance of the
corporations comprising the constituents of the S&P Mid Cap 400 Software & Services Index (the Index). The Index is
comprised of 400 US. public companies with unadjusted market capitalization of $1.2 billion to $5.1 billion and is a useful
measure of the performance of mid-sized companies. Relative TSR is the sole measure for each Named Executive Officer's
performance over the relevant three year period for the Fiscal 2018 LTIP with respect to PSUs. If over the three year period, the
relative cumulative TSR of the Company compared to the cumulative TSR of the Index is greater than the 66th percentile, the
relative TSR target will be achieved in full. If it is negative at the end of the three year period, no payout will be made.
Otherwise, any target percentile achieved between 1% and 100% will be interpolated to determine a payout that can range from
1.5% to 150% of the target award based on the number of PSUs that were granted in connection with the Fiscal 2018 LTIP.
The amounts that may be realized for PSU awards under the Fiscal 2018 LTIP are as follows, calculated based on the
market price of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ as of June 30, 2016, and applied to the number of PSUs to be issued to
the Named Executive Officers based on target level achievement.
