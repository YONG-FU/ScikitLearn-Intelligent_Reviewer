Long- Term Incentive Plans
We incentivize our executive oﬂicers, in part, with long term compensation pursuant to our LTIP. The LTIP is a rolling
three year program that grants eligible employees a certain number of target Performance Share Units (PSUs) and/or Restricted
Share Units (RSUs). Target PSUs become vested upon the satisfaction of certain financial and/or operational performance
criteria (the Performance Conditions) that are determined at the time of the grant. Target RSUs become vested when an eligible
employee remains employed throughout the vesting period. LTIP grants that have recently vested, or have yet to vest, are
described below. LTIP grants will be referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K based upon the year in which the grants
are expected to vest.
Fiscal 2015 LT 1P
Grants made in Fiscal 2013 under the LTIP (collectively referred to as Fiscal 2015 LTIP), took effect in Fiscal 2013
starting on November 2, 2012 for the RSUs and December 3, 2012 for the PSUs. We settled the Fiscal 2015 LTIP by issuing
202,078 Common Shares from our treasury stock during the three months ended December 31, 2015, with a cost of $5.0
million.
Fiscal 2016 LT 1P
Grants made in Fiscal 2014 under the LTIP (collectively referred to as Fiscal 2016 LTIP) consisting of PSUs and RSUs,
took effect in Fiscal 2014 starting on November 1, 2013. The Performance Conditions for vesting of the PSUs are based solely
upon market conditions. RSUs granted are employee service-based awards and vest over the life of the Fiscal 2016 LTIP. We
expect to settle the Fiscal 2016 LTIP awards in stock.
Fiscal 201 7 LT 1P
Grants made in Fiscal 2015 under the LTIP (collectively referred to as Fiscal 2017 LTIP), consisting of PSUs and RSUs,
took effect in Fiscal 2015 starting on September 4, 2014. The Performance Conditions for vesting of the PSUs are based solely
upon market conditions. The RSUs are employee service-based awards and vest over the life of the Fiscal 2017 LTIP. We
expect to settle the Fiscal 2017 LTIP awards in stock.
Fiscal 2018 LT 1P
Grants made in Fiscal 2016 under the LTIP (collectively referred to as Fiscal 2018 LTIP), consisting of PSUs and RSUs,
took effect in Fiscal 2016 starting on August 23, 2015. The Performance Conditions for vesting of the PSUs are based solely
upon market conditions. The RSUs are employee service-based awards and vest over the life of the Fiscal 2018 LTIP. We
expect to settle the Fiscal 2018 LTIP awards in stock.
PSUs and RSUs granted under the LTIPs have been measured at fair value as of the effective date, consistent with Topic
718, and will be charged to share-based compensation expense over the remaining life of the plan. Stock options granted under
the LTIPs have been measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with Topic 718. We estimate the fair
value of PSUs using the Monte Carlo pricing model and RSUs have been valued based upon their grant date fair value.
As of June 30, 2016, the total expected compensation cost related to the unvested LTIP awards not yet recognized was
$12.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years.
Restricted Share Units (RSUs)
During the year ended June 30, 2016, we granted 61,036 RSUs to employees in accordance with employment and other
agreements (June 30, 2015=45,000, June 30, 2014—nil). The RSUs vest over a specified contract date, typically three years
from the respective date of grants. We expect to settle the awards in stock.
