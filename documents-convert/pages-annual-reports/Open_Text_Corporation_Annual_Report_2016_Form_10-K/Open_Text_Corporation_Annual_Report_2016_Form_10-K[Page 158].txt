NOTE 21—EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the weighted average number
of Common Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable
to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share
equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method. Common Share equivalents are excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.

NOTE 22—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Our procedure regarding the approval of any related party transaction requires that the material facts of such transaction
be reviewed by the independent members of the Audit Committee and the transaction be approved by a majority of the
independent members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews all transactions in which we are, or will be, a
participant and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest. In determining whether to approve a related party
transaction, the Audit Committee generally takes into account, among other facts it deems appr0priate, whether the transaction
is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaﬂiliated third party under the same or similar
circumstances; the extent and nature of the related person’s interest in the transaction; the benefits to the Company of the
proposed transaction; if applicable, the effects on a director’s independence; and if applicable, the availability of other sources
of comparable services or products.
During the year ended June 30, 2016, Mr. Stephen Sadler, a director, earned $0.8 million (June 30, 2015—$0.5 million,
June 30, 2014—$0.7 million) in consulting fees from OpenText for assistance with acquisition-related business activities.
Mr. Sadler abstained from voting on all transactions from which he would potentially derive consulting fees.
NOTE 23—SUBSEQUEN T EVENTS
Internal Reorganization
In July 2016, we implemented a reorganization of our subsidiaries worldwide with the view to continuing to enhance
operational and administrative eﬂiciencies through further consolidated ownership, management, and development of our
intellectual property (IP) in Canada, continuing to reduce the number of entities in our group and working towards our
objective of having a single operating legal entity in each jurisdiction. We believe our reorganization also reduces our exposure
to global political and tax uncertainties, particularly in Europe. We believe that further consolidating our IP in Canada will
continue to ensure appropriate legal protections for our consolidated IP, simplify legal, accounting and tax compliance, and
improve our global cash management.
A material tax benefit, currently expected to be several hundred million dollars, associated with the recognition of a net
deferred tax asset is expected to be realized upon the completion of the IP reorganization in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. This
is anticipated to have a material impact of reducing our tax provision in Fiscal 2017 as well as our consolidated income tax rate
in Fiscal 2017.
