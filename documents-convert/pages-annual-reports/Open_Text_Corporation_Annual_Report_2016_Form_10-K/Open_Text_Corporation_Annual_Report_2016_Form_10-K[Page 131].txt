Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-l3
“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASU 2016-13),
which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us
in our first quarter for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with earlier adoption permitted beginning in the first quarter of our
fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 “Financial Instruments - Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01). This update requires that all equity investments be
measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under the
equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). This update also requires an entity to present
separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change
in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair
value option for financial instruments. Additionally, this update eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and eliminates the requirement to
disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial
instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public entities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for our fiscal year
ending June 30, 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Share-based Compensation
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)." This standard
makes several modifications to Topic 718 related to the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based
compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the
statement of cash ﬂows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is eﬁective for us during the
first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing how the adoption
of this standard will impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)” (ASU 2016-02), which supersedes the guidance in
former ASC Topic 840 “Leases”. The most significant change will result in the recognition of lease assets for the right to use
the underlying asset and lease liabilities for the obligation to make lease payments by lessees, for those leases classified as
operating leases under current guidance. The new guidance will also require significant additional disclosures about the amount,
timing and uncertainty of cash ﬂows from leases. This standard is effective for us for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, with
early adoption permitted. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the
beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We believe adoption of this standard will
have a significant impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we have not completed our assessment, we do not
expect the adoption to change the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease expenses within the Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Cash Flows.
Income Taxes - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes” (ASU 2015-17). This update eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current
and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, under ASU 2015-17, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax
assets and liabilities as noncurrent. We have early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 on a retrospective
basis. Prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015 -17, the following adjustments
were made:
