Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Acquired customer-based intangible assets amortization expense increased by $5.0 million. This was primarily due to the
impact of new acquired customer-based intangible assets from our acquisitions of CEM Business, ANX, Daegis, Actuate and
IGC. This was partially oï¬‚iset by the customer-based intangible assets pertaining to previous acquisitions becoming fully
amortized.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Acquired customer-based intangible assets amortization expense increased by $27.2 million. This was primarily due to
our acquisitions of Actuate and IGC during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015 and GXS during the third quarter of Fiscal 2014,
offset by the customer-based intangible assets pertaining to previous acquisitions becoming fully amortized.
Special charges (recoveries):
Special charges typically relate to amounts that we expect to pay in connection with restructuring plans relating to
employee workforce reduction and abandonment of excess facilities, acquisition-related costs and other similar one-time
charges. Generally, we implement such plans in the context of integrating existing OpenText operations with that of acquired
entities. Actions related to such restructuring plans are typically completed within a period of one year. In certain limited
situations, if the planned activity does not need to be implemented, or an expense lower than anticipated is paid out, we record
a recovery of the originally recorded expense to Special charges.
