Worldwide adjusted operating income, which is intended to reﬂect the operational effectiveness of our leadership, is
calculated as total revenues less the total cost of revenues and operating expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets,
special charges and stock-based compensation expense. Worldwide adjusted operating income is also adjusted to remove the
impact of foreign exchange.
For Fiscal 2016, the following table illustrates the total short-term target awards for each Named Executive Officer, along
with the associated weighting of the related performance measures.

(1) In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Murphy was entitled to be paid 100% of his total target award for Fiscal
2016 only, irrespective of the Company ’5 performance. The total target award illustrated in the table above has been prorated based on Mr.
Murphy's date of hire with the Company in January 2016.
For the short-term incentive award amounts that would be earned at each of threshold, target and maximum levels of
performance, for applicable objectives, see “Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal 2016” below.
For each performance measure, the Compensation Committee approves the total target award, and the Board applies a
threshold and target level of performance. Where applicable, the Board also applies an objective formula for determining the
percentage payout under awards for levels of performance above and below threshold and target, although the Board reserves
the right in limited circumstances to make positive or negative adjustments if it considers them to be reasonably appropriate. To
the extent target performance is exceeded, the award will be proportionately greater. The threshold and target levels and payout
formula are set forth below as well as actual performance and payout percentages achieved in Fiscal 2016.
