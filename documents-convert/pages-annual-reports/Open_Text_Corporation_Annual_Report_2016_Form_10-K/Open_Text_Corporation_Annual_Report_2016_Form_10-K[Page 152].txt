Restructuring Plan charges relate to workforce reductions and facility consolidations. These charges require management to
make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated
liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a
quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as
apprOpriate.
As of June 30, 2016, we expect total costs to be incurred in conjunction with the Fiscal 2015 Restructuring Plan to be
approximately $32.0 to $35.0 million, of which $30.4 million has already been recorded within Special charges (recoveries) to
date. We do not expect to incur any further significant charges related to this plan.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown below.

Open Text/GXS Restructuring Plan
In the third quarter of Fiscal 2014 and in the context of the acquisition of GXS, we began to implement restructuring
activities to streamline our operations (OpenText/GXS Restructuring Plan). These charges relate to workforce reductions,
facility consolidations and other miscellaneous direct costs. These charges require management to make certain judgments and
estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change
subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct
an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate.
Since the inception of the plan $24.1 million has been recorded within Special charges. We do not expect to incur any
further significant charges related to this plan.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown below.
