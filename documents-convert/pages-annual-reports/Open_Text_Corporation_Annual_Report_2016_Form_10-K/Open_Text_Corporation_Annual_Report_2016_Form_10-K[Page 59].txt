Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Interest and other related expense, net increased by $21.7 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
This was primarily due to additional interest expense incurred relating to Senior Notes 2023 and to a lesser extent Senior Notes
2026, which were issued on May 31, 2016, offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the repayment of our Term
Loan A.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Interest and other related expense, net increased by $26.7 million. This was primarily the result of additional interest
expense incurred relating to Senior Notes 2023 and our Term Loan B, offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from
the repayment of our Term Loan A. Additionally, we received investment income of $2.3 million as part of income distributions
made from our cost basis investments. We receive such income distributions periodically and do not expect such income
distributions to be made regularly.

Praisiwfor I acmdaxes
We operate in several tax jurisdictions and are exposed to various foreign tax rates. We also note that we are subject to tax
rate discrepancies between our domestic tax rate and foreign tax rates that are significant and these discrepancies are primarily
related to earnings in Luxembourg.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
The effective tax rate (which is the provision for taxes expressed as a percentage of income before taxes) decreased to
2.2% for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to 11.9% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in tax expense of
$25.4 million was primarily the result of a decrease in valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets in the amount of
$41.6 million, offset by an increase in the effect of permanent differences in the amount of $9.4 million and tax filings in excess
of amounts previously recorded of $8.0 million. The remainder of the differences are due to normal course movements and
non-material items.
The decrease in the valuation allowance of $41.6 million is primarily attributable to the Company's reorganization of
intellectual property in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, as well as the integration of recently completed acquisitions, supporting
the assessment that the Company will more likely than not realize the value of certain deferred tax assets within a reasonable
timeframe. For more details see note 23 â€œSubsequent Events" to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
The effective tax rate (which is the provision for taxes expressed as a percentage of income before taxes) decreased to
11.9% for Fiscal 2015, from 21.1% for Fiscal 2014, resulting in a reduction of tax expense in the amount of $26.8 million. This
decrease was primarily the result of (i) a decrease in the net expense of unrecognized tax benefits with related interest and
penalties in the amount of $15.0 million, (ii) a decrease of $6.3 million in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, and (iii)
