Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are primarily exposed to market risks associated with ﬂuctuations in interest rates on our term loans and foreign
currency exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
Our exposure to interest rate ﬂuctuations relate primarily to our Term Loan B.
As of June 30, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $780.0 million on Term Loan B. Term Loan B bears a ﬂoating
interest rate of 2.5% plus the higher of LIBOR or 0.75%. As of June 30, 2016, an adverse change of one percent on the interest
rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on Term Loan B by approximately $7.8 million, assuming
that the loan balance as of June 30, 2016 is outstanding for the entire period.
At June 30, 2015, an adverse change of one percent would have had the effect of increasing our annual interest payments
on Term Loan B by approximately $7.9 million, assuming that the loan balance was outstanding for the entire period.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency transaction risk
We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany
fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term. We expect
that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures. Our ultimate realized gain or loss
with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we
enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates. Additionally, we have
hedged certain of our Canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in Canada.
Based on the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as at June 30, 2016, a one cent change in the Canadian
dollar to US. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of approximately $0.3 million in the mark to market on our
existing foreign exchange forward contracts.
At June 30, 2015, a one cent change in the Canadian dollar to US. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of
approximately $0.8 million in the mark to market on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts.
Foreign currency translation risk
Our reporting currency is the US. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and
liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into US. dollars. In particular, the
amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in US. dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these
subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each
respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets).
