Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 “Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
Adjustments” (ASU 2015-16). This update amended Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805 “Business
Combinations” to simplify the presentation of adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation identified during the
measurement period of a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the reporting period in which
the adjustment amounts are determined, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or their income effects,
if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition
date. An entity must present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount
recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 eliminates the requirement to
retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. During the third
quarter of Fiscal 2016 we early adopted ASU 2015-16. The early adoption of ASU 2015-16 did not have an impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements for this period.
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" (ASU 2015-03).
This update amended the ASC Subtopic 835-30, "Interest - Imputation of Interest" to simplify the presentation of debt issuance
costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement
guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. We early adopted ASU 2015-03 in the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 and reclassified $34.0 million and $30.6 million of debt issuance costs from Other assets to Long-
term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606” (ASU 2014-09)
and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in August 2015, March 2016, April 2016 and May 2016 within ASU
2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, respectively. These updates supersede the revenue recognition
requirements in ASC Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition" and nearly all other existing revenue recognition guidance under US.
GAAP. The core principal of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to
customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09
identifies five steps to be followed to achieve this core principal, which include (i) identifying contract(s) with customers, (ii)
identifying performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract(s) and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation. In August 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year. The new
guidance will now be effective for us in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Early adoption, prior to the
original effective date, is not permitted. When applying ASU 2014-09 we can either apply the amendments: (i) retrospectively
to each prior reporting period presented with the option to elect certain practical expedients as defined within ASU 2014-09 or
(ii) retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application and
providing certain additional disclosures as defined within ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the effect that the pending
adoption of the above mentioned ASUs will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Although it
is expected to have a significant impact on our revenue recognition policies and disclosures, we have not yet selected a
transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.
