million relating to deferred revenue. The changes in working capital were largely due to the increased scale of operations
resulting from our GXS acquisition.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 our Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 53 days the same as DSO of 53 days
during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2014 and the per day impact of our DSO in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal
2014 on our cash ﬂows was $3.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively.
Cash ﬂows used in investing activities
Our cash ﬂows used in investing activities is primarily on account of acquisitions and additions of property and
equipment.
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Cash ﬂows used in investing activities decreased by $37.2 million. This was primarily because we spent $33.9 million
less on acquisitions in Fiscal 2016 than we did in Fiscal 2015. We also spent $7.0 million less on additions of property and
equipment and $1.8 million less on other investing activities. These decreases were offset by in an inﬂow of investing cash
from the maturity of our short term investments of $5.8 million.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Cash ﬂows used in investing activities decreased by $755.0 million. This was primarily due to lower consideration for our
acquisitions made during Fiscal 2015 than for our acquisitions made during Fiscal 2014, and proceeds of $17.0 million
received from the maturity of short-term investments. These were partially oﬂ?set by incremental additions to property and
equipment of $34.8 million, and a $8.1 million increase in other investing activities.
Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities
Our cash ﬂows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock
options exercised by our employees. These inﬂows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our
long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or the repurchases of our Common Shares.
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Cash ﬂows provided by financing activities increased by $259.6 million. This was primarily due to the repayment of Term
Loan A which occurred in Fiscal 2015 (with no equivalent event in Fiscal 2016). The reduction in principal payments resulted
in a net positive inﬂow of $522.3 million. Additionally, debt issuance costs were lower which resulted in a positive inﬂow of
$11.5million and proceeds from the issuance of Common shares were higher by $4.9 million. These increases were partially
offset by (i) lower proceeds received from long term debt of $200 million, representing the diﬂ?erence between the $800 million
of Senior Notes 2023 issued in Fiscal 2015 and the $600 million of Senior Notes 2026 issued in Fiscal 2016, (ii) the repurchase
in Fiscal 2016 of approximately 1.5 million Common Shares for approximately $65.5 million under our Share Repurchase
Plan, and (iii) a $11.6 million increase in dividend payments made to our shareholders in Fiscal 2016. The remainder of the
change was due to miscellaneous items.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Cash ﬂows provided by financing activities decreased by $517.3 million. This was primarily due to the repayment of the
outstanding balances of our Term Loan A during the third quarter of Fiscal 2015 and of our mortgage during the fourth quarter
of Fiscal 2015. Additionally, we increased dividend payments to our shareholders by $12.9 million, we purchased Treasury
stock for potential reissuance under our current LTIP plans for $8.9 million, and we incurred approximately $2.0 million in
additional debt issuance costs.
Cash Dividends
In Fiscal 2016, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.83 per Common Share, that totaled $99.3 million. Future
declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination and
discretion of the Board. See Item 5 "Dividend Policy" for more information.
In Fiscal 2015, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.7175 per Common Share that totaled $87.6 million.
In Fiscal 2014, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.6225 per Common Share that totaled $74.7 million.
