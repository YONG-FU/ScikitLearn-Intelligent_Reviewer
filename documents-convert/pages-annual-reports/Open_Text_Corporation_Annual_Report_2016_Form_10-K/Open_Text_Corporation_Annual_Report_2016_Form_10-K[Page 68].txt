Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of balances with banks as well as deposits with original maturities of 90 days
or less.
We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, as well as available credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our
anticipated cash requirements for working capital, contractual commitments, capital expenditures, dividends, potential
acquisitions under our normal course issuer bid, and operating needs for the next 12 months. However, any further material or
acquisition-related activities may require additional sources of financing and would be subject to the financial covenants
established under our credit facilities. For more details, see "Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities" below.
As at June 30, 2016, we have provided $15.9 million (June 30, 2015—$12.1 million) in respect of both additional foreign
withholding taxes or deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain
non-United States subsidiaries, and planned periodic repatriations from certain United States and Luxembourg subsidiaries, that
will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution.
Cash ﬂows provided by operating activities
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Cash ﬂows from operating activities increased by $2.7 million due to an increase in net income before the impact of non-
cash items of $17 .0 million, partially offset by a decrease in changes from working capital of $14.3 million. The decrease in
operating cash ﬂow from changes in working capital of $14.3 million was primarily due to the net impact of the following
decreases: (i) $34.2 million relating to accounts receivable, and (ii) $11.5 million relating to deferred revenue. These decreases
were partially offset by increases of: (i) $17.0 million relating to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as a result of an
active working capital management program, (ii) $7.2 million relating to other assets, (iii) $3.8 million relating to prepaid and
other current assets, and (iv) $3.4 million relating to income taxes payable and deferred charges and credits.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 our Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 53 days, the same as during the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2015 and the per day impact of our DSO in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2015 on our cash
ﬂows was the same at $3.2 million for each period.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Cash ﬂows from operating activities increased by $105.9 million due to an increase in net income before the impact of
non-cash items of $73.7 million and an increase in changes from working capital of $32.2 million. The increase in operating
cash ﬂow from changes in working capital of $32.2 million was primarily due to the net impact of the following changes: (i)
$60.4 million relating to accounts receivable, (ii) $13.8 million relating to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and (iii) $0.8
million relating to other assets. These increases were offset by the net impact of the following changes: (i) $18.2 million
relating to income taxes and deferred charges and credits, (ii) $14.7 million due to prepaid and other current assets and (iii) $9.9
