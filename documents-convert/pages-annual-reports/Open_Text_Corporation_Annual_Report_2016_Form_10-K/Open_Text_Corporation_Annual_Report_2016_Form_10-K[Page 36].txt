Stock Purchases
No shares were repurchased during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On July 28, 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our Common Shares (Share
Repurchase Plan). Common Shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, private purchases through
forward, derivative, accelerated repurchase or automatic repurchase transactions or otherwise. Certain of our share repurchases
may from time to time be eﬁected through repurchase plans. The timing of any repurchases will depend on market conditions,
our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. During Fiscal 2016 we repurchased and cancelled
1,476,248 Common Shares for approximately $65.5 million under the Share Repurchase Plan. On July 26, 2016, our Board of
Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to $200 million of our Common Shares, pursuant to a
normal course issuer bid.
Stock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return
The following graph compares for each of the five fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 the yearly percentage change in the
cumulative total shareholder return on our Common Shares with the cumulative total return on:
- an index of companies in the software application industry (S&P North American Technology-Software Index);
- the NASDAQ Composite Index; and
- the S&P/TSX Composite Index.
Beginning in Fiscal 2016, we included the S&P North American Technology-Software Index to replace the previously
used Morningstar Application-Software Index (Morningstar Index), an index of companies in the software application industry,
which is exclusively maintained by Zack's Investment Research. The Morningstar Index will no longer be available to the
Company upon changing service providers. For comparative purposes, the graph below includes both the Morningstar Index as
well as the S&P North American Technology-Software Index.
The graph illustrates the cumulative return on a $100 investment in our Common Shares made on June 30, 2011, as
compared with the cumulative return on a $100 investment in the S&P North American Technology-Software Index, the
Morningstar Index, the NASDAQ Composite Index and the S&P/TSX Composite Index (the Indices) made on the same day.
Dividends declared on securities comprising the respective Indices and declared on our Common Shares are assumed to be
reinvested. The performance of our Common Shares as set out in the graph is based upon historical data and is not indicative
of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our Common Shares. The graph lines merely connect measurement dates
and do not reﬂect ﬂuctuations between those dates.
