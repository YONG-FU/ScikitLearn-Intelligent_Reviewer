Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Cloud services and subscriptions revenues decreased by $4.3 million, inclusive of the negative impact of foreign
exchange of approximately $19.4 million. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in Asia Pacific of

of Cloud services deals greater than $1.0 million that closed during Fiscal 2016 was 31 deals, compared to 31 deals in Fiscal
20 15.
Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $6.7 million, due to an increase in labour-related costs of
approximately $12.5 million, and an increase in sales tax liabilities of approximately $0.7 million resulting from the impact of
certain adjustments that occurred primarily in Fiscal 2015. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in third party
network usage fees of approximately $6.5 million. Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions
revenues decreased slightly to approximately 59% from approximately 61%.

3) Customer Support Revenues:
Customer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements. These
agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software
products when and if available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year
sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods.
Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from
period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, with customer renewal
options. Cost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as
third party royalty costs.
