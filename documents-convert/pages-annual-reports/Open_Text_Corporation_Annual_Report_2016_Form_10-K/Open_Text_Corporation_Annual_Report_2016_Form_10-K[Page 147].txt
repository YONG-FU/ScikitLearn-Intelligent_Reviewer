The decrease in the valuation allowance of $41.6 million is primarily attributable to the Company's reorganization of
intellectual property in the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, as well as the integration of recently completed acquisitions, supporting
the assessment that the Company will more likely than not realize the value of certain deferred tax assets within a reasonable
timeframe. For more details see note 23 â€œSubsequent Events".
We have approximately $53.3 million of domestic non-capital loss carryforwards. In addition, we have $621.8 million of
foreign non-capital loss carryforwards of which $63.2 million have no expiry date. The remainder of the domestic and foreign
losses expires between 2017 and 2036. In addition, investment tax credits of $45.9 million will expire between 2027 and 2036.

We believe that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets that a valuation

including but not limited to factors such as estimated taxable income, any historical experience of losses for tax purposes and
the future growth of OpenText.
The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) were as
