4) Professional Service and Other Revenues:
Professional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide
implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues. These
revenues are grouped within the “Professional service and other” category because they are relatively immaterial to our service
revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Cost of professional
service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to
our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and
third party subcontracting.
