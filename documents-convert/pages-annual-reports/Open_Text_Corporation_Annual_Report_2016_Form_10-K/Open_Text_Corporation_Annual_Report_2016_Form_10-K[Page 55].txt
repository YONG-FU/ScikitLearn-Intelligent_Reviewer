Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Research and development expenses decreased by $2.4 million, primarily due to a decrease in Contract labour and
consulting expenses of $1.7 million resulting from continued eﬁorts to reduce the usage of external services. Additionally,
payroll and payroll-related benefits decreased by $0.7 million and travel and communication expense decreased by $0.3
million. These were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in the use of facility and related resources. Overall, our research
and development expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, have remained stable at approximately 11%.
Our research and development labour resources increased by 93 employees, from 2,075 employees at June 30, 2015 to
2,168 employees at June 30, 2016. Included in this increase are 86 employees from acquisitions that occurred in the fourth
quarter of Fiscal 2016, which did not have a material impact on our research and development expenses in Fiscal 2016.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Research and development expenses increased by $19.7 million. Payroll and payroll-related benefits increased by $19.8
million and the use of facility and related resources increased by $3.9 million, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of GXS
in the third quarter of Fiscal 2014 and Actuate in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. These increases were partially oﬁset by a
decrease in contract labour and consulting expenses of $2.5 million, resulting from continued efforts to reduce the usage of
external services and replace them with internal resources, and a $1.5 million reduction in travel and communication expenses.
Overall, our research and development expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, have remained relatively stable at
approximately 11%.
Our research and development labour resources increased by 203 employees, from 1,872 employees at June 30, 2014 to
2,075 employees at June 30, 2015.
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and costs associated with advertising, marketing
