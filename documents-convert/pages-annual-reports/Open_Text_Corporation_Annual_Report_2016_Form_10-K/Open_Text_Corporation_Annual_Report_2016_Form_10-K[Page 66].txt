(1) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of share-based compensation expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as this expense is excluded
from our internal analysis of operating results.
(2) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of
amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.
(3) GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based gross profit stated in dollars and gross margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.
(4) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of Special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as Special charges (recoveries)
are generally incurred in the periods following the relevant acquisitions, include one-time, non-recurring charges or recoveries, and are not indicative
or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See note 17 "Special Charges
(Recoveries)" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
(5) GAAP-based and Non-GAAP-based income from operations stated in dollars and operating margin stated as a percentage of total revenue.
(6) Adjustment relates to the exclusion of Other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as Other income (expense) relates
primarily to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded
from our internal analysis of operating results.
(7) Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 21% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of 14.3%;
these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of expenses that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based adjusted net
income. Such excluded expenses include amortization, share-based compensation, Special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also
excluded are tax expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves,
tax arising on internal reorganizations, and “book to return” adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments (in total “adjusted expenses”). In
arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of 14.3%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory
tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.
