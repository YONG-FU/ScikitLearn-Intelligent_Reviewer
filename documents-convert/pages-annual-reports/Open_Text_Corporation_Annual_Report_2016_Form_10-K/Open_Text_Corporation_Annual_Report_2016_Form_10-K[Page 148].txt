Included in the above tabular reconciliation are unrecognized tax benefits of $23.5 million relating to deferred tax assets
in jurisdictions in which these deferred tax assets are offset with valuation allowances. The net unrecognized tax benefit
excluding these deferred tax assets is $150.9 million as of June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015—$155 .1 million).

We believe that it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of June 30, 2016, could decrease tax
expense in the next 12 months by $3.8 million, relating primarily to the expiration of competent authority relief and tax years
becoming statute barred for purposes of future tax examinations by local taxing jurisdictions.
Our four most significant tax jurisdictions are Canada, the United States, Luxembourg and Germany. Our tax filings
remain subject to audits by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings
relate. The earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008 for Germany, 2010 for the United States, 2011 for Luxembourg,
and 2012 for Canada.
We are subject to tax audits in all major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and currently have tax audits open in
Canada, the United States, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands and Japan. On a quarterly basis we assess the status of
these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other
taxes. Statements regarding the United States audits are included in note 13.
The timing of the resolution of income tax audits is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon
resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that
within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of
income tax audits in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our
contingencies related to positions on tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the
ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. For
more information relating to certain tax audits, please refer to note 13.
