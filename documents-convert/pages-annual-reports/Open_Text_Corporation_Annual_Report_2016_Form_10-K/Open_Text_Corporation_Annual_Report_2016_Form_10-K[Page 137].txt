Term Loan B has a seven year term and repayments made under Term Loan B are equal to 0.25% of the original principal
amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of Term Loan B, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under Term
Loan B currently bear a ﬂoating rate of interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.5% plus the higher of LIBOR or 0.75%.
For the year ended June 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $25.9 million, relating to Term Loan B (year ended
June 30, 2015—$26.1 million; June 30, 2014—$11.9 million).
Revolver
We currently have a $300 million committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver). Borrowings under the Revolver are
secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, and on a pari passu basis with Term Loan B. The Revolver will
mature on December 22, 2019 with no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. As of June 30, 2016, we have not
drawn any amounts on the Revolver.

Defined Beneﬁt Plans
CDT Plan
CDT sponsors an unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all CDT employees (CDT pension plan)
which provides for old age, disability and survivors’ benefits. Benefits under the CDT pension plan are generally based on age
at retirement, years of service and the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of this pension plan is determined
using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and
estimated service costs. No contributions have been made since the inception of the plan. Actuarial gains or losses in excess of
10% of the projected benefit obligation are being amortized and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs over
the average remaining service period of the plan's active employees. As of June 30, 2016, there is approximately $0.6 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income related to the CDT pension plan that is expected to be recognized as a component of
net periodic benefit costs over the next fiscal year.
GXS Germany Plan
As part of our acquisition of GXS, we acquired an unfunded defined benefit pension plan covering certain German
employees which provides for old age, disability and survivors' benefits. The GXS GER plan has been closed to new
participants since 2006. Benefits under the GXS GER plan are generally based on a participant’s remuneration, date of hire,
