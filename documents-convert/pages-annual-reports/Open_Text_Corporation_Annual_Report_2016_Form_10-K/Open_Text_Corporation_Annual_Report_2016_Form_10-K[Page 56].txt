Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $29.4 million. This was primarily due to a $15.7 million decrease in payroll
and payroll-related benefits, a $6.6 million decrease in commissions expense that is primarily in connection with lower
revenues, a $5.0 million decrease in travel and communication expenses, and a $3.3 million decrease in marketing expenses.
These decreases were partially oﬁset by a $2.1 million increase in share-based compensation expense. Overall, our sales and
marketing expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased slightly to approximately 19% from approximately 20%.
Our sales and marketing labour resources decreased by 36 employees, from 1,478 employees at June 30, 2015 to 1,442
employees at June 30, 2016. Absent the impact of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016, our sales and marketing
labour resources decreased by 99 employees. The addition of 63 employees in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016 from recent
acquisitions did not have a material impact on our sales and marketing expenses in Fiscal 2016.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $26.7 million. This was due to a $10.6 million increase in payroll and payroll-
related benefits, primarily as a result of our acquisitions of GXS and Actuate, and a $9.8 million increase in commission
benefits resulting from the increase in total revenues. Additionally, marketing expenses increased by $2.3 million, primarily on
account of promotional activity for our global "sales kick off” event held during the first quarter of Fiscal 2015 and our annual
user conference held during the second quarter of Fiscal 2015 and other miscellaneous expenses increased primarily due to an
increase in bad debt expense of $2.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in travel and
communication expenses. Overall, our sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased to
approximately 20% from approximately 21% in Fiscal 2014.
Our sales and marketing labour resources increased by 83 employees, from 1,395 employees at June 30, 2014 to 1,478
employees at June 30, 2015.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and payroll related benefits expenses, related overhead,
audit fees, other professional fees, consulting expenses and public company costs.
