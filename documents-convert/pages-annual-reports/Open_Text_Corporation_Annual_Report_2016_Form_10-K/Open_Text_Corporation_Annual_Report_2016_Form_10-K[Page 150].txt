Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the derivative instruments, the counterparty to which has high
credit ratings, were derived from pricing models including discounted cash ﬂow techniques, with all significant inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data, as no quoted market prices exist for these instruments. Our discounted cash
ﬂow techniques use observable market inputs, such as, where applicable, foreign currency spot and forward rates.
Our cash and cash equivalents, along with our accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances,
are measured and recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements at an amount that approximates their fair value (a Level
2 measurement) due to their short maturities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets are recognized at fair value when they are
deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, no indications of impairment
were identified and therefore no fair value measurements were required.
If applicable, we will recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period
in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. During the years June 30, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any
transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are classified as available for sale securities and are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets
at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
A summary of our short-term investments outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

NOTE 16—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGIN G ACTIVITIES
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
We are engaged in hedging programs with relationship banks to limit the potential foreign exchange ﬂuctuations incurred
on future cash ﬂows relating to a portion of our Canadian dollar payroll expenses. We operate internationally and are therefore
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations in the normal course of our business, in particular to changes in the
Canadian dollar on account of large costs that are incurred from our centralized Canadian operations, which are denominated in
Canadian dollars. As part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge portions of our
payroll exposure with typical maturities of between one and twelve months. We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
We have designated these transactions as cash ﬂow hedges of forecasted transactions under ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives
and Hedging” (Topic 815). As the critical terms of the hedging instrument, and of the entire hedged forecasted transaction, are
the same, in accordance with Topic 815 we have been able to conclude that changes in fair value or cash ﬂows attributable to
the risk being hedged are expected to completely oﬁset at inception and on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, quarterly unrealized
gains or losses on the effective portion of these forward contracts have been included within other comprehensive income. The
fair value of the contracts, as of June 30, 2016, is recorded within "Prepaid expenses and other current assets”.
As of June 30, 2016, the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell US. dollars in exchange for Canadian
dollars was $33.2 million (June 30, 2015—$76.4 million).
