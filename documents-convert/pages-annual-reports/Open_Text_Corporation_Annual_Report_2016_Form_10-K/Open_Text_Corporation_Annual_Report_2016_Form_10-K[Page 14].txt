related to how information is handled and protected;
(ii) Improved operating efficiency through process digitization and automation;
(iii) Better customer engagement through improved and integrated digital experiences and content delivery;
(iv) Lower cost of storage and management of information through improved classification and archiving strategies;

and hosted services deployment models;

customers work with information and collaborate in ways which are intuitive, automated, and ﬂexible; and

Release 16 helps organizations with their digital transformation by digitizing information, experiences, processes and
supply chains, to create a better way to work within their enterprise. Release 16 also has a major focus on analysis and
reporting across all product lines and use cases. It offers customers a coordinated platform for digital transformation that is
intended to yield the benefits of scale and single-vendor interaction. We have made significant investments to our cloud
infrastructure over the past couple of years, and now with Release 16 virtually all of our products are available in the
"OpenText Cloud".
Our portfolio is comprised of capabilities in the following areas:
Enterprise Content Management
We facilitate ECM with an integrated set of technologies that manage information throughout its lifecycle and improve
business productivity, all while mitigating the risk and controlling the costs of growing volumes of content. Our ECM
solutions, which are available on-premises and increasingly in the cloud, include:
° Content Management provides a repository for business documents (such as those created with Microsoft Office,
AutoCAD and Adobe Acrobat/PDF) and allows for the organizing, displaying, classifying, access control, version
control, event auditing, rendition, and search of documents and other content types.
- Records Management enables control of the complete lifecycle of content management by associating retention and
disposition rules to control if and when content can or must be deleted or archived on storage media.
- Archiving helps reduce storage expenses through optimization of storage use. It manages content storage policies
according to business context, optimizes storage use, and provides high-end storage services to reduce future storage
demands.
