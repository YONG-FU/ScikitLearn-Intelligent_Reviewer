Guarantees and Indemnifications
We have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third party
claims that our software products or services infringe certain third party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to
a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification
provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Occasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including,
among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such
agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash ﬂows.
Litigation
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.
Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be
treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 "Loss
Contingencies" (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the
status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim
that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each
matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.
If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably
estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on
Form lO-K, the aggregate of such estimated losses were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of
operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts
already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
