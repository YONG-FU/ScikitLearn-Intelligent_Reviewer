Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015
Special charges increased by $22.0 million. This was primarily due to (i) an increase of $8.5 million relating to costs incurred
for a one-time ERP implementation project in which we are involved, (ii) an increase of $6.7 million relating to a lower net impact
of reversals from certain pre-acquisition sales and use tax liabilities and interest being settled, or in certain instances, becoming
statute barred, in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year, (iii) a net increase in restructuring charges of $4.1 million, (iv)
an increase in acquisition related costs of $3.2 million, and (v) an increase of $4.8 million relating to post-acquisition integration
costs necessary to streamline an acquired company into our operations and costs incurred to reorganize certain legal entities
including consolidation of intellectual property. These increases were partially offset by (i) a decrease of $2.9 million relating to
the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of a $600 million credit facility (Term Loan A)in
the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, and (ii) a $2.1 million decrease related to post-business combination compensation obligations
associated with the acquisition of Actuate in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015. The remainder of the change is due to miscellaneous
items.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014

Other expense included foreign exchange losses of $1.9 million on our inter-company transactions during Fiscal 2016
compared to $31.0 million in foreign exchange losses during Fiscal 2015. The remainder of the change is primarily due to a
