As at June 30, 2016, we have provided $15.9 million (June 30, 2015—$12.1 million) in respect of both additional foreign
withholding taxes or deferred income tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain
non-United States subsidiaries, and planned periodic repatriations from certain United States and Luxembourg subsidiaries, that
will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution. We have not provided for additional foreign withholding taxes or
deferred income tax liabilities related to undistributed earnings of all other non-Canadian subsidiaries, since such earnings are
considered permanently invested in those subsidiaries, or are not subject to withholding taxes. It is not practicable to reasonably
estimate the amount of additional deferred income tax liabilities or foreign withholding taxes that may be payable should these
earnings be distributed in the future.
NOTE 15—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” (Topic 820) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and addresses disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received upon
sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value, in this context, should be
calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions speciﬁc
to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own
credit risk.
In addition to defining fair value and addressing disclosure requirements, Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for
valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair
value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
- Level 1—inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
- Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or
similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.
- Level 3—inputs are generally unobservable and typically reﬂect management’s estimates of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based
techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash ﬂow models, and similar techniques.

*These assets in the table above are classified as Level 2 as certain specific assets included within may not have quoted
prices that are readily accessible in an active market or we may have relied on alternative pricing methods that do not rely
exclusively on quoted prices to determine the fair value of the investments.
