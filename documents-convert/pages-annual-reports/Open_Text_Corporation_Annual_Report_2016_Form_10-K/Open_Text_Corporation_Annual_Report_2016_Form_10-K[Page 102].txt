Change in Control
If there is a change in control of the Company and within one year of such change in control event, there is a change in
the relationship between the Company and the Named Executive Officer without the Named Executive Officer's written

Board was not approved by a majority of the Board still in office at the beginning of such period.
Examples of a change in the relationship between the Named Executive Officer and the Company where payments or
benefits may be triggered following a change in control event include:
- A material diminution in the duties and responsibilities of the Named Executive Oﬂicer, other than (a) a change
arising solely out of the Company becoming part of a larger organization following the change in control event or any
related change in the reporting hierarchy or (b) a reorganization of the Company resulting in similar changes to the
duties and responsibilities of similarly situated executive officers;
