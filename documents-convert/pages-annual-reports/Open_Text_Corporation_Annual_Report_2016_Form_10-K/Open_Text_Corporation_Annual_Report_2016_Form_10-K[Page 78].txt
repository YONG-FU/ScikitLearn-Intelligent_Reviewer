assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any evaluation of prospective control effectiveness, with respect
to future periods, is subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
