Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014
License revenues decreased by $11.6 million inclusive of a negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $20.2
million. Geographically, the overall decrease was attributable to a decrease in Asia Pacific of $6.7 million, a decrease in
Americas of $6.3 million, offset by an increase in EMEA of $1 .4 million. The number of license deals greater than $0.5 million
that closed during Fiscal 2015 was 78 deals, compared to 77 deals in Fiscal 2014. License revenue, as a proportion of our total
revenues, decreased from 18.8% in Fiscal 2014 to 15.9% in Fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of an increasing proportion in
cloud services and subscriptions revenues.
Cost of license revenues were relatively stable, with gross margin percentage remaining at approximately 96%.
2) Cloud Services and Subscriptions:
Cloud services and subscription revenues consist of (i) software as a service offerings (ii) managed service arrangements
and (iii) subscription revenues relating to on premise oﬁerings. These offerings allow our customers to make use of OpenText
software, services and content over Internet enabled networks supported by OpenText data centers. These web applications
allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information
without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure. Revenues are generated on several transactional usage-
based models, are typically billed monthly in arrears, and can therefore ﬂuctuate from period to period. Certain service fees are
occasionally charged to customize hosted software for some customers and are either amortized over the estimated customer
life, in the case of setup fees, or recognized in the period they are provided.
In addition, we offer business-to-business (B2B) integration solutions, such as messaging services, and managed services.
Messaging services allow for the automated and reliable exchange of electronic transaction information, such as purchase
orders, invoices, shipment notices and other business documents, among businesses worldwide. Managed services provide an
end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational
management, and customer support. These services enable customers to effectively manage the ﬂow of electronic transaction
information with their trading partners and reduce the complexity of disparate standards and communication protocols.
Revenues are primarily generated through transaction processing. Transaction processing fees are recurring in nature and are
recognized on a per transaction basis in the period in which the related transactions are processed. Revenues from contracts
with monthly, quarterly or annual minimum transaction levels are recognized based on the greater of the actual transactions or
the specified contract minimum amounts during the relevant period. Customers who are not committed to multi-year contracts
generally are under contracts for transaction processing solutions that automatically renew every month or year, depending on
the terms of the specific contracts.
Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third party network usage fees, maintenance
of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs, amortization of customer set up and
implementation costs, and some third party royalty costs.
