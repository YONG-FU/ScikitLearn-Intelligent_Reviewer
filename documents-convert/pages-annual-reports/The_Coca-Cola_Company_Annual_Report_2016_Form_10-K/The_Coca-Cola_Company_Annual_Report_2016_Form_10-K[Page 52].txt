The percentage contribution of each operating segment ﬂuctuates over time due to net operating revenues in certain operating
segments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by
sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency ﬂuctuations. For
additional information about the impact of foreign currency ﬂuctuations, refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and
Financial Position — Foreign Exchange" below.
Gross Proﬁt Margin
As a result of our finished goods operations, which are primarily included in our North America and Bottling Investments
operating segments, the following inputs represent a substantial portion of the Company's total cost of goods sold:
(1) sweeteners, (2) metals, (3) juices and (4) PET. The Company enters into hedging activities related to certain commodities in
order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments
used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures, including any related foreign currency
exposure, do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been,
and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related
to these derivatives of $79 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 and losses of $206 million and $8 million during
the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of
income. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not currently expect changes in commodity
costs to have a significant impact on our 2017 gross profit margin as compared to 2016.
Year Ended December 31, 2016 versus Year Ended December 31, 2015
Our gross profit margin increased to 60.7 percent in 2016 from 60.5 percent in 2015. The increase was primarily due to the
impact of positive price mix and lower commodity costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
exchange rate ﬂuctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
Year Ended December 31, 2015 versus Year Ended December 31, 2014
Our gross profit margin decreased to 60.5 percent in 2015 from 61.1 percent in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the
impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, partially
offset by positive price mix and slightly lower commodity costs. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.
