The following table presents the diﬁerence between calculated fair values, based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded
shares, and our Company's cost basis in investments in publicly traded companies accounted for under the equity method (in
millions):

1 The carrying value of our investment in CCEP exceeded its fair value as of December 31, 2016. Based on the length of time and the extent
to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and
ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined
that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge.
Other Assets
Our Company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and
increasing unit case volume. Additionally, our Company advances payments to certain customers for distribution rights as well
as to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the periods
benefited. Payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported in the line items prepaid expenses and other
assets or other assets, as appropriate, in our consolidated balance sheets. When facts and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of these assets or asset groups may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying
value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross proﬁt and cash ﬂows. These estimated future cash ﬂows
are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash ﬂows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is
the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, was $10,635 million, or
12 percent of our total assets. Certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying
amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among others, the manner or
length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the
business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash ﬂow loss combined with historical losses or
projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and an impairment review is performed, we
estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These
estimated future cash ﬂows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash
ﬂows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of
methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash ﬂow
models, which are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use.
