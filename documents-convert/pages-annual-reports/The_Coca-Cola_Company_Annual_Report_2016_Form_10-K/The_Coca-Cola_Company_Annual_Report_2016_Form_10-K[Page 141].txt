NOTE 21: SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In the first quarter of 20 17, additional bottling territories in North America met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Therefore, we are required to record the related assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to
sell based on the estimated selling prices, which will result in an estimated total loss of $9 million. The Company expects these
territories to be refranchised during 2017. Refer to Note 2 for additional information about North America refranchising.
