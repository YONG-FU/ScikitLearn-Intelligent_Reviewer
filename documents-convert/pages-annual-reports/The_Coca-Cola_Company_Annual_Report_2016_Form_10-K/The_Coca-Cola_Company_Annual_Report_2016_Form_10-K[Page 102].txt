The Company also uses fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of certain available-for—sale
securities from ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair
value hedges and the oﬁsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reﬂected in earnings as ineffectiveness. The total notional values of
derivatives that related to our fair value hedges of this type were $1,163 million and 582,15 9 million as of December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
The following table summarizes the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges
had on earnings during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):

Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy
The Company uses forward contracts and non-derivative financial instruments to protect the value of our net investments in a
number of foreign operations. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company designated a portion of its
euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a net investment in our European operations. The change in the carrying value of the
designated portion of the euro-denominated debt due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is recorded in net foreign
currency translation adjustment, a component of AOCI. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of
net investments in foreign operations, the changes in fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in net foreign
currency translation adjustment, to oﬁset the changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. Any ineffective
portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the period of change.
