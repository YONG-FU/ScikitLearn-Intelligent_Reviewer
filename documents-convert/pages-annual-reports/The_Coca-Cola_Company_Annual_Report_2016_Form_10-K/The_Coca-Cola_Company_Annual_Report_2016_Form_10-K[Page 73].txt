Commodity Prices
The Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price ﬂuctuations, principally related to our purchases of
sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier
pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and
distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity
risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the
Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel
used to operate our extensive vehicle ﬂeet.
Open commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $12 million and $8 million as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net
unrealized loss of $1 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a
10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have increased the net unrealized loss to $2 million.
Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $447 million and $893 million as
of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting resulted
in a net unrealized gain of $11 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming
a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have eliminated the net unrealized gain and created a net
unrealized loss of $28 million.
