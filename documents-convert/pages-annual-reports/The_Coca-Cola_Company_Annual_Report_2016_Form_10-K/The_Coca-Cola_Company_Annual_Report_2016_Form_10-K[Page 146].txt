1 The sum of the quarterly net income per share amounts does not agree to the full year net income per share amounts. We calculate net
income per share based on the weighted-average number of outstanding shares during the reporting period. The average number of shares
ﬂuctuates throughout the year and can therefore produce a full year result that does not agree to the sum of the individual quarters.
Our first quarter, second quarter and third quarter reporting periods end on the Friday closest to the last day of the applicable
quarterly calendar period. Our fourth quarter and ﬁscal year end on December 31 regardless of the day of the week on which
December 31 falls.
