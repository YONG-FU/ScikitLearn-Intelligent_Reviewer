In 2016 and 2015, the Company had investments classified as available-for—sale securities in which our cost basis exceeded the
fair value of our investment. Management assessed each of these investments on an individual basis to determine if the decline
in fair value was other than temporary. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among
other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time suﬁicient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. As a result of these assessments, management determined that the decline
in fair value of these investments was not other than temporary and did not record any impairment charges.
The Company uses insurance captives to reinsure group annuity insurance contracts that cover the pension obligations of
certain of our European and Canadian pension plans. In accordance with local insurance regulations, our insurance captive is
required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements. The Company elected to invest its solvency capital in a
portfolio of available-for—sale securities, which have been classified in the line item other assets in our consolidated balance
sheets because the assets are not available to satisfy our current obligations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's
available-for—sale securities included solvency capital funds of $985 million and $804 million, respectively.
