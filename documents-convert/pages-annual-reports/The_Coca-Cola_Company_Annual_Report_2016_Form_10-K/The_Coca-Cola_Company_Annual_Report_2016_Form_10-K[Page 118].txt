1 The Company has elected to use the actual fair value of plan assets as the market—related value of assets in the determination of the
expected return on plan assets.
2 Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using a corridor approach. The gain/loss corridor is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
obligation and the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future
working lifetime of the plan participants.
3 The settlement charge and special termination benefits are primarily related to the Company's North America refranchising and
productivity, restructuring and integration initiatives. Refer to Note 2 and Note 18.
