NOTE 3: INVESTMENTS
Investments in debt and marketable securities, other than investments accounted for under the equity method, are classified as
trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Our marketable equity investments are classified as either trading or available-
for—sale with their cost basis determined by the specific identification method. Our investments in debt securities are carried at
either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as
held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for—sale. Realized and unrealized gains and
losses on trading securities and realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net income. Unrealized
gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, on available-for—sale securities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as a
component of AOCI, except for the change in fair value attributable to the currency risk being hedged. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information related to the Company's fair value hedges of available-for—sale securities.
