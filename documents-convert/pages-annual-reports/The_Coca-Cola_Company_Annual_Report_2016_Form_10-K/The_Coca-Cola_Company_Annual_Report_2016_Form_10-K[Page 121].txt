Multi-Employer Pension Plans
As a result of our acquisition of Old CCE'S North America business in 2010, the Company now participates in various multi-
employer pension plans in the United States. Multi-employer pension plans are designed to cover employees from multiple
employers and are typically established under collective bargaining agreements. These plans allow multiple employers to pool
their pension resources and realize efficiencies associated with the daily administration of the plan.
Multiâ€”employer plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of management and labor representatives and are
funded through employer contributions.
The Company's expense for US. multi-employer pension plans totaled $41 million, $40 million and $38 million in 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively. The plans we currently participate in have contractual arrangements that extend into 2021. If, in the
future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer pension plans in which we currently participate, we would need
to record the appropriate withdrawal liabilities at that time.
