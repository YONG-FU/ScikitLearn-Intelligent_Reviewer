In February 2014, the Company announced the expansion of our productivity and reinvestment program to drive incremental
productivity by 2016 that will primarily be redirected into increased media investments. Our incremental productivity goal
consists of two relatively equal components. First, we will expand savings through global supply chain optimization, data and
information technology systems standardization, and resource and cost reallocation. Second, we will increase the effectiveness
of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer—
facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.
In October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and
extending it through 2019. The expansion of the productivity initiatives will focus on four key areas: restructuring the
Company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles, across the
organization; streamlining and simplifying the Company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and
efficiency in direct marketing investments.
The Company has incurred total pretax expenses of $2,408 million related to this program since it commenced. These expenses
were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 19 for the impact
these charges had on our operating segments. Outside services reported in the table below primarily relate to expenses in
connection with legal, outplacement and consulting activities. Other direct costs reported in the table below include, among
other items, internal and external costs associated with the development, communication, administration and implementation of
these initiatives; accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets; contract termination fees; and relocation costs.
The following table summarizes the balance of accrued expenses related to these productivity and reinvestment initiatives and
the changes in the accrued amounts since the commencement of the plan (in millions):

Integration Initiatives
Integration OfOur German Bottling Operations
In 2008, the Company began an integration initiative related to our German bottling operations acquired in 2007. The Company
incurred $240 million, $292 million and $208 million of expenses related to this initiative in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
and has incurred total pretax expenses of $1,367 million related to this initiative since it commenced. These expenses were
recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income and impacted the Bottling
Investments operating segment. The expenses recorded in connection with these integration activities have been primarily due
to involuntary terminations. The Company had $122 million accrued related to these integration costs as of December 31, 2015.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company deconsolidated our German bottling operations. Therefore, there was
no remaining accrual balance as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on the deconsolidation of
our German bottling operations.
