for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers' credit ratings were to decline, the
Company's equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.
We monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings.
Each rating agency employs a diﬁerent aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios.
These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.
Our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to raise
funds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt and
our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in
conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.
Issuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. In 2016, the Company had

with maturities of 90 days or less and $21,525 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than
90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $4,983 million, net of related

commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $2,695 million.
In 2015, the Company had issuances of debt of $40,434 million, which included net issuances of $25,923 million of
commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also

paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $31,711 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term
debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt payments of $5,8 19 million. The long-term debt payments
included the extinguishment of $2,039 million of long-term debt prior to maturity, which resulted in associated charges of
$320 million that were recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges
included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the
impact of the related fair value hedging relationship.
In 2014, the Company had issuances of debt of $41,674 million, which included net issuances of $3 17 million of commercial
paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less and $37,799 million of issuances of commercial paper and short—
term debt with maturities greater than 90 days. The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of

The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from Old CCE
of $361 million and $411 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These fair value adjustments are being
amortized over the number of years remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted-
average maturity of the assumed debt to which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 21 years. The
amortization of these fair value adjustments will be a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result
in our interest expense being less than the actual interest paid to service the debt. Total interest paid was $663 million,
$515 million and $498 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information related to the Company's long-term debt balances.
