recognize any changes in the fair value of certain equity investments in net income. These changes are currently recognized in
other comprehensive income ("OCI").
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-
use asset, representing their right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms
greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount,
timing and uncertainty of cash ﬂows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modiﬁed retrospective transition
approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for the Company beginning January 1, 2019 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-
Basea’ PaymentAccounting. The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation
arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash ﬂows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and will require us to prospectively recognize excess tax beneﬁts and tax
deficiencies in the consolidated statement of income when the awards vest or are settled. These changes are currently
recognized in capital surplus in our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the guidance requires excess tax benefits to be
presented as an operating activity in the statement of cash ﬂows rather than as a financing activity.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2020 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have
on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers ofAssets Other Than Inventory, which requires the
Company to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the
transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 is eﬁective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and will be applied using a modified
retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial
statements.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash. The amendments in this update address diversity in
practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash and require that a statement of cash ﬂows
explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or
restricted cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is eﬁective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and is required to be applied
using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU
2016-18 will have on our consolidated cash ﬂows.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Deﬁnition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a
business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as
acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is required to be applied prospectively and will be effective for
the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The impact on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the facts and
circumstances of any specific future transactions.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other, which eliminates the requirement to
calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. ASU 2017-04 is required to be applied
prospectively and the Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2017-04 effective January 1, 2017. We do not anticipate that the
adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
