Share Repurchases
In 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 500 million shares of the Company's common
stock. The table below presents annual shares repurchased and average price per share:
iYear Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 7
Number of shares repurchased (in millions) 86 86 98
Average price per share $ 43.62 $ 41.33 $ 40.97 7
Since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in 1984 through our current program as of December 31, 2016, we
have purchased 3.4 billion shares of our Company's common stock at an average price per share of $ 16.08. In addition to shares
repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company's treasury stock activity
also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in
connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to
employees. In 2016, we repurchased $3.7 billion of our stock. The net impact of the Company's treasury stock issuance and
purchase activities in 2016 resulted in a net cash outﬂow of $2.2 billion. We currently expect to repurchase approximately
$2.0 billion of our stock during 2017, net of proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock due to the exercise of employee stock
options.
Dividends
The Company paid dividends of $6,043 million, $5,741 million and $5,350 million during the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.
At its February 2017 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 6 percent, raising it to $0.37 per
share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.48 per share in 2017. This is our 55th consecutive annual increase. Our annual
common stock dividend was $1.40 per share, $1.32 per share and $1.22 per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
2016 dividend represented a 6 percent increase from 2015, and the 2015 dividend represented an 8 percent increase from 2014.
Off-Balance SheetArrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
Oﬂ-Balance SheetArrangementS
In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:
- any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;
- a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as
credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;
- any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and
- any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and
development services with the registrant.
As of December 31, 2016, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $587 million, of
which $247 million was related to VIEs. These guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers, vendors and
container manufacturing operations and have arisen through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various
terms, and none of these guarantees was individually significant. The amount represents the maximum potential future
payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees; however, we do not consider it probable that we will be
required to satisfy these guarantees. Management concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our
Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December 31, 2016, we were not directly liable for the debt of any
unconsolidated entity, and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.
Our Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to
Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
