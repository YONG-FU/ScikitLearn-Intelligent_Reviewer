Debt Financing
Our Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash ﬂows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of
debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity.
This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.
As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt was rated "AA-" by Standard & Poor's, "Aa3" by Moody's and "A+" by Fitch.
Our commercial paper program was rated "A-1+" by Standard & Poor's, "P- 1 " by Moody's and "F1" by Fitch. In assessing our
credit strength, all three agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and
ﬁnancial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some
rating agencies also consider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Amatil Limited,
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation
for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company's business
model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies
will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure,
our major bottlers' financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies' methodology in assessing our credit strength, or
