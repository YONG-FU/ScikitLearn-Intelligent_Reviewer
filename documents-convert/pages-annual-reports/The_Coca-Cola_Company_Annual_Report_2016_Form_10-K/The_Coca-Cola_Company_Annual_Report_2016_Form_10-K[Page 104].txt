NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS
Our consolidated net income includes our Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method
investees. When we record our proportionate share of net income, it increases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated
statements of income and our carrying value in that investment. Conversely, when we record our proportionate share of a net
loss, it decreases equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in that
investment. The Company's proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees includes significant
operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity method investees. These items can have a significant impact on the
amount of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income and our carrying value in those investments.
Refer to Note 17 for additional information related to signiﬁcant operating and nonoperating items recorded by our equity
method investees. The carrying values of our equity method investments are also impacted by our proportionate share of items
impacting the equity investee's AOCI.
We eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany portion of
transactions with equity method investees.
The Company's equity method investments include our ownership interests in Coca-Cola F EMSA, Coca-Cola Hellenic,
Coca-Cola Amatil Limited, CCEP and Monster. As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 28 percent, 23 percent,
29 percent, 18 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of these companies' outstanding shares. As of December 31, 2016, our
investment in our equity method investees in the aggregate exceeded our proportionate share of the net assets of these equity
method investees by $6,792 million. This diﬁerence is not amortized.
