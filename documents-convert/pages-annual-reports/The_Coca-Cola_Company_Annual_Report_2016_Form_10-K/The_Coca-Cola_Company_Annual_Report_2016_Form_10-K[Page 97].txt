to call or prepay certain obligations.
Cost Method Investments
Cost method investments are initially recorded at cost, and we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared.
Cost method investments are reported as other investments in our consolidated balance sheets, and dividend income from cost
method investments is reported in other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. We review all of our
cost method investments quarterly to determine if impairment indicators are present; however, we are not required to determine
the fair value of these investments unless impairment indicators exist. When impairment indicators exist, we generally use
discounted cash ﬂow analyses to determine the fair value. We estimate that the fair values of our cost method investments
approximated or exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. Our cost method investments had a
carrying value of $140 million and $190 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
NOTE 4: INVENTORIES
Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods

ﬁrst-out methods. Inventories consisted of the following (in millions):
