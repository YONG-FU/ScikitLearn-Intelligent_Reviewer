Unit Case Volume
The Coca-Cola system sold 29.3 billion, 29.2 billion and 28.6 billion unit cases of our products in 2016, 2015 and 20 14,
respectively. The unit case volume for 20 16, 2015 and 2014 reﬂects the impact of brands acquired and licensed during the
applicable year. The unit case volume for 2016, 2015 and 2014 reﬂects the impact of the transfer of distribution rights with
respect to non-Company-owned brands that were previously licensed to us in North American bottling territories that have
since been refranchised. The unit case volume in 2015 and 2014 reﬂects the discontinuance of certain brands owned by our
Russian juice company in connection with the transition in 2014 of our Russian juice operations to an existing joint venture
with an unconsolidated bottling partner (for information about these structural changes, refer to the heading "Operations
Review — Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands" above). The Company eliminated the unit case
volume related to these structural changes from the base year, as applicable, when calculating 2016 versus 2015 and 2015
versus 2014 unit case volume growth rates.

attributable to sparkling beverages and 27 percent to still beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent of non-

volume in sparkling beverages. The group's sparkling beverage performance included a 1 percent decline in Trademark
Coca-Cola, offset by an increase of 4 percent in Trademark Sprite and an increase of 1 percent in Trademark Fanta. The

juices and juice drinks. The group reported increases in unit case volume in our Western Europe, Middle East & North Africa,
West Africa and South & East Africa business units. The increases in these business units were partially oﬁset by declines in
unit case volume in both our Central & Eastern Europe and Turkey, Caucasus & Central Asia business units.
