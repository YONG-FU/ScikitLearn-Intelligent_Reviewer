Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Prior to the release date, time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units granted from the 2014 Equity Plan do not entitle
participants to vote or receive dividends and will be forfeited in the event of the recipient's termination of employment, except
for reasons such as death or disability. Certain other time-based restricted stock awards entitle participants to vote and receive
dividends, while for certain other time-based restricted stock units, participants may receive payment of dividend equivalents
but are not allowed to vote. The fair value of the restricted stock and restricted stock units expected to vest and be released is
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding nonvested
time-based restricted stock, including restricted stock units, of 770,244, most of which do not pay dividends or have voting
rights.
