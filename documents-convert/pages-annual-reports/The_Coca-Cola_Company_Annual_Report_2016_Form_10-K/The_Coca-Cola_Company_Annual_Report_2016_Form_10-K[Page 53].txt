Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $1,165 million, or 7 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2016,
ﬂuctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 2 percent. The increase in advertising
expenses reﬂects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange
impact of 3 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reﬂects the impact of divestitures. The decrease in other
operating expenses reﬂects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer—facing advertising expenses as
well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations have a more
signiﬁcant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since
they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-
owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in US.

In 2016, the Company's total pension expense related to defined benefit plans was $238 million, which primarily included
$86 million of net periodic benefit cost and $155 million of settlement charges and special termination benefit costs. In 2017,
we expect our total pension expense to be $366 million, which includes $41 million of net periodic benefit cost and
$325 million of estimated settlement charges and special termination benefit costs expected to be incurred. The decrease in
2017 expected net periodic benefit cost is due to favorable asset performance in 2016 compared to our expected return,
partially offset by a decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the US. plans and a decrease in the
weighted-average discount rate. Refer to the heading "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position" below for
information related to these contributions. Refer to the heading "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Pension Plan
Valuations" above and Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the pension
plan assumptions used by the Company.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based
compensation arrangements granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.5 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based
compensation awards. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Year Ended December 31, 2015 versus Year Ended December 31, 2014
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $791 million, or 5 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015,
ﬂuctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent. The increase in stock-
based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2014 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-
term incentive programs as performance criteria were not achieved. The increase in advertising expenses reﬂects the
Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially oﬂset by a foreign currency exchange impact of
13 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reﬂects the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease
in other operating expenses reﬂects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising
expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations
have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution
expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our
Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated
