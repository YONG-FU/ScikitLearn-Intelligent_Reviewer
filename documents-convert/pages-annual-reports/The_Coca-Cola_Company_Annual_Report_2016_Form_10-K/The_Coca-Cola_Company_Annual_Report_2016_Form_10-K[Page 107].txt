NOTE 10: DEBT AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS
Short- Term Borrowings
Loans and notes payable consist primarily of commercial paper issued in the United States. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
we had $12,330 million and $13,035 million, respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average
interest rates for commercial paper outstanding were approximately 0.8 percent and 0.5 percent per year as of December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, we had $9,598 million in lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of
December 31, 2016. The Company's total lines of credit included $168 million that was outstanding and primarily related to our
international operations.
Included in the credit facilities discussed above, the Company had $8,170 million in lines of credit for general corporate
purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2017 through 2022. There were no borrowings under these
backup lines of credit during 2016. These credit facilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions. Some of the
Ô¨Ånancial arrangements require compensating balances, none of which is presently significant to our Company.
