As of December 31, 2016, the Company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties, including
certain variable interest entities, in the amount of $5 87 million. Fixed charges for these contingent liabilities have not been
included in the computation of the above ratios, as the amounts are immaterial and, in the opinion of management, it is not
probable that the Company will be required to satisfy the guarantees. The interest amount in the above table does not include
interest expense associated with unrecognized tax benefits.
