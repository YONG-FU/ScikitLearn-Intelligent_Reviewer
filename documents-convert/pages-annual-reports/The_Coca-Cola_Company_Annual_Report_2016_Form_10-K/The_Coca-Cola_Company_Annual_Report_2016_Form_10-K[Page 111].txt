The Company has followed the same transfer pricing methodology for these licenses since the methodology was agreed with
the IRS in a 1996 closing agreement that applied back to 1987. The closing agreement provides prospective penalty protection
as long as the Company follows the prescribed methodology and material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law
have not changed. On February 11, 2016, the IRS notified the Company, without further explanation, that the IRS has
determined that material facts and circumstances and relevant Federal tax law have changed and that it may assert penalties.
The Company does not agree with this determination. The Company's compliance with the closing agreement was audited and
confirmed by the IRS in five successive audit cycles covering the subsequent 11 years through 2006, with the last audit
concluding as recently as 2009.
The Notice represents a repudiation of the methodology previously adopted in the 1996 closing agreement. The IRS designated
the matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Therefore, the Company will be prevented from pursuing any administrative
settlement at IRS Appeals or under the IRS Advance Pricing and Mutual Agreement Program.
The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and plans to pursue all available administrative and judicial
remedies necessary to resolve this matter. To that end, the Company filed a petition in the US. Tax Court on December 14,
2015, and the IRS ﬁled its answer on February 12, 2016. A trial date has been set for March 5, 2018. The Company intends to
vigorously defend its position and is confident in its ability to prevail on the merits. The Company regularly assesses the
likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of its tax reserves. The
Company believes that the final adjudication of this matter will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash ﬂows. However, the ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain, and if the
IRS were to prevail on its assertions, the additional tax, interest and any potential penalties could have a material adverse
impact on the Company's ﬁnancial position, results of operations and cash ﬂows.
Risk Management Programs
The Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general,
we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our
self-insured retentions to reduce the Company's risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company's self-insured losses are
estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific
expectations based on our claim history. The Company's self-insurance reserves totaled $527 million and $560 million as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Workforce (Unaudited)
We refer to our employees as "associates." As of December 31, 2016, our Company had approximately 100,300 associates, of
which approximately 51,000 associates were located in the United States. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries,
is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 16,300 associates, excluding
seasonal hires, in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of
three years to five years. We currently expect that we will be able to renegotiate such agreements on satisfactory terms when
they expire. The Company believes that its relations with its associates are generally satisfactory.
