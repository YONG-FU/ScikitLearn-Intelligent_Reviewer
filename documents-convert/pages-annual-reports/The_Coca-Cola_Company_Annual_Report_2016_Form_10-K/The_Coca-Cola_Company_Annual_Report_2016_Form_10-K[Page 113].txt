Performance Share UnitAwards
Performance share units require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. The primary performance criterion used is compound annual growth
in economic profit over a predefined performance period, which is generally three years. Economic profit is our net operating
profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Beginning in 2015, the Company added net operating revenues
as an additional performance criterion. Economic profit and net operating revenues are adjusted for certain items, which are
approved and certified by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a
consistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. In the event the certified results equal the predefined
performance criteria, the Company will grant the number of shares equal to the target award. In the event the certified results
exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional shares up to the maximum award will be granted. In the event the
certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria, a reduced number of shares will be granted. If the certified
results fall below the threshold award performance level, no shares will be granted. The performance share units granted under
this program are then generally subject to a holding period of one year before the shares are released.
Performance share units generally do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends. For most performance share units
granted beginning in 2014, the Company includes a relative TSR modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end
of the performance period. For these awards, the number of shares earned based on the certified achievement of the predeﬁned
performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company's total shareowner return over the performance period relative
to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a defined range. The fair value of performance
share units that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For the remaining awards that do
not include the TSR modifier, the fair value of the performance share units is the quoted market value of the Company's stock
on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the relevant period.
In the period it becomes probable that the minimum performance criteria specified in the award will be achieved, we recognize
expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has
already lapsed for the shares expected to vest and be released. The remaining fair value of the shares expected to vest and be
released is expensed on a straight-line basis over the balance of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no
longer probable that we will achieve the minimum performance criteria specified in the award, we reverse all of the previously
recognized compensation expense in the period such a determination is made.
Performance share units are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which
case former employees or their beneficiaries are provided a cash equivalent payment. As of December 31, 2016, performance
share units of 4,830,000, 1,640,000 and 3,303,000 were outstanding for the 2014—2016, 2015—2017 and 2016—2018
performance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts in the performance share unit agreements.
