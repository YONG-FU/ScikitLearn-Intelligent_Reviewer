NOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Our Company grants awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. Total stock-based
compensation expense was $258 million, $236 million and $209 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was
included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The total
income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated statements of income related to awards under these plans was $71 million,
$65 million and $57 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Beginning in 2015, certain employees who had previously
been eligible for long-term equity awards received long-term performance cash awards. Employees who receive these
performance cash awards do not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program.
As of December 31, 2016, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based
compensation awards granted under our plans. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.5 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based
compensation awards.
The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan ("2014 Equity Plan") was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014
Equity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued, through the grant of equity
awards, to certain employees. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock
units, restricted stock and other specified award types including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria.
Beginning in 2015, the 2014 Equity Plan was the primary plan in use for equity awards and performance cash awards. There
were no grants made from the 2014 Equity Plan prior to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, there were 448.3 million shares
available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan. In addition to the 2014 Equity Plan, there were 2.7 million shares available
to be granted under stock option plans approved by shareowners in 1999 and 2008 and 0.2 million shares available to be
granted under a restricted stock award plan approved by shareowners in 1989.
Stock Option Awards
Stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per
share for the Company's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a Black-
Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and is amortized over the vesting period, generally four years. The weighted-average fair
value of stock options granted during the past three years and the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes—
Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:
2016 2015 2014
Fair value of stock options at grant date $ 4.17 $ 4.38 $ 3.91
Dividend yield1 3.2% 3.1% 2.7%
Expected volatility2 16.0% 16.0% 16.0%
Risk-free interest rate3 1.5% 1.8% 1.6%
Expected term of the stock options4 6 years 6 years 5 years
1 The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the Company's stock at the time of the grant.
2 Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company's stock, historical volatility of the Company's stock
and other factors.
3 The risk—free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the option is based on the US. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of the grant.
4 The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived by
analyzing historical exercise behavior.
Generally, stock options granted from 1999 through July 2003 expire 15 years from the date of grant, and stock options granted
in December 2003 and thereafter expire 10 years from the date of grant. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold
upon exercise of stock options are made available from either authorized and unissued Company common stock or from the
Company's treasury shares. In 2007, the Company began issuing common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from
the Company's treasury shares.
