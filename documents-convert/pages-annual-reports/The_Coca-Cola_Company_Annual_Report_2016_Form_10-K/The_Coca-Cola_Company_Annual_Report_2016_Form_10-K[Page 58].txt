Interest expense was $856 million in 2015, compared to $483 million in 2014, an increase of $373 million, or 77 percent. The
increase is primarily due to charges of $320 million the Company recorded on the early extinguishment of certain long-term
debt. Interest expense also increased as a result of an overall increase in the total debt balances and a shift in the mix of our
debt portfolio from short-term to long-term debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued
SFr1,325 million, €8,500 million and $4,000 million of long-term debt. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial

Equity Income (Loss) f Net
Year Ended December 31, 2016 versus Year Ended December 31, 2015
Equity income (loss) — net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity
method investees. In 2016, equity income was $835 million, compared to equity income of $489 million in 2015, an increase of
$346 million, or 71 percent. This increase reﬂects, among other items, more favorable operating results reported by several of
our equity method investees, the impact of the June 2015 investment in Monster, as well as our newly acquired investments in
CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary. The favorable impact of these items was partially oﬂset by the
unfavorable impact of ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a stronger US. dollar against most major
currencies and the derecognition of the Company's former equity method investment in South Africa. Refer to Note 2 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Monster Transaction and our newly acquired
investments in CCEP, CCBA and CCBA's South African subsidiary.
Year Ended December 31, 2015 versus Year Ended December 31, 2014
In 2015, equity income was $489 million, compared to equity income of $769 million in 2014, a decrease of $280 million, or
36 percent. This decrease reﬂects, among other items, the unfavorable impact of the challenging economic conditions around
the world where many of our equity method investees operate and ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to a
stronger US. dollar against most major currencies. The impact of these items was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions
of equity method investments. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Other Income (Loss) 2 Net
Other income (loss) — net includes, among other things, the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses; dividend
income, rental income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to
business combinations and disposals, realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities; realized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities; and other-than-temporary impairments of available-for-sale securities. The foreign currency
exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain
currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially oﬂset by the
impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
