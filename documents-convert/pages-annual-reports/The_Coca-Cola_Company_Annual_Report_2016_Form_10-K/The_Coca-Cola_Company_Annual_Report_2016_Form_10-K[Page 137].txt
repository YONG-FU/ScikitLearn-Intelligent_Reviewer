NOTE 19: OPERATING SEGMENTS
As of December 31, 2016, our organizational structure consisted of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and
Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Bottling Investments; and Corporate.
Segment Products and Services
The business of our Company is nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments (Europe, Middle East and Africa;
Latin America; North America; and Asia Paciﬁc) derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage
concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is
composed of our Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of the bottler, and
equity income from the majority of our equity method investments. Company-owned or consolidated bottling operations derive
the majority of their revenues from the sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net
operating revenues but lower gross profit margins compared to concentrate operations.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues related to concentrate operations and ﬁnished
product operations:

1 Includes concentrates sold by the Company to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of fountain syrups. The bottlers then
typically sell the fountain syrups to wholesalers or directly to fountain retailers.
2 Includes fountain syrups manufactured by the Company, including consolidated bottling operations, and sold to fountain retailers or to
authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who resell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers.
Method of Determining Segment Income or Loss
Management evaluates the performance of our operating segments separately to individually monitor the different factors
affecting financial performance. Our Company manages income taxes and certain treasury-related items, such as interest
income and expense, on a global basis within the Corporate operating segment. We evaluate segment performance based on
income or loss before income taxes.
