Our effective tax rate reﬂects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally
taxed at rates lower than the US. statutory rate of 35.0 percent. As a result of employment actions and capital investments
made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore
and Swaziland. The terms of these grants expire from 2017 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the
grants in these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $105 million, $223 million and
$265 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reﬂects the
benefits of having signiﬁcant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which
are generally taxed at rates lower than the US. statutory rate.
The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the US. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. US. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for all years prior to 2007. With respect
to state and local jurisdictions and countries outside the United States, with limited exceptions, the Company and its
subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2006. For US. federal and state tax purposes, the net
operating losses and tax credit carryovers acquired in connection with our acquisition of Old CCE's North America business
that were generated between the years of 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are actually
utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that
adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result
from those years.
On September 17, 2015, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the tax years 2007 through 2009, after a five-year
audit. Refer to Note 11.
As of December 31, 2016, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $302 million. If the Company were to prevail on
all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $179 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and
penalties. The remaining $123 million, which was recorded as a deferred tax asset, primarily represents tax benefits that would
be received in diﬁerent tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.
A reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014
Beginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 168 $ 211 $ 230
Increase related to prior period tax positions 163 1 4 13
Decrease related to prior period tax positions — (9) (2)
Increase related to current period tax positions 17 5 11
Decrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (40) 1 (5) (5)
Decrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations — (23) (32)
Increase (decrease) due to effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes (6) (15) (4)
Ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 302 $ 168 $ 211
1 The increase is primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Company’s tax positions as a result of receiving notification of
a preliminary settlement of a Competent Authority matter with a foreign jurisdiction, a portion of which became certain later in the year.
This change in position did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of income during the year ended
December 31, 2016, as it was partially offset by refunds to be received from the foreign jurisdiction.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The
Company had $142 million, $111 million and $113 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued
as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of these amounts, $31 million and $8 million of expense were
recognized through income tax expense in 2016 and 2014, respectively. An insignificant amount of interest and penalties were
recognized through income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain
tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would also be a benefit to the Company's effective tax rate.
It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect the
change to have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or consolidated balance sheets. These changes
may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final settlements in transfer pricing matters
that are the subject of litigation. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.
