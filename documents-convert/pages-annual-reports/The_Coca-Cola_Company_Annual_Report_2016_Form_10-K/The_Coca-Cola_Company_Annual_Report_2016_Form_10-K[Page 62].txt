Net operating revenues in the United States were $19.9 billion in 2016, or 48 percent of the Company's consolidated net
operating revenues. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, marketable securities, cash
ﬂows from operations and the issuance of debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash
commitments for investing and financing activities. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term
investments, marketable securities and cash ﬂows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating
activities and cash commitments for investing activities.
In the future, should we require more capital to fund significant discretionary activities in the United States than is generated by
our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate future periods’
earnings from foreign jurisdictions. This alternative could result in a higher effective tax rate in the future. While the likelihood
is remote, the Company could also elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered
to be indefinitely reinvested. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be
subject to additional US. income taxes (net of an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various
foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This alternative could also result in a higher eﬁective tax rate in the period in which
such a determination is made to repatriate prior period foreign earnings. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries.
Based on all the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong, and we will continue to
meet all of our financial commitments for the foreseeable future. These obligations and anticipated cash outﬂows include, but
are not limited to, regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, capital expenditures, share repurchases and obligations included
under the heading "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations" below.
Cash F lows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $8,796 million,
$10,528 million and $10,615 million, respectively.
Cash ﬂows from operating activities decreased $1,732 million, or 16 percent, in 2016 compared to 2015. This decrease
included the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the impact of $471 million in incremental contributions
made to the Company's pension plans and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The impact of these items was partially
offset by lower income tax payments. Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Net Operating Revenues" above for
additional information on the impact of foreign currency ﬂuctuations. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the tax payments.
Cash ﬂows from operating activities decreased $87 million, or 1 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. This decrease primarily
reﬂects the impact of foreign currency ﬂuctuations and an increase in tax payments, partially offset by the efficient
management of working capital. Refer to the heading "Operations Review — Net Operating Revenues" above for additional
information on the impact of foreign currency ﬂuctuations. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on the tax payments.
