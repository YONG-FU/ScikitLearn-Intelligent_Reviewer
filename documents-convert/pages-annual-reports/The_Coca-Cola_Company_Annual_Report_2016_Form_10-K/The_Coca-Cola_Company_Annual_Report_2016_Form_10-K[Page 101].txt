1 The Company records gains and losses reclassified from AOCI into income for the effective portion and ineffective portion, if any, to the
same line items in our consolidated statements of income.
2 Includes a de minimis amount of ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net gains of
$532 million from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash ﬂows occur.
Fair Value Hedging Strategy
The Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair
value of fixed-rate debt that results from ﬂuctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency
interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges
and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. The ineﬁective portions of these
hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. As of December 31, 2016, such adjustments had cumulatively decreased the
carrying value of our long-term debt by $67 million. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any
reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged
item at that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or
immediately if the hedged item has matured. The total notional values of derivatives that related to our fair value hedges of this
type were $6,158 million and $7,963 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
