The expected long-term rate of return assumption for US. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is
determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as
correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of
return assumption used in computing 2016 net periodic pension cost for the US. plans was 8.25 percent. As of December 31,
2016, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return on plan assets for the primary U.S. plan was 8.7 percent, 4.9 percent
and 6.9 percent, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 10.6 percent.
The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows:
December 31, 2016 2015 7
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 7.00% 7.00%
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 5.00% 5.00%
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2021 2021 r
The Company's U.S. postretirement benefit plans are primarily defined dollar benefit plans that limit the effects of medical
inﬂation because the plans have established dollar limits for determining our contributions. As a result, the eﬁect of a
1 percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would not be significant to the Company.
The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reﬂect the rates at which the
benefit obligations could be effectively settled. Rates for US. and certain non-U.S. plans at December 31, 2016, were
determined using a cash ﬂow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt
securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base
the discount rate on comparable indices within each of the countries. The rate of compensation increase assumption is
determined by the Company based upon annual reviews. We review external data and our own historical trends for health care
costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions.
Effective January 1, 2016, for benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company changed the method used to calculate
the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit plans and
is measuring these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected cash ﬂows. The
Company believes the new approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the
correlation between projected cash ﬂows and the corresponding spot rates. The change did not affect the measurement of the
Company's pension and other postretirement beneﬁt obligations for those plans and was accounted for as a change in
accounting estimate, which is applied prospectively.
Cash Flows
Our estimated future benefit payments for funded and unfunded plans are as follows (in millions):
iYear Ended December 31, 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022—2026 7
Pension benefit payments $ 574 $ 496 $ 521 $ 536 $ 549 $ 2,906
Other benefit payments1 65 66 67 67 67 323 7
Total estimated benefit payments $ 639 $ 562 $ 588 $ 603 $ 616 $ 3,229 r
1 The expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefit plans are net of estimated federal subsidies expected to be received
under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Federal subsidies are estimated to be $4 million for
the period 2017—2021, and $3 million for the period 2022—2026.
The Company anticipates making pension contributions in 2017 of $106 million, the majority of which will be allocated to our
international plans. The majority of these contributions are discretionary.
Defined Contribution Plans
Our Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all US. employees. Under the largest US.
defined contribution plan, we match participants' contributions up to a maximum of 3.5 percent of compensation, subject to
certain limitations. Company costs related to the US. plans were $82 million, $94 million and $92 million in 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. Company costs
associated with those plans were $37 million, $35 million and $36 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
