and added water,

drinks and carbonated waters and ﬂavored waters;
° "still beverages" means nonalcoholic beverages without carbonation, including noncarbonated waters, ﬂavored waters

- "Company Trademark Beverages" means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverage products bearing
trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive
economic benefit; and
- "Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages" or "Trademark Coca-Cola" means beverages bearing the trademark Coca-Cola or
any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Life, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and
Coca-Cola Zero and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, etc.).
Likewise, when we use the capitalized word "Trademark" together with the name of one of our other beverage products
(such as "Trademark Fanta," "Trademark Sprite" or "Trademark Simply"), we mean beverages bearing the indicated
trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions (such that "Trademark
Fanta" includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Apple, etc.; "Trademark Sprite" includes Sprite, Diet Sprite,
Sprite Zero, Sprite Light, etc.; and "Trademark Simply" includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit,

Our Company markets, manufactures and sells:
° beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as "beverage bases," and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this
part of our business as our "concentrate business" or "concentrate operations"), and
- finished sparkling and still beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our "finished product business" or "ﬁnished
product operations").
Generally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate
operations.
In our concentrate operations, we typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to authorized
bottling and canning operations (to which we typically refer as our "bottlers" or our "bottling partners"). Our bottling partners
either combine the concentrates with sweeteners (depending on the product), still water and/or sparkling water, or combine the
syrups with sparkling water to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers —
such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles — bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to
us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. Outside the United States, we
also sell concentrates for fountain beverages to our bottling partners who are typically authorized to manufacture fountain
syrups, which they sell to fountain retailers such as restaurants and convenience stores which use the fountain syrups to
produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the
fountain syrups to fountain retailers.
