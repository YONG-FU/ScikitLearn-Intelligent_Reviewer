If valued at the December 31, 2016 quoted closing prices of shares actively traded on stock markets, the value of our equity
method investments in publicly traded bottlers would have exceeded our carrying value by $6,179 million. However, the
carrying value of our investment in CCEP exceeded the fair value of the investment as of December 31, 2016 by $462 million.
Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition
and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature.
Therefore, we did not record an impairment charge.
