As of December 31, 2016, indefinitely reinvested earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries amounted to $35.5 billion.
Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no US. federal and state income taxes have been
provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to
both US. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign
countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred US. income tax liability is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation; however, unrecognized foreign tax credits would be available to
reduce a portion of the US. tax liability.
The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the
