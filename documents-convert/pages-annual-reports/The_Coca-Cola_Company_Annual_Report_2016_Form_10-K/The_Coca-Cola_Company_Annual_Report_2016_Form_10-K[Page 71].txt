1 Includes a decrease in net assets of $626 million resulting from foreign currency translation adjustments in various balance sheet accounts.
The increases (decreases) in the table above include the impact of the following transactions and events:
- Assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale decreased primarily due to the deconsolidation of the Company's German
and South African bottling operations which were previously classified as held for sale, partially offset by the Company's
China bottling operations and additional North America bottling territories being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
- Equity method investments increased primarily as a result of the Company's new investments in CCEP, CCBA and
CCBA's South African subsidiary, partially offset by the derecognition of the Company's former equity method
investment in South Africa. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
° Other investments decreased primarily due to the disposal of the Company's investment in Keurig, which was accounted
for as an available-for-sale security. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.
- Property, plant and equipment and bottlers' franchise rights decreased primarily as a result of additional North America
bottling territories being refranchised or reclassified as held for sale as well as the Company's China bottling operations
being reclassified as held for sale. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
- Long-term debt increased due to the Company's recent issuances of Australian dollar-, euro- and US. dollar-
denominated debt, partially offset by a portion of the Company's long-term debt maturing within the next 12 months and
being reclassified as current. Refer to the heading "Cash Flows from Financing Activities" above for additional
information.
- Deferred income taxes decreased primarily due to the impact of refranchising certain bottling operations. Refer to Note 2
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
