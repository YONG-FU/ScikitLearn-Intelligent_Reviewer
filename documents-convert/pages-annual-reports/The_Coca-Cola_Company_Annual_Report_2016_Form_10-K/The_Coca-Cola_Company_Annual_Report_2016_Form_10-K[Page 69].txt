Foreign Exchange
Our international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency ﬂuctuations and governmental
actions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to
changing economic and political environments, and to ﬂuctuations in foreign currencies.
In 2016, we used 73 functional currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some of these
currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign
currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies,
strengthened (weakened) against the US. dollar as follows:
Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014
All operating currencies (5)% (15)% (5)%
Brazilian real (9)% (27)% (10)%’
Mexican peso (14) (16) (4)
Australian dollar (1) (17) (7)
South African rand (13) (15) (12)
British pound (11) (8) 6
Euro — (17) 1
Japanese yen 11 (14) (8)
These percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reﬂect the actual impact of
ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed
to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share.
The total currency impacts on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, were decreases of 3 percent
and 7 percent in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total currency impacts on income before income taxes, including the eﬁect of
our hedging activities, were decreases of 12 percent in 2016 and 6 percent in 2015.
Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities
from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially
offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to
Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are included as a
component of other income (loss) — net in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Refer to the heading "Operations Review —
Other Income (Loss) — Net" above. The Company recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $246 million in 2016, foreign
currency exchange gains of $ 149 million in 2015 and foreign currency exchange losses of $569 million in 2014.
Hyperinﬂationary Economies
A hyperinﬂationary economy is one that has cumulative inﬂation of 100 percent or more over a three-year period. In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, local subsidiaries in hyperinﬂationary
economies are required to use the US. dollar as their functional currency and remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities not
denominated in US. dollars using the rate applicable to conversion of a currency for purposes of dividend remittances. All
exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized currently in income.
Venezuela has been designated as a hyperinﬂationary economy. Beginning in the first quarter of 20 14, the Venezuelan
government recognized three legal exchange rates to convert bolivars to the US. dollar: (1) the oﬁicial rate of 6.3 bolivars per
US. dollar; (2) SICAD 1, which was available to foreign investments and designated industry sectors to exchange a limited
volume of bolivars for US. dollars using a bid rate established at weekly auctions; and (3) SICAD 2, which applied to
transactions that did not qualify for either the official rate or SICAD 1. As of March 28, 2014, the three legal exchange rates
were 6.3 (official rate), 10.8 (SICAD 1) and 50.9 (SICAD 2). We determined that the SICAD 1 rate was the most appropriate
rate to use for remeasurement given our circumstances and estimates of the applicable rate at which future transactions could be
settled, including the payment of dividends. Therefore, as of March 28, 2014, we remeasured the net monetary assets of our
Venezuelan subsidiary using an exchange rate of 10.8 bolivars per US. dollar, resulting in a charge of $226 million recorded in
the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income.
