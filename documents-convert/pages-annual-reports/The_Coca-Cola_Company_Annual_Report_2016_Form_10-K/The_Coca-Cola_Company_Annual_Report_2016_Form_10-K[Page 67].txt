1 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding short—term loans and notes payable. Upon
payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are
expected to ﬂuctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.
2 Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding long—term debt. We will consider several
alternatives to settle this long—term debt, including the use of cash ﬂows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or
issuance of other long—term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be paid by the Company in future periods and excludes
the noncash portion of debt, including the fair market value mark up, unamortized discounts and premiums.
3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long—term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate
debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2016 rate for all years presented. We typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash
ﬂows from operating activities and/or short—term borrowings.
4 Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. As of December 31, 2016, the
noncurrent portion of our income tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, was
$439 million, which was not included in the total above. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of our income tax
liability cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits would be partially offset by reductions in
payments in other jurisdictions.
5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all
significant terms, including long—term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We
expect to fund these obligations with cash ﬂows from operating activities.
6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash ﬂows from operating activities.
7 Represents liabilities of the Company's North America bottling territories and China bottling operations that are classified as held for sale.
The total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2016, was
$2,336 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other
items, pension expense, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment
return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount
in the contractual obligations table.
We generally expect to fund all future pension contributions with cash ﬂows from operating activities. Our international
pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations.
