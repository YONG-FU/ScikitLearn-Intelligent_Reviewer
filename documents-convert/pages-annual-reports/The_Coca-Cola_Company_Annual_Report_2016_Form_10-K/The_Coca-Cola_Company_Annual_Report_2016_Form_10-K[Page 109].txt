The carrying value of the Company's long-term debt included fair value adjustments related to the debt assumed from
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.'s ("Old CCE") former North America business in 2010 of $361 million and $411 million as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These fair value adjustments are being amortized over the number of years
remaining until the underlying debt matures. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted-average maturity of the assumed debt to
which these fair value adjustments relate was approximately 21 years. The amortization of these fair value adjustments will be
a reduction of interest expense in future periods, which will typically result in our interest expense being less than the actual
interest paid to service the debt.
Total interest paid was $663 million, $515 million and $498 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
