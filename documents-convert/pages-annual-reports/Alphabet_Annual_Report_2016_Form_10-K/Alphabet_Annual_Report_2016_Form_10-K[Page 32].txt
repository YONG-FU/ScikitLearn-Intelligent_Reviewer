Consolidated Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of trafﬁc acquisition costs ('lAC) which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for
ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access
points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment
manufacturers, and software developers.
Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding trafﬁc acquisition costs) includes
the following:
- The expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy,
bandwidth, and other equipment costs);
- Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license
their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content
providers based on revenues generated or a ﬂat fee);
- Credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;
- Stock-based compensation expense;
- Inventory related costs for hardware we sell; and
- Amortization of certain intangible assets.

The cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on the properties of our Google
Network Members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads
placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network Members’
properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.
Cost of revenues increased $6,974 million from 2015 to 2016 due to various factors including traffic acquisition
costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, and hardware costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs of
$2,450 million was due to increases in advertising revenues primarily from the growth of mobile search and
programmatic ad buying which carry higher TAC. The increase in other cost of revenues of $4,524 million was primarily
due to increases in (1) data centers costs including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth, and other equipment costs
as a result of business growth, (2) content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube, (3)
hardware costs associated with new hardware launches, and (4) stock-based compensation.
