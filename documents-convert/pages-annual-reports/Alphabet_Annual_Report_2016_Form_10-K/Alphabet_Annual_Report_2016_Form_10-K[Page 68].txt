Note 6. Acquisitions
2016 Acquisitions
Apigee
In October 2016, we completed the acquisition of Apigee Corp., a provider of application programming interface
(API) management, for approximately $571 million in cash. We expect the acquisition to accelerate our Google Cloud
customers’ move to supporting their businesses with high quality digital interactions. Ofthe total purchase price of $571
million, $41 million was cash acquired, $127 million was attributed to intangible assets, $376 million was attributed to
goodwill, and $27 million was attributed to net assets acquired. Goodwill, which was recorded in the Google segment, is
primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is not deductible for tax purposes.
OtherAcquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets
for total consideration of approximately $448 million. In aggregate, $12 million was cash acquired, $143 million was
attributed to intangible assets, $288 million was attributed to goodwill, and $5 million was attributed to net assets
acquired. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our
expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes
is approximately $67 million.
Proforma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to
the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.
For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2016, patents and
developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years, customer relationships have a weighted-
average useful life of 3.4 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.2 years.
2015 Acquisitions
bebop Technologies
In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of bebop Technologies Inc. (bebop), a company with a cloud-
based development platform focused on enterprise applications. The fair value of total consideration transferred in
connection with the close was $272 million, of which $1 million was paid in cash and $271 million was paid in the form
of Alphabet Class C capital stock. We issued a total of approximately 514 thousand shares ofAlphabet Class C capital
stock in relation to this acquisition, part of which will be accounted for as compensation expense. The fair value of the
shares of capital stock issued was determined based on the closing market price of Alphabet's Class C capital stock
as of the close date. The Class C capital stock issued by Alphabet in connection with the acquisition was treated as
a capital contribution from Alphabet to Google. We expect the acquisition will help us provide a new platform to build
and maintain enterprise applications. As part of the acquisition, Diane Greene, the former CEO of bebop and a member
of our Board of Directors, has joined Google.
