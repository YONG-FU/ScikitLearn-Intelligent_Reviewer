NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August
2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.
On August 10, 2015, we announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet), and
a new operating structure. On October 2, 2015, we implemented the holding company reorganization, and as a result,
Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google Inc. (Google).
The implementation of the holding company reorganization on October 2, 2015 was accounted for as a merger
under common control. Alphabet has recognized the assets and liabilities of Google at carryover basis. The consolidated
ﬁnancial statements of Alphabet present comparative information for prior years on a combined basis, as if both
Alphabet and Google were under common control for all periods presented.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and all wholly owned
subsidiaries as well as all variable interest entities where we are the primary beneﬁciary. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in
the ﬁnancial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances,
fair values of ﬁnancial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and
equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

We generate revenues primarily by delivering performance and brand advertising. Performance advertising
creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Brand advertising
enhances users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and
other ads that run across various devices.
Google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on Google.com, the Google app,
YouTube, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Maps and Google Play. Google Network
