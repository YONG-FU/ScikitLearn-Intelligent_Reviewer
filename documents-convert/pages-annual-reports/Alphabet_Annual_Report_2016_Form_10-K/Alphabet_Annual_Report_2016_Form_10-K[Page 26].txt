We continue to make signiﬁcant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus for
Google, such as search, advertising, and machine learning, as well as in new products and services across both
Google and Other Bets. The amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the
long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology
infrastructure.

to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of

Information about Segments
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our
other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating
segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.
Our reported segments are described below:
- Google — Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube,
Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, and Google Play as well as our hardware initiatives. Our technical
infrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues
primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud offerings, and sales of hardware products.
- Other Bets — Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material.
Other Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues
from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Google Fiber,
sales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily.
