Note 16. Subsequent Event
In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase
a non-controlling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. We closed the first tranche of the investment
in February 2017 and anticipate closing the second and ﬁnal tranche upon completion of certain terms in the second
half of 2017. The transaction will be accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized.
