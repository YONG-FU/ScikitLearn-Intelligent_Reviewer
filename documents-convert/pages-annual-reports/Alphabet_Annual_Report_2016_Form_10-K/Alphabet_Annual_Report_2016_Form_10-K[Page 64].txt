including impairment was a net loss of $48 million, $227 million, and $202 million for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, investments accounted for under the cost
method had a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $7.5 billion
and $8.1 billion, respectively. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data
leveraging private-market transactions and are classiﬁed within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We reﬂect our share
of equity method investee earnings and losses and impairments of non-marketable equity investments as a component
of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
Certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under
the equity method are variable interest entities ("VIE"). These entities' activities involve power generation using
renewable sources. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the
activities that would signiﬁcantly impact VIE's economic performance such as setting operating budgets. Therefore,
we do not consolidate these VIEs in our financial statements. The carrying value of these VIEs was $1.3 billion with
a maximum exposure of $1 .3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $1.2 billion with a maximum exposure of $1 .2 billion
as of December 31, 2016. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date. We have determined the
single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investment in these entities. We periodically reassess whether
we are the primary beneﬁciary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power
to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances.
We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, and vice versa, based
on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure.
Non-Marketable Debt Securities
Our non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible
notes issued by private companies. The cost of these securities was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31,
2015 and 2016, respectively. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized
accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination
of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated
timing, probability, and amount of cash ﬂows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies
may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the
measurement date. No signiﬁcant impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and
2016.

Short-Term Debt
Google had a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper
and a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015. In February 2016, we replaced this program with
a new short-term debt ﬁnancing program of up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper and a $4.0 billion revolving credit
facility, which expires in February 2021. Net proceeds from these programs are used for general corporate purposes.
We had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with aweighted-average interest
rate of 0.2% as of December 31 , 2015 and no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31 , 2016. The estimated
fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2015.
The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. No amounts
were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.
