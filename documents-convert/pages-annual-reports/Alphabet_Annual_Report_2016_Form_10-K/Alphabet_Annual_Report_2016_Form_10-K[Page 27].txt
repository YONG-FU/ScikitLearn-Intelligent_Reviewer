Use of Monetization Metrics
When assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the percentage change
in the number of "paid clicks" and "cost-per—click" for our Google properties and Google Network Members' properties.
Management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. We periodically review, reﬁne and
update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the
revenues generated by click activity.
Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by
end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties
including Gmail, Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted as an
engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad) and certain trial ad formats. Paid clicks for our Google Network
Members' properties include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members'
properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content and AdMob businesses. In some cases, such
as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this
represents a small part of our revenue base.
Cost-per-click is deﬁned as click—driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the
average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
Revenue growth and the change in revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on
Google properties and Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, has ﬂuctuated
and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:
- growth rates of our revenues from Google properties, including YouTube, compared to those of our revenues
from Google Network Members' properties;
- advertiser competition for keywords;
- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
- seasonality;
