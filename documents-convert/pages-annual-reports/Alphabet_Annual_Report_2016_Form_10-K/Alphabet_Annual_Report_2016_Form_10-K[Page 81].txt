Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Signiﬁcant components
of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):

As of December 31, 2016, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $592 million and $681 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to
expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017. It is more likely than not that
our state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance
against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the
differentjurisdictions. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $304 million that will
begin to expire in 2022.
As of December 31 , 2016, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes
were approximately $1,515 million that can be carried over indeﬁnitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to
be realized. Our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $166 million that will
start to expire in 2025. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the foreign tax credit will be realized.
As of December 31 , 2016, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets
relating primarily to investment losses that are capital in nature, California deferred tax assets, and certain foreign net
operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We established a deferred tax asset for the book-to-tax
basis difference in our investments in Arris shares received from the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris in
2013. Since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale ofArris shares will be capital losses, a valuation allowance
has been recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not likely to be covered by
capital gains generated as of 2016. We reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a
partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax beneﬁt will be recorded accordingly.
As a result of the Altera opinion, we have recognized a deferred tax asset of $4.4 billion and a deferred tax liability
of $4.4 billion. Refer to above for more details on the Altera case.
