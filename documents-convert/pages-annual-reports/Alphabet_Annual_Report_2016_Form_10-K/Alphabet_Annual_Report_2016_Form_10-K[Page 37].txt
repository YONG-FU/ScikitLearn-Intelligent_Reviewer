Capital Resources and Liquidity
As of December 31, 2016, we had $86.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid
debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt
instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and
asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions
or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.
As of December 31, 2016, $52.2 billion of the $86.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities
was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required
to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds
outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash
ﬂow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt ﬁnancing program of up to $5.0 billion through
the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had
no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016. In conjunction with this program, we have a $4.0 billion
revolving credit facility expiring in February 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a
formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility.
We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including
capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at
least the next 12 months.
As of December 31, 2016, we have unsecured senior notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total
carrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.9 billion.
In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. In September
2016, we exercised our option to purchase the property for approximately $220 million.
In October 201 5, the board of directors ofAlphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59
of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. In January 2016, the board of directors of
Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. We
completed all authorized share repurchases under this repurchase program.
In October 201 6, the board ofdirectors ofAlphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $7,019,340,976.83
of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are expected to be executed from time to time, subject to general business
and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated
transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. No shares were repurchased in 2016 under this program.
In January 2017, Temasek, a Singapore-based investment company, signed a binding commitment to purchase
a non-controlling interest in Verily for an aggregate of $800 million in cash. We closed the first tranche of the investment
in February 2017 and anticipate closing the second and ﬁnal tranche upon completion of certain terms in the second
half of 2017.
