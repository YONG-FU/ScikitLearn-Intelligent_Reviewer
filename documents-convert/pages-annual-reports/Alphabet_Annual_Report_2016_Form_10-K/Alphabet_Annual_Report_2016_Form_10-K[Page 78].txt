cost share payments if the tax court's opinion is sustained. Refer to Note 14 for more detail regarding the Altera case.

expected to be ultimately settled in cash. Awards which we expect to be ultimately settled in cash are classified as
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Beginning January 1, 2016, we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures.
