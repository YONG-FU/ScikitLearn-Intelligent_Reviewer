months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion
as of December 31, 2015 and 2016.
We have used interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain ﬁxed
rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $295 million and $0 million as of December 31, 2015 and
2016.
Gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in other income (expense),
net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we
use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than
the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in
other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The
notional principal of these foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $7.5 billion and $7.9 billion as of December
31,2015 and 2016.
We also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) fonNard purchase
commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA
contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at
the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are
not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related
costs, in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and
losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities
are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into other income
(expense), net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $50 million and $0 million as of
December 31, 2015 and 2016.
