Foreign Currency
Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the ﬁnancial
statements of these subsidiaries to US. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average
rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record
translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We
reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to
functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in other income (expense), net.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended
December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $3,004 million,
$3,186 million, and $3,868 million, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In May 2014, the FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09
(Topic 606) "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
in Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition”, and requires entities to recognize revenue
when they transfer control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We intend to early adopt Topic 606
as of January 1, 2017, using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts which were not
completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we will recognize the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance as an
adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings. Prior periods will not be retrospectively adjusted. We expect
the adoption of Topic 606 will not have a material impact to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, including the
presentation of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) "Financial
Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."
ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for ﬁnancial
instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15, 2017. The most significant impact relates to the recognition and measurement of equity investments
at fair value in the consolidated statement of income. While we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard, we
anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will increase the volatility of our other income (expense), net, resulting
from the remeasurement of our equity investments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) "Leases". Topic 842
supersedes the lease recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation Topic 840, "Leases". Under Topic
842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced
disclosures. Leases will continue to be classified as either finance or operating. Topic 842 is effective for annual
reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities are required to
use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest
comparative period in the financial statements, and there are certain optional practical expedients that an entity may
elect to apply. Full retrospective application is prohibited and early adoption by public entities is permitted. We anticipate
that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will materially affect our statement of ﬁnancial position and will require changes to
our systems and processes. We have not yet made any decision on the timing of adoption or method of adoption with
respect to the optional practical expedients.
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial Instruments-
Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" which requires the measurement
and recognition of expected credit losses forfinancial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing
incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of
credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning
after December 15, 2019. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on
our consolidated financial statements.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) "Development Stage
Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable
Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation." ASU 2014-10 removes the deﬁnition of a development stage
