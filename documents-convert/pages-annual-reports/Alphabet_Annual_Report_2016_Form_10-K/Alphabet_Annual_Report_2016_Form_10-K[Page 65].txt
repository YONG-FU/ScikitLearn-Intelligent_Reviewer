In August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. In September
2016, we exercised our option to purchase the property for approximately $220 million.
Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the "2011 Notes") in May
2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as well as $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the "2014 Notes") in February
2014 due 2024.
In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014
Notes due 2024 (collectively, the "Google Notes"). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the
Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity.
Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the
change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.
In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the "2016 Notes") due 2026. The net
proceeds from the issuance of the 2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of
outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are
structurally subordinated to the outstanding Google Notes.

The effective interest yields based on proceeds received from the outstanding notes due in 2021, 2024 and 2026
were 3.734%, 3.377% and 2.231% respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. We may redeem these notes at
any time in whole or in part at speciﬁed redemption prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was
approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. The fair value was
determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized
accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
