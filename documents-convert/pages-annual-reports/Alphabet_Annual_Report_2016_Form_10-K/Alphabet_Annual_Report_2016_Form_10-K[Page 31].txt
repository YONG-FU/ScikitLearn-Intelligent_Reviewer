Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant
period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange
rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-
year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period
exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.
Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in
current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated
using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with
GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

In 2016 and in 2015, our revenues from the United Kingdom were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign
currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the British pound weakened relative to the US. dollar.
In 2016, our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the US. dollar strengthened relative to certain
currencies including the Euro and Argentine peso, partially offset by the impact of the US. dollar weakening relative
to the Japanese yen.
In 2015, our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by
changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the US. dollar strengthened relative to the Euro,
Brazilian real, Australian dollar, and Japanese yen.
