operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent
payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.

Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates
of future payments to be made under these leases.
We have entered into certain non-cancelable lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between
2021 and 2035 where we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Excluded from
the table above are future minimum lease payments under such leases totaling approximately $1.4 billion, for which
a $940 million liability is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.
Rent expense under operating leases was $570 million, $734 million, and $897 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016,
respectively.
Purchase Obligations
As of December 31, 2016, we had $2.5 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related
to data center operations and facility build-outs, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as
well as certain inventory purchase commitments.
Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2016, we had unused letters of credit for $797 million.
lndemnifications
In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain
parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed
to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual
property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within
which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into
indemnification agreements with our ofﬁcers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations
to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemniﬁcation
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have
a limited history of prior indemniﬁcation claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not
had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that
valid indemniﬁcation claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations or cash ﬂows in a particular period.
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible. As part of the sale of Motorola Mobile, we issued indemnifications for certain potential liabilities. Please see
Note 9 for additional information.
