Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in cash received
from advertising revenues and Google other revenues, offset by increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and
operating expenses. Additionally, the timing of tax payments and refunds had a favorable impact to our cash ﬂows
from operations for 2016 compared to 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to increased net income
adjusted for depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, and loss on sales of marketable and non-marketable
securities. This was partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment,
purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase
agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions
and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.
Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to increases in purchases of
marketable securities, increases in cash collateral paid related to securities lending and increases in spend related to
acquisitions partially offset by increases in maturities and sales of marketable securities and decreases in purchases
of non-marketable investments.
Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to net increases in purchases of
marketable securities, activities related to securities lending and purchases of non-marketable investments. This
increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions, lower investments in reverse repurchase
agreements, and a decrease in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate
purchases.

debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments from stock-based award activities.
Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily driven by decreases in proceeds from
issuance of debt, and increases in the repurchases of capital stock and net payments related to stock-based award
activities, partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments.
