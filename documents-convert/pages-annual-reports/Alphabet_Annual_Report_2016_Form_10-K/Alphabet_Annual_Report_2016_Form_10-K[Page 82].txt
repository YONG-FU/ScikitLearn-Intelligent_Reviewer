The total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $3,294 million, $4,167 million, and $5,393 million as of
December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively, of which, $2,909 million, $3,614 million, and $4,258 million if
recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.
As of December 31, 2015 and 2016, we had accrued $348 million and $493 million in interest and penalties in
provision for income taxes.
We ﬁle income tax returns in the US. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two
major tax jurisdictions are the US. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income
tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS completed its examination through our 2006 tax years; all
issues have been concluded except for one which is currently under review in Tax Court. The IRS is currently examining
our 2007 through 2012 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting
transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.
Our 2013, 2014, 2015, and 201 6 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for US. federal tax purposes,
and our 2011 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for
Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our ﬁnancial
statements.
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax
authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are
resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for
income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, closure of audits is
not certain, it is reasonably possible that certain US. federal and non-U.S. tax audits may be concluded within the
next 12 months, which could signiﬁcantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts.
We estimate that our unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 could possibly decrease by
approximately $200 million to $700 million in the next 12 months. Positions that may be resolved include various US.
and non-U.S. matters.
