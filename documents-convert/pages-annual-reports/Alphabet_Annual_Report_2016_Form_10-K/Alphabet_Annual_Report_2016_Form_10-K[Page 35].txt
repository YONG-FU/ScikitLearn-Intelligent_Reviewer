related expenses of $121 million and an increase of $80 million of miscellaneous general and administrative expenses.
These factors were partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees and expenses of $128 million, primarily
due to lower legal-related costs.
We expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage
of revenues in 2017 and future periods.
Stock-Based Compensation
The following table presents stock-based compensation expense for awards we expect to settle in equity (in
millions) for the periods presented:
7 Year Ended December 31, 7
2014 2015 2016
[Stock-based compensation $ 4,175 $ 5,203 $ 6,703 i
Stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues 6.3% 6.9% 7.4%
Stock-based compensation related to awards we expected to settle in equity increased $1,500 million from 2015
to 2016 and $1,028 million from 2014 to 2015. These increases were primarily driven by headcount growth.
We estimate stock-based compensation expense related to awards we expect to settle in equity to be
approximately $6.3 billion in 2017 and $8.3 billion thereafter related to stock-based awards outstanding as of December
31, 2016. These estimates do not include expense related to stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2016.
Consolidated Other Income (Expense), Net
The following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions) for the periods presented:
7 Year Ended December 31, 7
’ 2014 _ 2015 _ 2016 ’
[Other income (expense), net $ 763 $ 291 $ 434 l
Other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues 1.1% 0.4% 0.5%
Other income (expense), net, increased $143 million from 2015 to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by
an increase in interest income and decreased losses on non-marketable investments, partially offset by increased
losses from our foreign currency transactions and impairments for certain assets.
Other income (expense), net, decreased $472 million from 2014 to 2015. This decrease was primarily related to
awritedown of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business as well as reduced gains on non-marketable
investments as compared to 2014. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result
of increased cash and ﬁxed income investments.
The costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income (expense), net, are primarily a
function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of foreign
exchange rates relative to the contract prices, the volatility of foreign exchange rates and forward points. As we began
using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our forecasted revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect
the hedging costs expensed in other income (expense), net, will decrease in 2017 and future periods as a result of
less option premiums paid.
Consolidated Provision for Income Taxes
The following table presents our provision for income taxes (in millions) and effective tax rate for the periods
presented:
Year Ended December 31,
: 2014 2015 2016 :
[Provision for income taxes 3 3,639 $ 3,303 $ 4,672 l
Effective tax rate 21.1% 16.8% 19.3%
Our provision forincometaxes and our effective tax rate increased from 201 5 to 2016, largely dueto proportionately
more earnings generated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates and discrete items in 2015 and 2016,
partially offset by the stock-based compensation beneﬁts recognized resulting from the adoption of Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09).
