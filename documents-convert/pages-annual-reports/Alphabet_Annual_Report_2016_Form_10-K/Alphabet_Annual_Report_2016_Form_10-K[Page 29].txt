in the cost-per—click paid by our advertisers. The decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube
engagement ads where cost-per—click remains lower than on our other advertising platforms, as well as changes in
property and device mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening
of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

- AdMob; and

Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $565 million from 2015 to 2016. The growth was
primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying as well as strength in AdMob, offset by a decline in
our traditional AdSense business and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign
currencies.
The increase in paid clicks from 2015 to 2016 resulted from the growth in AdMob offset by declines in AdSense.
The decrease in cost-per—click paid by our advertisers from 2015 to 2016 resulted from changes in the product mix of
Google Network Members advertising revenues, ongoing product and policy changes, changes in property and device
mix, geographic mix, and relative ﬂuctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $494 million from 2014 to 2015. The increase
was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our continued AdSense advertising
policy changes aimed at enriching the experience for users and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared
to certain foreign currencies. The decrease in Google Network Members' properties revenues as a percentage of
Google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of Google Network Members' properties revenues
compared to that of Google properties revenues as well as Google other revenues.
The decreases in both paid clicks and cost-per—click paid by our advertisers from 2014 to 2015 were primarily
driven by ongoing product and policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search,
changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar
compared to certain foreign currencies.
