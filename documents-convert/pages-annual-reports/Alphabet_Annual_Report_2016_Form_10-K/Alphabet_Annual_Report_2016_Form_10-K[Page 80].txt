The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:
7 Year Ended December 31, 7
: 2014 2015 2016
[US federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 %}
Foreign rate differential (12.2)% (13.4)% (11.0)%
[Federal research credit (1 .8)% (2.1)% (2.0)%}
Stock-based compensation expense 0.1 % 0.3 % (3.4)%
[Other adjustments 0.0 % (3.0)% 0.7 %}
Effective tax rate 21.1 % 16.8 % 19.3 %
We adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2016, which requires the excess tax benefits or deﬁciencies to be
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes whereas they
previously were recognized in equity. Total excess tax beneﬁts recognized in 2016 was $1.0 billion.
Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than
the federal statutory tax rate. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary.
As of December 31, 2016, we have not recognized deferred US. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on
a cumulative total of $60.7 billion of undistributed earnings and other basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries. We
intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the US. If such earnings
and other basis differences in our investment foreign subsidiaries were to be repatriated in the future, they would be
subject to US. income taxes and applicable non-U.S. income and withholding taxes. Determining the unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to such investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable.
On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the
portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing
arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. The US. Tax Court issued the ﬁnal decision on December
28, 2015. The IRS served a Notice of Appeal on February 22, 2016. At this time, the US. Treasury has not withdrawn
the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have evaluated the opinion and continue
to record a tax beneﬁt in 2016 related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based
compensation costs. In addition, we continue to record a tax liability for the US. tax cost of potential repatriation of
the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that the Company
has the ability and the intent to indeﬁnitely reinvest these contingent earnings. The net impact to our consolidated
ﬁnancial statements is not material. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential
impact on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
