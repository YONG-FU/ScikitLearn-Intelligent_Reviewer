Our Google other revenues increased $2,926 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of Google

oﬁenngs.
Our Google other revenues increased $1,104 million from 2014 to 2015 and increased as a percentage of Google
segment revenues. These increases were primarily due to the growth of our sales of digital content products in the
Google Play store, primarily apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to partners). In addition, there was an
increase in revenues from service fees received for Google Cloud offerings. These increases were partially offset by
the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

Our Other Bets revenues increased $364 million from 2015 to 2016 and increased as a percentage of consolidated
revenues. These increases were primarily driven by sales of Nest branded hardware and revenues from Fiber internet
and TV services. There was also an increase in revenues from Verily licensing and R&D services from 2015 to 2016.
Our Other Bets revenues increased $118 million from 2014 to 2015 and remained relatively ﬂat as a percentage
of consolidated revenues. The increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from sales of Nest branded hardware
and revenues from internet and TV services, partially offset by a decrease in licensing revenues. As Nest was acquired
in February 2014, the increase in our Nest revenues is impacted by a partial year of revenues in 2014 as compared
to a full year in 2015.
Due to the early stage of our Other Bets businesses and because their revenues aggregates a number of
businesses operating in different industries, our Other Bets revenues may ﬂuctuate in future periods. Additionally, our
Other Bets revenues may ﬂuctuate due to one-time items.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth
The impact of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period
comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign
currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the US dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We use non-
GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for ﬁnancial and operational decision-making
and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency
basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the
effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.
