During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment charge in other cost of revenues of $378
million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition, which we retained
subsequent to the sale of Motorola Mobile. The asset was determined to be impaired due to prolonged decreased
royalty payments and unpaid interest owed and was written down to its fair value. Fair value was determined based
on a discounted cash flow method and reﬂects estimated future cash flows associated with the patent licensing royalty
asset at the measurement date and falls within level 3 in fair value hierarchy. Impairments of intangible assets were
not material for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.
