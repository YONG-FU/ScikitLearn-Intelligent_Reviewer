Consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in the average
number of paid streaming memberships globally, the majority of which was growth in our international memberships reﬂecting our expansion and focus on Netﬂix
as a global internet TV network. The impact from membership growth was coupled with an increase in global streaming average monthly revenue per paying
membership resulting from price changes and plan mix partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency ﬂuctuations impacting our International streaming
segment. The increase in operating income and net income is due primarily to increased revenues partially offset by increased content expenses as we continue to
acquire, license and produce content, including more Netﬂix originals, as well as increased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion.
Net income was further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuances as well as to an increase in our effective tax rate, slightly
offset by gains on foreign currency denominated transactions. We intend to focus on growing our global operating margin in 2017.
We offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the US. our "basic" plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard deﬁnition
quality streaming on a single screen at a time. Our "standard" plan is our most popular streaming plan and is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high
definition quality streaming on two screens concurrently. Our "premium" plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high deﬁnition and ultra-high
definition quality content on four screens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the US. and range in price from the US.
dollar equivalent of approximately $5.00 to $18.00 per month.
We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the
price of our standard plan from $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S.,
we increased the price of this same standard plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In
2016, we phased out grandfathered pricing, giving members the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 per month, continuing on the standard
streaming plan at the higher price of $9.99 per month, or electing the premium plan at $11.99 per month.
The following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:
- We deﬁne contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment. We believe this is an important
measure of our operating segment performance as it represents each segment's performance before global corporate costs.
- For the Domestic and International streaming segments, content expenses, which include the amortization of the streaming content assets and other
expenses associated with the licensing and acquisition of streaming content, represent the vast majority of cost of revenues. Streaming content rights were
generally obtained for our current geographic regions. As we expanded internationally, we obtained additional rights for the new geographies. With our
global expansion, we now aSpire to obtain global rights for our content. We allocate this content between the Domestic and International segments based
on estimated fair market value. Other cost of revenues such as streaming delivery expenses, customer service and payment processing fees, including
those we pay to our integrated payment partners, tend to be lower as a percentage of total cost of revenues . We have built our own global content
delivery network ("Open Connect") to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Streaming
