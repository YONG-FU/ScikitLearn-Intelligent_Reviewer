Stock-Based Compensation
Stock options granted are exercisable for the full ten year contractual term regardless of employment status. The following table summarizes the assumptions
used to value option grants using the lattice-binomial model and the valuation data:
Year Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Dividend yield —% —% —%1
Expected volatility 40% - 50% 36% - 53% 41% - 48%
’Risk-free interest rate 1.57% - 2.04% 2.03% - 2.29% 2.39% - 2.83% ‘
SubOptimal exercise factor 2.48 2.47 - 2.48 2.66 - 5.44
’Valuation data: ‘
Weighted-average fair value (per share) $ 48.85 $ 39.22 $ 30.17
'Total stock-based compensation expense (in thousands) 173,675 124,725 115,239 ‘
Total income tax impact on provision (in thousands) 65,173 47,125 43,999
The Company considers several factors in determining the suboptimal exercise factor, including the historical and estimated option exercise behavior and the
employee groupings. Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine
the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the Company began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal
exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted.
Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company's computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of its common stock and implied
volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock, as low trade volume of its tradable forward call options prior to 2011 precluded
sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. The Company believes that implied
volatility of publicly traded options in its common stock is more reﬂective of market conditions, and given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can
reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of its common stock.
In valuing shares issued under the Company’s employee stock option plans, the Company bases the risk-free interest rate on US. Treasury zero-coupon
issues with terms similar to the contractual term of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore
uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model. The Company does not use a post-vesting termination rate as options are fully vested upon
grant date.
