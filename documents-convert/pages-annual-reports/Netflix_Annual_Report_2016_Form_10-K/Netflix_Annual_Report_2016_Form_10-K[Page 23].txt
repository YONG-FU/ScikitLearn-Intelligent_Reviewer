In the Domestic streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our members in
the United States. The increase in our domestic streaming revenues was due to a 12% growth in the average number of paid memberships and an 8% increase in
average monthly revenue per paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 20 16 increased by 15% compared
to the same quarter in prior year. These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and plan mix. In 2016, we
phased out grandfathered pricing and cancellations by members whose grandfathered pricing expired were not material. Our standard plan continues to be the most
pOpular plan choice for new memberships.
The increase in domestic streaming cost of revenues was primarily due to a $335.4 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new
streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. In addition, we had a $33.2 million increase in other costs, such as payment processing
fees and customer service call centers, due to our growing member base.
Domestic marketing expenses increased primarily due to an increase in advertising and public relations spending as well as increased payments to our
partners.
Our Domestic streaming segment had a contribution margin of 36% for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which increased as compared to the contribution
margin of 33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which continued to outpace content and marketing
spending.
