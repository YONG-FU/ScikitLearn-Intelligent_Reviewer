In the International streaming segment, we derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting solely of streaming content to our
members outside the United States. We launched our streaming service in Canada in September 2010 and have expanded our services internationally as shown
below.

Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015
The increase in our international revenues was due to the 57% growth in the average number of paid international memberships and a 4% increase in
average monthly revenue per paying membership. The average monthly revenue per paying membership for the fourth quarter of 20 16 increased by 10% compared
to the same quarter in prior year. These increases in average monthly revenue per paying membership were due to price changes and plan mix, offset partially by
unfavorable ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates. We estimate that international revenues would have been approximately $174 million higher in the year ended
December 31, 2016 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2015. If foreign currency exchange rates
ﬂuctuate more than expected, revenues and average revenue per paying membership may differ from our expectations. Average paid international streaming
memberships accounted for 43% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2016 , as compared to 35% of total average paid streaming
memberships as of December 31, 2015 .
The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $998.5 million increase in content expenses relating to our existing and new streaming
content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased $132.5 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses,
costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees, all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting
from exchange rate
