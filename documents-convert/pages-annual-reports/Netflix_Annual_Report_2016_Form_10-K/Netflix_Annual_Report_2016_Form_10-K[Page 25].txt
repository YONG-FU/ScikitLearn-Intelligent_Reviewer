International marketing expenses increased mainly due to expenses for territories launched in the last eighteen months.
International contribution losses decreased $24.9 million year over year due to growth in paid memberships and revenue, which outpaced the growth in
marketing spending.
Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014
The increase in our international revenues was due to the 66% growth in the average number of paid international memberships offset partially by a 10%
decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership was due to the impact of
exchange rate ﬂuctuations and to a lesser extent the impact of absorbing higher VAT rates across our European markets beginning January 1, 2015. These
decreases were partially offset by our pricing changes and plan mix. We believe international revenues would have been approximately $331 million higher in
2015 if foreign exchange rates had remained consistent with those for the year ended December 31, 2014.
The increase in international cost of revenues was primarily due to a $522.1 million increase in content expenses primarily relating to expenses for territories
launched in the last eighteen months, coupled with existing and new streaming content, including more exclusive and original programming. Other costs increased
$104.2 million primarily due to increases in our streaming delivery expenses, costs associated with our customer service call centers and payment processing fees,
all driven by our growing member base, partially offset by decreases resulting from exchange rate ﬂuctuations. Average paid international streaming memberships
accounted for 35% of total average paid streaming memberships as of December 31, 2015 , as compared to 27% of total average paid streaming memberships as of
December 31, 2014 .
International marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 mainly due to expenses
for territories launched in the last eighteen months.
International contribution losses increased $173.6 million year over year due to our increased spending for our international expansion and the impact of
foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations.

$14.99 per month according to the plan chosen by the member. DVD-by-mail plans differ by the number of DVDs that a member may have out at any given point.
Members electing access to high deﬁnition Blu-ray discs, in addition to standard definition DVDs, pay a surcharge ranging from $2 to $4 per month for our most
popular plans.
The decrease in our domestic DVD revenues was due to a 15% decrease in the average number of paid memberships.
The decrease in domestic DVD cost of revenues was primarily due to a $14.0 million decrease in content expenses and a $32.8 million decrease in delivery

memberships coupled with a decrease in usage by these
