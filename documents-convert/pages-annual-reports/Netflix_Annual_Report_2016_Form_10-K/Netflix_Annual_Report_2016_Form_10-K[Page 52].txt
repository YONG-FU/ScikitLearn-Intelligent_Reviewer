The Company grants fully vested non-qualiﬁed stock options to its employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based

2. Short-term Investments
The Company’s investment policy is consistent with the definition of available-for-sale securities. The Company does not buy and hold securities principally
for the purpose of selling them in the near future. The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return. From time to time, the
Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price. The following tables summarize, by
major security type, the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy and where they are
classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
