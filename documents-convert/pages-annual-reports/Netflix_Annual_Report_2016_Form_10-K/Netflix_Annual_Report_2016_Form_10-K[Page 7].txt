adversely impacted. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as programming that is initially available in the applicable territory on our service
(“original programming”), will typically require more up-front cash payments than other licensing agreements. To the extent membership and/or revenue growth
do not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments and accelerated payment
requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and ﬁxed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our ﬂexibility in planning for, or
reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license content that is not favorably received by consumers in a territory, or
is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-term and ﬁxed cost nature of our content
commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offering quickly and our results of operation may be adversely impacted.
We are devoting more resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original programming, including TV series and movies.
We believe that original programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise attract and retain members. To the
extent our original programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our business, including our brand and
results of operations may be adversely impacted.
If we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.
We are expanding our operations internationally, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and
features related to our service, ramping up our ability to produce original content, as well as continuing to operate our DVD service within the US. As our
international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those
dealing with e-commerce and internet video, as well as differing legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service, we are developing
technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing services. As we ramp up our original content production, we are building out expertise in a number of
disciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, ﬁnance and other resources related to the development and physical production of content. If we are not able to
manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, reﬁning or revising our systems and operational practices related to our streaming
operations and original content, our business may be adversely affected.
We could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.
Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks
that may be different from or incremental to those in the US. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could
adversely affect our business, including:
0 the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences, including licensing a certain portion of our content assets
before we have developed a full appreciation for its performance within a given territory;
- difﬁculties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
0 management distraction;
° political or social unrest and economic instability;
° compliance with US. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt
payments to government officials;
° difﬁculties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;
0 regulatory requirements or government action against our service, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory
requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content in the applicable jurisdiction;
0 less favorable foreign intellectual property laws;
0 adverse domestic or international tax consequences such as those related to repatriation of cash from foreign jurisdictions into the United States, non-
income related taxes such as value-added tax or other indirect taxes, changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations and the related application of
judgment in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain;
- ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates, which we do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge against and which could impact
revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;
