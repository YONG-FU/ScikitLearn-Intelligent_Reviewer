information relating to the price performance of our common stock shall not be deemed “filed” with the Commission or “soliciting material” under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1 93 4 and shall not be incorporated by reference into any such filings.
The following graph compares, for the five year period ended December 31, 2016 , the total cumulative stockholder return on the Company’s common stock,
as adjusted for the Stock Split, with the total cumulative return of the NASDAQ Composite Index, the S&P 500 Index and the RDG Internet Composite Index.
Measurement points are the last trading day of each of the Company’s fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 , December 31, 2012 , December 31, 2013 ,
December 31, 2014 , December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 . Total cumulative stockholder return assumes $100 invested at the beginning of the period in the
Company’s common stock, the stocks represented in the NASDAQ Composite Index, the stocks represented in the S&P 500 Index and the stocks represented in
the RDG Internet Composite Index, respectively, and reinvestment of any dividends. In prior years, the Company used the S&P North American Technology
Internet Index, which was discontinued in March 2016. Accordingly, the Company now uses the RDG Internet Composite Index as a replacement for the
discontinued index. Historical stock price performance should not be relied upon as an indication of future stock price performance.
