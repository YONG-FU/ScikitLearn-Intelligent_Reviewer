Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The
Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-US. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into US. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of
each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these
translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in Stockholders’ equity on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
Prior to January 1, 2015, the functional currency of certain of the Company's European entities was the British pound. The Company changed the functional
currency of these entities to the euro effective January 1, 2015 following the redomiciliation of the European headquarters and the launch of the Netﬂix service in
several signiﬁcant European countries. The change in functional currency was applied prospectively from January 1, 2015. Monetary assets and liabilities have
been remeasured to the euro at current exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities have been remeasured to the euro using the exchange rate effective for
the period in which the balance arose. As a result of this change of functional currency, the Company recorded a $21.8 million cumulative translation adjustment
included in other comprehensive loss for year ended December 31, 2015.
The Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each
period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in interest and other income (expense). Foreign currency transactions resulted in a gain of
$22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and losses of $37.3 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
Earnings Per Share
In June 2015, the Company's Board of Directors declared a seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on July 14, 2015 to all
shareholders of record as of July 2, 2015 ("Stock Split").
Outstanding share and per-share amounts disclosed for all periods provided have been retroactively adjusted to reﬂect the effects of the Stock Split.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the
period. Potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options. The computation of earnings per share is as
follows:
Year ended December 31,

Employee stock options with exercise prices greater than the average market price of the common stock were excluded from the diluted calculation as their
inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. The following table summarizes the potential common shares excluded from the diluted calculation:
