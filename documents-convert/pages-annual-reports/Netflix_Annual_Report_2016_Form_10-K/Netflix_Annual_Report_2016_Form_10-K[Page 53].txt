portfolio and cash equivalents is based on its assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the
measurement date. The fair value of available-for-sale securities and cash equivalents included in the Level 1 category is based on quoted prices that are readily
and regularly available in an active market. The fair value of available-for-sale securities included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as
quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly. These values were obtained from an independent pricing service and were evaluated using pricing models that vary by asset class and may incorporate
available trade, bid and other market information and price quotes from well-established independent pricing vendors and broker-dealers. The Company’s
procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded, such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources. See Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the fair value of the Company’s senior notes.
Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments that are in an unrealized loss position and it is not likely that the Company will be required to
sell any investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Company does not consider those investments with an unrealized loss to be other-than-
temporarily impaired at December 31, 2016 . There were no material other-than-temporary impairments or credit losses related to available-for-sale securities in
the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 or 2014 .
There were no material gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale investments in the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
Realized gains and losses and interest income are included in "Interest and other income (expense)" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
