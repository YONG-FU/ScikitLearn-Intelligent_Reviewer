of, or as a substitute for, net income, operating income, cash ﬂow (used in) provided by operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or
liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
In assessing liquidity in relation to our results of operations, we compare free cash ﬂow to net income, noting that the three major recurring differences are
excess content payments over expense, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other working capital differences. The excess content payments over
expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash
payments, such as licensing and production of original content. In the last 12 months, the ratio of content payments over content expense was 1.4. Working capital
differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and
deferred revenue is a source of cash ﬂow.

Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015
Cash used in operating activities increased $724.5 million resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $1,474.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 . The signiﬁcant net cash used in operations is due primarily to the increase in investments in streaming content that require more upfront
payments. The payments for streaming content assets increased $2,271.4 million, from $4,609.2 million to $6,880.6 million, or 49%. In addition, we had increased
payments associated with higher operating expenses. The increased use of cash was partially offset by a $2,051.2 million or 30% increase in revenues.
Cash provided by investing activities increased $229.0 million, primarily due to an increase of $243.6 million in the proceeds from sales and maturities of
short-term investments, net of purchases, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in the purchases of property and equipment, primarily driven by the expansion
of our Los Gatos, California headquarters, as well as our new office space in Los Angeles, California.
Cash provided by ﬁnancing activities decreased $548.6 million primarily due to the $1,482.4 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% Notes and
the 5.875% Notes in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the $989.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in the year ended
December 31, 2016 .

of favorable other working capital differences.
