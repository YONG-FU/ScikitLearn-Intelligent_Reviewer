Contractual Obligations
For the purpose of this table, contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and
that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; ﬁxed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing
of the transaction. The expected timing of the payment of the obligations discussed below is estimated based on information available to us as of December 31,
2016 . Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for
some obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 :

(1) As of December 31, 2016 , streaming content obligations were comprised of $3.6 billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $2.9 billion of "Non-
current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $8.0 billion of obligations that are not reﬂected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.
Streaming content obligations increased $3.6 billion from $10.9 billion as of December 31, 2015 to $14.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to
multi—year commitments associated with the continued expansion of our exclusive and original programming.
Streaming content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of streaming content. An obligation for the production of
content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content
is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet
determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the US. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the
number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any
estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than ﬁve years. However, these unknown
obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments
for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments
and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations
table above.
(2) Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further
details.
