’Provision for income taxes $ 73,829 $ 19,244 $ 82,570 $ 54,585 284% (63,326) (77)%‘
Effective tax rate 28% 14% 24%
Year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015
The increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves in 2015 and an increase in foreign taxes. In 2016, the difference
between our 28% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $17.3 million primarily due to the 2016 Federal and California research and
development (“R&D”) credits partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes, and nondeductible expenses.
Year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014
The decrease in our effective tax rate is mainly due to an increase in R&D credits and a decrease in state and local income taxes. In 2015, the difference
between our 14% effective tax rate and the Federal statutory rate of 35% was $30.4 million primarily due to a $13.4 million release of tax reserves on previously
unrecognized tax beneﬁts as a result of an IRS audit settlement leading to the reassessment of our reserves for all open years, $16.5 million related to the
retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 Federal R&D credit, as well as the California R&D credit; partially offset by state income taxes, foreign taxes and
nondeductible expenses. On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 20 1 5 (HR. 2029) was signed into law which retroactively and
permanently extended the Federal R&D credit from January 1, 2015. As a result, we recognized the retroactive benefit of the 2015 R&D credit as a discrete item in
the fourth quarter of 20 1 5, the period in which the legislation was enacted.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $576.9 million from $2,310.7 million as of December 31, 2015 to $1,733.8 million as of
December 31, 2016 . In October 2016, we issued $1,000.0 million of long-term debt. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short—term investments in the year
ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in cash used in operations, partially offset by cash received from the issuance of debt. Long-term
debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $3,364.3 million and $2,371.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note 4 to the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements for additional information.
Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery, marketing programs and personnel-related costs.
Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. We expect to
signiﬁcantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and may result in future negative
free cash ﬂows even after we achieve material global proﬁtability.
We currently anticipate that cash ﬂows from operations, together with available funds and access to financing sources, will continue to be sufﬁcient to meet
our cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to obtain any additional ﬁnancing that we may choose to, or need to, obtain will depend on, among
other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, financial condition and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek
ﬁnancing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked
or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience
dilution.
As of December 31, 2016 , cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $278.5 million. If these funds are needed for our
operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay US. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the portion associated with undistributed
earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries.
Free Cash Flow
We define free cash ﬂow as cash provided by (used in) operating and investing activities excluding the non-operational cash ﬂows from purchases, maturities
and sales of short-term investments. We believe free cash ﬂow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash
generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments in content and for certain other activities or the amount of cash used in operations, including
investments in global streaming content. Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure and should not be considered in isolation
