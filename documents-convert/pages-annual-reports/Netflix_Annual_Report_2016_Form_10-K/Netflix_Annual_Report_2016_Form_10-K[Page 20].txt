(1) A membership (also referred to as a subscription or a member) is deﬁned as the right to receive the Netﬂix service following sign-up and a method of
payment being provided. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of sign-up as determined by our internal
systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology. We offer free-trial memberships to new and certain rejoining members. Total members
include those who are on a free-trial as long as a method of payment has been provided. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reﬂected in the above
metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period, while involuntary
cancellation of the service, as a result of a failed method of payment, becomes effective immediately except in limited circumstances where a short grace
period is offered to ensure the streaming service is not interrupted for members who are impacted by payment processing delays by our banks or integrated
payment partners. The number of members in a grace period at any given point is not material.
