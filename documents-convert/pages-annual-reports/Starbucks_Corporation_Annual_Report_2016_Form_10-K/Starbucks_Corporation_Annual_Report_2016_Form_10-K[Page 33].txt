Revenues

by higher sales of premium single-serve products ($101 million). The impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($40 million),
increased foodservice sales ($33 million) and US. packaged coffee sales ($28 million) also contributed.
Operating Expenses

(approximately 140 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales (approximately 100 basis points).
Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage on
marketing expenses and salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points).
Income from equity investees as a percentage of total revenues increased 130 basis points, driven by higher income from our
North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, primarily due to increased sales volume of Starbucks Doubleshot® and
bottled Frappuccino® beverages and new product launches, partially offset by increased marketing costs (approximately 150
basis points).
The combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015.
