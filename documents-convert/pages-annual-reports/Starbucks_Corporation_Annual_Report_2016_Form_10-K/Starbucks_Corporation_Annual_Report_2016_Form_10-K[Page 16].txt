governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.
Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived
to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to
liability. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future
breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for
those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in
the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of ﬁJture attempts to breach our information
technology systems.
Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third party business
partners or service providers, even if no breach has been attempted or has occurred, can also adversely impact our brand and
reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks
and breaches of information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are
often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant
investments in technology, third party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are
designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss,
but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.
° We rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or
security failure of that technology could harm our ability to ejfectively operate our business and could adversely affect our
ﬁnancial results.
We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, including for administrative functions, point-of—sale
processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, mobile
technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and
transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Our ability to effectively
manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, administration and sale of our products depends significantly
on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. We also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these
information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third party
service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in
place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available.
Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective
redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, ﬂaws in third party software or
services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms,
including through cyber-attacks discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery
and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to
our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results.
- We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have
an adverse impact on our business and ﬁnancial results.
There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations,
which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to create
growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:
° being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;
° building our leadership position around coffee, including through the development of Starbucks Reserve® Roasteries
and Starbucks Reserve® stores;
- increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing ﬂexible and
unique store formats;
0 creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and
beverage product lineup;
° continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business;
0 delivering continued growth in our tea business through the Teavana brand; and
0 driving convenience and brand engagement through our mobile, loyalty and digital capabilities.
In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of
these initiatives, which could adversely impact our business and financial results, include the following:
- increases in labor costs, both domestically and internationally, such as general market and minimum wage levels and
investing in competitive compensation, increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs and other
