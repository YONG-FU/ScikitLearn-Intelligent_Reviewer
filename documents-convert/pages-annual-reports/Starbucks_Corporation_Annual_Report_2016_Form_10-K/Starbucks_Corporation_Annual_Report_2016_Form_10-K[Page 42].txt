In May 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of
lO-year 2.450% Senior Notes (the "2026 notes") due June 2026. We will use the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our
sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management through Eligible Sustainability Projects. Interest on the 2026
notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2016.
In February 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of
5-year 2.100% Senior Notes (the "2021 notes”) due February 2021. In May 2016, we reopened this offering with the same terms
and issued an additional $250 million of Senior Notes (collectively, the "2021 notes") for an aggregate amount outstanding of
$750 million. Interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on February 4 and August 4 of each year, commencing
on August 4, 2016.
See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the
components of our long-term debt.
The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants,
including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 2, 2016, we
were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
Use of Cash
We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under
the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product
innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock
cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses.
Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also
seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda.
Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership
interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.
We believe that ﬁJture cash ﬂows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and
internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as
shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business
opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have
the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the
ﬁJture.
We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of October 2, 2016 to be
indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no US. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings.
We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the US. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the
event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the US, we would be subject to additional US. income
taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is
a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the
time of repatriation, tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.
During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.16 per share.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 we declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per
share. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2016 and 2015 totaled $l,178.0 million and $958.7 million,
respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on December 2,
2016 with an expected payout of approximately $365.1 million.
During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 34.9 million and 29.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $2.0
billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. On April 21, 2016, we announced that our
Board of Directors approved an increase of 100 million shares to the program. Including this additional authorization of 100
million shares, the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at October 2, 2016 totaled 117.8 million.
Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2017 are expected to consist primarily of capital
expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing
company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional
investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion.
