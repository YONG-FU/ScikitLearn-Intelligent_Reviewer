Note 12: Employee Stock and Beneﬁt Plans
We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs") or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and
consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an
employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").
As of October 2, 2016, there were 86.7 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based
compensation awards and 13.9 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP.

Stock Option Plans
Stock options to purchase our common stock are granted at the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The majority of options
become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant
date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest over one to three years. Nearly all outstanding stock options are
non-qualified stock options.
The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for
fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014:

IWeighted average grant price $ 60.20 $ 39.89 $ 40.12 I
Estimated fair value per option granted $ 10.54 $ 6.58 $ 8.36
The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of
similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.
Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility
of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on
US. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated
cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect
of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.
