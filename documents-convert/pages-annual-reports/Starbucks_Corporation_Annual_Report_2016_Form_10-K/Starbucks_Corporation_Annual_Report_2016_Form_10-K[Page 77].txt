agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. Borrowings
under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for US. dollar-denominated loans under
certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable
margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating
agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. The
current applicable margin is 0.565% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility
contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all
applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of October 2, 2016.
Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount
outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our
credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working
capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of
cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2016, availability under our commercial paper
program was approximately $1 billion (which represents the ﬁll committed credit facility amount, as no amounts were
outstanding under our commercial paper program).
Long-term Debt
In May 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of
10-year 2.450% Senior Notes (the "2026 notes") due June 2026. Interest on the 2026 notes is payable semi—annually on June 15
and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2016.
In February 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of
5-year 2.100% Senior Notes (the "2021 notes”) due February 2021. In May 2016, we reopened this offering with the same
terms and issued an additional $250 million of Senior Notes (collectively, the "2021 notes”) for an aggregate amount
outstanding of $750 million. Interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on February 4 and August 4 of each year,
commencing on August 4, 2016.
In July 2015, we redeemed our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the "2017 notes") originally scheduled to mature in
August 2017. The redemption resulted in a charge of $61.1 million, which is presented separately as loss on extinguishment of
debt within other income and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. This loss primarily relates to the optional
redemption payment as outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as non-cash expenses related to the previously capitalized
original issuance costs and accelerated amortization of the unamortized discount. In connection with the redemption, we also
reclassified $2.0 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense on our consolidated statements of
earnings related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts entered into in conjunction with the 2017 notes
and designated as cash ﬂow hedges.
In June 2015, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 7-year
2.700% Senior Notes (the "2022 notes") due June 2022, and $350 million of 30-year 4.300% Senior Notes (the "2045 notes")
due June 2045. Interest on the 2022 and 2045 notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year,
commencing on December 15, 2015.
