Total net revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 17%, over fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased revenues from company-
operated stores (contributing $2.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by
incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan ($1.1 billion), an increase in comparable store sales (7% growth,
or $852 million) and incremental revenues from 550 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12
months ($590 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($252
million).
Licensed store revenue growth also contributed $273 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from the
opening of 1,075 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales as well as
increased La Boulange food sales to our licensees in the Americas segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease
in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($45 million).
CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve
products ($116 million), US. packaged coffee ($55 million) and foodservice sales ($40 million).
