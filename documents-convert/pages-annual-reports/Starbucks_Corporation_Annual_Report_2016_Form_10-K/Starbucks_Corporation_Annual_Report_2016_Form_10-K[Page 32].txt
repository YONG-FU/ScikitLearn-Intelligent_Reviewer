Revenues
EMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased $92 million, or 8%. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in
company-operated store revenues ($179 million), which was largely due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region ($132
million) and includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our Germany retail operations, and unfavorable foreign
currency translation ($69 million). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($18
million).
Licensed store revenues increased $82 million, or 32%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our
licensees ($89 million), resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company-operated
stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months. Also contributing was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($6
million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($12 million).
Qperating Expenses
Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 230 basis points, primarily due to the
shift in composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores (approximately 140 basis points), sales
deleverage at certain company-owned stores (approximately 80 basis points) and foreign currency transactions (approximately
50 basis points).
Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 220 basis points. As a percentage of company-
operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 170 basis points, primarily due to costs associated with the sale of
our Germany retail operations and a decrease in company-operated store sales as a result of the shift to more licensed stores in
the region (approximately 70 basis points). Sales deleverage at certain company-owned stores, largely related to salaries and
benefits, also contributed unfavorably (approximately 70 basis points).
Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-
operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 250 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by the shift
to more licensed stores in the region (approximately 250 basis points).
Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to the
shift in the composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).
Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points as a result of the sale of our
ownership interest in our Spanish joint venture, Starbucks Coffee Espaﬁa, S.L., in the first quarter of fiscal 2016
(approximately 20 basis points).
The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points over fiscal 2015.
