and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail
centers, office buildings, university campuses and in select rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of
our stores, inclusive of Drive Thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store
formats, which are focused on an elevated Starbucks Experience for our customers.
Starbucks® stores offer a choice of coffee and tea beverages, as well as other premium coffee, tea and related products,
including distinctively packaged roasted whole bean and ground coﬁees, a variety of premium single-serve and ready-to-drink
coffee and tea products, juices and bottled water. Starbucks® stores also offer an assortment of fresh food and snack offerings,
including selections focusing on high-quality ingredients, nutritional value and great ﬂavor. A focused selection of beverage-
making equipment and accessories are also sold in our stores. Each Starbucks® store varies its product mix depending upon the
size of the store and its location. To complement the in—store experience, our company—operated Starbucks® stores in the US,
Canada and certain other international markets also provide customers free access to wireless internet.
