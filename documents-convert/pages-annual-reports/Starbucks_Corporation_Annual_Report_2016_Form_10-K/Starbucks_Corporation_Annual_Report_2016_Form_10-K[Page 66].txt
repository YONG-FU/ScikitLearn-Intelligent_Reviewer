The intangible assets are finite-lived and include reacquired rights, licensing agreements with Starbucks Japan's current

using an average of the income and market approach. The income approach fair value measurement was based on significant
inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in estimating ﬁJture cash ﬂows included projected revenue growth and operating expenses,
as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses were based on internal
projections and considered the historical performance of stores, local market economics and the business environment impacting
