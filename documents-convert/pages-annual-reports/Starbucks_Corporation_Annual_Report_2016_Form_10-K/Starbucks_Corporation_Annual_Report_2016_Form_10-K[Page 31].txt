Revenues
China/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $543 million, or 23%, largely due to increased revenues from
company-operated stores (contributing $513 million). The increase in company-operated store revenues was primarily due to
the opening of 359 net new company—operated stores over the past 12 months ($246 million) and incremental revenues from the
impact of our ownership in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Also contributing was a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($61
million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($52 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($49 million).
Licensed store revenues increased $28 million, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees
($47 million), resulting from the opening of 622 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months, partially offset by
unfavorable foreign currency translation ($15 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of
our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million).
Qperating Expenses
Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to the
impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points) and favorability from changes to certain
business tax structures in China (30 basis points).
Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated
store revenues, store operating expenses increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments
and payroll-related expenditures (approximately 90 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan
(approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 60 basis points).
Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-
operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll-related
expenditures (approximately 140 basis points), investments in digital platforms (approximately 80 basis points) and the impact
of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately
220 basis points).
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage
on salaries and benefits (approximately 40 basis points).
Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to higher income
from our joint venture operations, primarily in China and South Korea (approximately 70 basis points and 60 basis points,
respectively), partially offset by the shift in composition of our store portfolio to more company-operated stores (approximately
50 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 50 basis points).
The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 60 basis points over fiscal 2015.
