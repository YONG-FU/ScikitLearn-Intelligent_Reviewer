We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 2,
2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
Interest Rate Risk
Long-term Debi
We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related
to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash ﬂows due to changes in benchmark interest rates
related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and
details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 2, 2016.
The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 2, 2016 on the fair value of Starbucks

Available-for-Sale Securities
Our available-for—sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The
primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for—sale securities are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for—sale securities. We performed a
sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for—sale securities as of
October 2, 2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.
APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make
estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those
policies may result in materially diﬁerent amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.
Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the
following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.
We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate
and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past three fiscal years, we
have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted
otherwise.
