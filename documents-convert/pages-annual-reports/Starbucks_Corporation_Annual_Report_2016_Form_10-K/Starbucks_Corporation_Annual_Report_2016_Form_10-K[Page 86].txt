Note 16: Segment Reporting
Our chief executive officer and chief operating officer comprise the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker function
("CODM"). Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our CODM manages the segments, evaluates financial
results, and makes key operating decisions.
We have four reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America; 2) China/Asia
Pacific ("CAP"); 3) Europe, Middle East, and Africa ("EMEA") and 4) Channel Development.
Americas, CAP, and EMEA operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve
coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Our Americas
segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our CAP and EMEA operations
are still in the early stages of development and require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of
revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. The Americas, CAP and EMEA segments also include certain
foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada, Japan and the UK.
Channel Development operations sell a selection of packaged coffees and single-serve products, as well as a selection of
premium Tazo® teas globally. Channel Development operations also produce and sell a variety of ready-to-drink beverages,
such as Frappuccino® coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot® espresso drinks, Starbucks Refreshers® beverages and chilled
multi-serve beverages. The US. foodservice business, which is included in the Channel Development segment, sells coffee and
other related products to institutional foodservice companies.
