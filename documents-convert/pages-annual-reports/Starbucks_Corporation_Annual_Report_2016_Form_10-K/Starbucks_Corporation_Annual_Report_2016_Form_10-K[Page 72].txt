Available-for-sale Securities
Long-term investments generally mature within 4 years. Proceeds from sales of available-for—sale securities were $680.7
million, $600.6 million, and $1.5 billion for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2014 was due
to the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in anticipation
of funding the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Realized gains and losses on sales and maturities of available-for—sale securities
were not material for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for—sale
securities were not material as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.
