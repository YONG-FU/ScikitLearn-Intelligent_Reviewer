the stores' performance. The discount rate applied was based on Starbucks Japan's weighted-average cost of capital and included
a company-specific risk premium. The market approach fair value measurement was based on the implied fair value of Starbucks
Japan using the purchase price of Sazaby's 39.5% ownership interest and the expected purchase price of the 21% remaining
noncontrolling interest.
We began consolidating Starbucks Japan's results of operations and cash ﬂows into our consolidated financial statements
beginning after October 31, 2014. For the year ended September 27, 2015, Starbucks Japan's net revenues and net earnings
included in our consolidated statement of earnings were $1.1 billion and $108.5 million, respectively.
The following table provides the supplemental pro forma revenue and net earnings of the combined entity had the acquisition
date of Starbucks Japan been the first day of our first quarter of fiscal 2014 rather than during our first quarter of fiscal 2015 (in
millions):

(1) The pro forma net earnings attributable to Starbucks for fiscal 2014 includes the acquisition-related gain of $390.6 million
and transaction and integration costs of $13.6 million for the year ended September 28, 2014.
The amounts in the supplemental pro forma earnings for the periods presented above ﬁJlly eliminate intercompany transactions,
apply our accounting policies and reﬂect adjustments for additional occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization that would
have been charged assuming the same fair value adjustments to leases, property, plant and equipment and acquired intangibles
had been applied on September 30, 2013. These pro forma results are unaudited and are not necessarily indicative of results of
operations that would have occurred had the acquisition actually occurred in the prior year period or indicative of the results of
operations for any future period.
Fiscal 2014
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold our Australian company-operated retail store assets and operations to the
Withers Group, converting these operations to a fully licensed market, for a total of $15.9 million. This transaction resulted in
an insignificant pre-tax gain, which was included in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings.
Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments
Interest Rates
Depending on market conditions, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash ﬂows due to
changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the
pricing of the related debt. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income ("AOCI") and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt.
During fiscal 2016, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $375
million related to the $500 million and $250 million of 5-year 2.100% Senior Notes (the "2021 notes") due February 2021 and
$500 million of 10-year 2.450% Senior Notes (the "2026 notes”) due June 2026. Refer to Note 9, Debt, for details of the
components of our long-term debt. We cash settled these swap agreements at the time of pricing the 2021 and 2026 notes.
Foreign Currency
To reduce cash ﬂow volatility from foreign currency ﬂuctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions
of cash ﬂows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending
activities. The effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to revenue,
cost of sales including occupancy costs or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposure affects net
earnings.
In connection with the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, as discussed in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, we entered into
cross-currency swap contracts during the first and third quarters of fiscal 2015 to hedge the foreign currency transaction risk of
certain yen-denominated intercompany loans with a total notional value of ¥86.5 billion, or approximately $717 million as of
September 27, 2015. As of October 2, 2016, the total notional value of these cross-currency swap contracts was ¥66.8 billion,
or approximately, $660 million. Gains and losses from these swaps offset the changes in value of interest and principal
