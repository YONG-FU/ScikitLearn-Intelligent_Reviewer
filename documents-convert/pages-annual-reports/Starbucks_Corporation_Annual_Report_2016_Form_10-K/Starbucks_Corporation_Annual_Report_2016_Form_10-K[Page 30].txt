Revenues
Americas total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $1.5 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-
operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion) and licensed stores (contributing $184 million).
The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales ($730 million),
incremental revenues from 348 net new StarbucksÂ® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($481 million)
and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($258 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign
currency translation ($91 million), primarily driven by the strengthening of the US. dollar against the Canadian dollar.
The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees
($150 million), resulting from the opening of 456 net newlicensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable
store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($31 million).
Qperating Expenses
Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by
leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 50 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 40
basis points).
Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated
store revenues, store operating expenses increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in store partners
and digital platforms (approximately 100 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately
80 basis points).
Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-
operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 280 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 140 basis points), the lapping of
impairment of certain assets in the region (approximately 60 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 40
basis points).
The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 110 basis points over fiscal 2015.
