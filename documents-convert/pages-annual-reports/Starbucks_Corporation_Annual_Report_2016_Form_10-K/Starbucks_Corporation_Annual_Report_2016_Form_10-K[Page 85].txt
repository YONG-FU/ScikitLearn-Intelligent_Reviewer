Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options
(both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares
outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market
price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. We had 5.4 million and 5.3
million out—of-the-money stock options as of October 2, 2016 and September 28, 2014, respectively. There were no
out-of—the-money stock options as of September 27, 2015.
Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
On November 12, 2013, the arbitrator in our arbitration with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (now known as Kraft Foods Group, Inc.)
("Kraft") ordered Starbucks to pay Kraft $2,227.5 million in damages plus prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. We
estimated prejudgment interest, which included an accrual through the estimated payment date, and attorneys' fees to be
approximately $556.6 million. As a result, we recorded a litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in our fiscal 2013 operating
results, and in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Starbucks paid all amounts due to Kraft under the arbitration including
prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees, and fully extinguished the litigation charge liability. Of the $2,784.1 million litigation
charge accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, $2,763.9 million was paid, and the remainder was released as a litigation
credit to reﬂect a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable as a result of paying our obligation earlier than
anticipated.
Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, at times, certain
employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but is not currently a party to any legal
