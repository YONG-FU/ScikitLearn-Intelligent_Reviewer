results. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we or our licensees or other
business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible
manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products or the use of customer data, fail to comply with
laws and regulations or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing
to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well. Additionally,
inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property,
including from unauthorized uses of our brand or other of our intellectual property assets, can erode consumer trust and our
brand value and have a negative impact on our financial results.
- Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as
well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health ejfects of consuming our products, could harm our business.
Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne
illnesses, tampering, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation,
have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service
restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne
illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and
severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class
actions) or damages. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages and our ability to ensure a
clean water supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to
incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, including produce (such as
fruits and vegetables in our salads and juices), dairy products (such as milk and cheeses), non-dairy alternative products (such
as soymilk and almondmilk) and meats. Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller
suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more
national suppliers. If customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, contamination, mislabeling or
other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well
as recall products. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores
of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could,
by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or
global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a
temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm
our business and results of operations.
Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are
the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products,
sugar and other compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer
awareness of health risks, including obesity, due in part to increased publicity and attention from health organizations, as well
as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage
products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories,
an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, or
negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and
food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations.
- The unauthorized access, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks
proprietary or conﬁdential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could
impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.
Our information technology systems, such as those we use for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including online
and mobile payment systems and rewards programs, and for administrative ﬁanctions, including human resources, payroll,
accounting and internal and external communications, as well as the information technology systems of our third party business
partners and service providers, can contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and
employees. Our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related
to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies
and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology
systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party’s information
technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of
the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber—attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a
material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new
customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of
applicable US. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and
