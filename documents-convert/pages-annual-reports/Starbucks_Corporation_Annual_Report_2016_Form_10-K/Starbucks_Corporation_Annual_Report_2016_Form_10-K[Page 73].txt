Trading Securities
Trading securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our trading securities portfolio approximates a

MDCP liability was $101.5 million and $98.3 million as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. The changes
in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the trading securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal years 2016 and 2014
were net gains of $3.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and a net loss of $4.5 million in fiscal year 2015. Gross unrealized
holding gains and losses on trading securities were not material as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015.

As of October 2, 2016, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $466 million under fixed-price contracts and an
estimated $641 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. As of October 2, 2016, approximately $7 million of our price-to-be—
fixed contracts were effectively fixed through the use of futures contracts. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase
commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and
therefore the price, at which the base "C" coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For
most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to "fix" the base "C" coffee commodity price prior to the delivery
date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base "C" coffee
commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on
relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote.
