assets in the region (approximately 150 basis points) as well as decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, driven by the
shift to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).
Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-
operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the gains on the sales of
certain assets in the region (approximately 40 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points).
These decreases were partially offset by increased costs to grow our non-retail operations in the region (approximately 50 basis
points), largely driven by higher marketing costs.
The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 460 basis points over fiscal 2014.
