Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-
operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 50 basis points), the lapping of
impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points) and improved collection
results (approximately 20 basis points).
General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher
salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points).
Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points due to higher income from our
joint venture operations, primarily from our North American Coffee Partnership and our joint ventures in China and South
Korea.
The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2015.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5%
ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of
6.250% Senior Notes (the "2017 notes"), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates
to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized
issuance costs and unamortized discount.
Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value
card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange ï¬‚uctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities
portfolio ($8 million).
Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016.
Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn
in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The
effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was
primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5%
ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.
