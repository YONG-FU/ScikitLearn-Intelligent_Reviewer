Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
General
Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with
the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years ended on September 27, 2015 and September 28, 2014 both
included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 531rd week. All references to store
counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.
Financial Highlights
- Total net revenues increased 11% to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $19.2 billion in fiscal 2015.
° Global comparable store sales grew 5% driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in the number of
transactions.
- Consolidated operating income increased to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to operating income of $3.6 billion in
fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 operating margin was 19.6% compared to 18.8% in fiscal 2015. Operating margin expansion in
fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in
partners (employees) and digital platforms.
- Earnings per share ("EPS") for fiscal 2016 increased to $1.90 and included $0.06 per share for the extra week in fiscal
2016. Fiscal 2015 EPS was $1.82 and included $0.26 per share from the gain on the fair value adjustment of our
preexisting equity interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition.
- Cash ﬂows from operations were $4.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015. The change was
primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for Starbucks Japan and the
timing of our cash payments for income taxes.
- Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015.
° We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2016 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $2.4
billion in fiscal 2015.
Overview
Starbucks results for fiscal 2016 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to
successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). Our net revenues grew 11% over
fiscal 2015, and consolidated operating margin expanded 80 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.6% in fiscal 2016,
largely driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our partners and digital
platforms.
The Americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2016, with revenues growing 11% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven
by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in number of
transactions, incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the last 12 months and the impact of the extra week in
fiscal 2016. Growth in our iced beverages, including coffee, tea and espresso, paired with beverage innovation and the success
of our food offerings, drove the increase in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 110 basis points to 25.3%
in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our store
partners and digital platforms.
Our fiscal 2016 China/Asia Pacific segment results reﬂected higher revenues from the opening of 981 net new stores over the
past year, incremental revenues associated with the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, a 3% increase in comparable store
sales and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales
leverage, higher income from our joint venture operations and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures in
China. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of our ownership
change in Starbucks Japan. We now operate 6,443 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment with continued
strong performance, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.
As we continue to execute our strategy of achieving the appropriate balance between company—operated and licensed stores,
our EMEA segment revenues declined 8% to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to a year ago. The decline in revenues was
primarily driven by lower company-operated store revenues due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region and
unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting lower company-operated store revenues were higher licensed store
sales, primarily resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company—operated stores to
licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Compared to fiscal 2015, EMEA
operating margin declined 30 basis points to 13.5% primarily due to sales deleverage at certain company-operated stores and
