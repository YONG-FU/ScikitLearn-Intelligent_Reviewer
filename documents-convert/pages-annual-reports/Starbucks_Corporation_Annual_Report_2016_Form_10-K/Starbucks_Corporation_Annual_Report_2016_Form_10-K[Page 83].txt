Deferred Compensation Plan
We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal
year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted
stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material.
Deﬁned Contribution Plans
We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in
the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the
plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws.
Our matching contributions to all US. and non-US. plans were $86.2 million, $70.9 million and $73.0 million in fiscal years
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
