FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and Investment Overview
Our cash and investments were $3.4 billion and $1.9 billion as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. We
actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal
payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend
payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for—sale securities,
including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), mortgage and asset-backed
securities, state and local government obligations and agency obligations. As of October 2, 2016, approximately $1.6 billion of
cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.
Borrowing capacity:
In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we replaced our 2013 credit facility with our new $1.5 billion unsecured, revolving 2016
credit facility (the "credit facility") with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit.
The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions
and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on November 6, 2020. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and
agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. Borrowings
under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for US. dollar-denominated loans under
certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable
margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating
agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. The
current applicable margin is 0.565% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility
contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all
applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of October 2, 2016.
Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount
outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.
Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our
credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working
capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of
cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2016, we had no borrowings under our
commercial paper program.
