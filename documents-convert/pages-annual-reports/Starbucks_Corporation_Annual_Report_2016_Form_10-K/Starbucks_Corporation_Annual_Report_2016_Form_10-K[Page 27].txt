unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more
licensed stores.
The Channel Development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sales of premium
single-serve products, driven by sales of Starbucks® K—Cup® portion packs, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and
increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales. Operating margin increased 400 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by
strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, lower coffee costs and leverage on cost of sales.
As seen through our Channel Development segment results for fiscal 2016, we continue to expand customer occasions outside
of our retail stores and through our developing international presence.
Fiscal 2017 The View Ahead
Turning to fiscal 2017, we expect continued strength in our revenue, operating margin and earnings per share results in
comparison to fiscal 2016. These results are expected to be driven by our 7 Strategies for Growth, which include:
0 Be the Employer of Choice
- Elevate Coffee
° Grow the Store Portfolio
0 Create New Customer Occasions
- Drive At—Home Coffee Share and Occasions
- Build Teavana through Starbucks and CPG
- Extend Digital Engagement
In fiscal 2017, through our 7 Strategies for Growth, we plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the
mix and types of stores in our portfolio. Expansion of our store portfolio is expected to be coupled with continued customer
attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts. And, our management team continues to align our leadership with our
evolving businesses, including the development of our Global Roastery and Starbucks Reserve® branded stores. As a result of
these efforts, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 8% in fiscal 2017 when compared to our 53-week
results in fiscal 2016. After excluding the approximately $400 million of additional revenue attributed to the extra week in
fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 10% for fiscal 2017 based on a comparable 52-week
year. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales in the mid-single digits and the opening of
approximately 2,100 net new stores globally.
Additionally, for fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in our partners and digital platforms. These investments provide
enhanced wages and benefits and also focus on mobile and loyalty programs. We expect partner and digital investments to
increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in fiscal 2016, further demonstrating
the importance of and value creation realized from these efforts.
We plan for our consolidated operating margin to increase slightly in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. Sales leverage
and cost savings initiatives will offset investments in our business and partners. For fiscal 2017, we expect an effective tax rate
of about 34%, and diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.09 to $2.11.
Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily for new stores and store
renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.
