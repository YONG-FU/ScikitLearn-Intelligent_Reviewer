Cash Flows
Cash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $3.7 billion for fiscal 2015. The change was
primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for Starbucks Japan and the timing of
our cash payments for income taxes.
Cash used by investing activities totaled $2.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015. The change was
primarily due to the increase in purchases of investments, primarily government treasury securities and corporate debt
securities, partially offset by the lapping of cash used to acquire Sazaby's 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan.
Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2016 totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for fiscal 2015 . The change was
primarily due to the lapping of long-term debt redemption in fiscal 2015, higher incremental proceeds from long-term debt
issued in February and May 2016 over prior year's issuance and lapping of cash used to fund the second tender offer step of the
Starbucks Japan acquisition. These reductions in cash used were partially offset by increased cash returned to shareholders
through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2015.

(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate
of the amount and period of related future payments. As of October 2, 2016, we had $154.2 million of gross
unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.
(2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.
(3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on
Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coﬁee purchase commitments comprise 90% of total purchase
obligations.
(4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging
instruments.
Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash ﬂows generated in the normal course of
business.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.
COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS
Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products,
among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabz'ca coffee and related products and risk arises from the price
volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of
our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we
expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact ﬁJture results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in
Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.
