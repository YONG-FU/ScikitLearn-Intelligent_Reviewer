US. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $3.3 billion of cumulative undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity investees. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these
amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US. income
taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings
is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation, and the amount of liability, if any, is dependent
on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.

(1) We have adjusted the presentation of certain gross deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 27, 2015 in the above
table to conform to our presentation as of October 2, 2016.
The valuation allowance as of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015 is primarily related to net operating losses and other
deferred tax assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries. The net change in the total valuation allowance was a decrease of $73.4
million and $23.1 million for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of October 2, 2016, we had state tax credit carryforwards of $24.9 million with an expiration date of fiscal 2024 and foreign
net operating loss carryforwards of $264.2 million, the majority of which has no expiration date.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of October 2, 2016, we had $146.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $102.0 million, if recognized, would
affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a benefit of $3.6 million, an expense of $0.7 million and an expense of $5.9 million
of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. As of October 2, 2016 and September 27, 2015, we had accrued interest and penalties of $7.7 million and $11.3
million, respectively, before the benefit of the federal tax deduction, included within other long-term liabilities on our
consolidated balance sheets.
