Revenues
EMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in
company-operated store revenues ($103 million), which was largely due to unfavorable foreign currency translation ($94

which includes net store closures as well as the absence of revenues from the conversion of certain stores in the UK. from
company-operated to licensed. This decline was partially offset by 4% growth in comparable store sales.
Licensed store revenues increased $19 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our
licensees ($45 million), resulting from the opening of 238 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved

Qperating Expenses
Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 210 basis points, primarily due to
favorable foreign currency exchange (approximately 130 basis points). We buy and sell products, primarily roasted coffee, in

generated favorable foreign currency exchange for fiscal 2015 resulting in a benefit in cost of sales. Sales leverage
(approximately 40 basis points) also contributed to the decrease.
Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 290 basis points. As a percentage of company-
operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 220 basis points primarily due to gains on the sales of certain store
