Total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company—operated
stores (contributing $1.6 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in
comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings
over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues
from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the
absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of
unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million).
Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher
product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks®
licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved
comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). Partially offsetting these increases
was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting
from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million).
CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $214 million, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products
($106 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($47 million), and increased foodservice sales ($34 million) and
US. packaged coffee ($32 million).

basis points).
