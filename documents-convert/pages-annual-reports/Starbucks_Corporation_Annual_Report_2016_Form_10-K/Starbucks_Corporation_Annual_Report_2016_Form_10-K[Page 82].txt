RSUs
We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and non—
employee directors and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the
employee’s continuing employment or the non-employee director's continuing service. The majority of time-vested RSUs vest
in two equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible
employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the
performance period and the grantee remains employed during the subsequent vesting period. The majority of performance-
based RSUs vest in two equal annual installments beginning two years from the grant date.
