STRAYER EDUCATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
If an institution is notified by the Secretary of Education that a program could become ineligible, based on its final rates, for
the next award year:
0 The institution must provide a warning with respect to the program to students and prospective students indicating,
among other things, that students may not be able to use Title IV funds to attend or continue in the program; and
o The institution must not enroll, register or enter into a ﬁnancial commitment with a prospective student until a specified
time after providing the warning to the prospective student.
The new regulation also requires institutions annually to report student- and program-level data to the Department of
Education, and comply with additional disclosure requirements. Final regulations adOpted by the Department of Education, which
generally became effective on July 1, 2011, require an institution to use a template designed by the Department of Education to
disclose to prospective students, with respect to each gainful employment program, occupations that the program prepares
students to enter, total cost of the program, on-time graduation rate, job placement rate, if applicable, and the median loan debt of
program completers for the most recently completed award year. The regulation effective July 1, 2015 expands upon those
existing disclosure requirements and institutions must update their disclosure templates to comply by April 3, 2017.
In addition, the gainful employment regulation requires institutions to certify, among other things, that each eligible gainful
employment program is programmatically accredited if required by a federal governmental entity or a state governmental entity
of a state in which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval. Institutions also must certify that each eligible
program satisﬁes the applicable educational prerequisites for professional licensure or certification requirements in each state in
which it is located or is otherwise required to obtain state approval, so that a student who completes the program and seeks
employment in that state qualifies to take any licensure or certiﬁcation exam that is needed for the student to practice or find
employment in an occupation that the program prepares students to enter. The University has timely made the required
certification.
Under the gainful employment regulation, an institution may establish a new program’s Title IV eligibility by updating the
list of the institution’s programs maintained by the Department of Education. However, an institution may not update its list of
eligible programs to include a failing or zone program that the institution voluntarily discontinued or became ineligible, or a
gainful employment program that is substantially similar to such a program, until three years after the loss of eligibility or
discontinuance.
The requirements associated with the gainful employment regulations may substantially increase the Company’s
administrative burdens and could affect our program offerings, student enrollment, persistence and retention. Further, although
the regulations provide opportunities for an institution to correct any potential deficiencies in a program prior to the loss of Title
IV eligibility, the continuing eligibility of the Company’s academic programs will be affected by factors beyond management’s
control such as changes in the Company’s graduates’ income levels, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest
rates, changes in the percentage of former students who are current in the repayment of their student loans, and various other
factors. Even if the Company were able to correct any deﬁciency in the gainful employment metrics in a timely manner, the
disclosure requirements associated with a program’s failure to meet at least one metric may adversely affect student enrollments
in that program and may adversely affect the reputation of the University.
