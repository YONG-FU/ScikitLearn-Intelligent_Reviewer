are included in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income. The Company recognized $0.1 million of

It is reasonably possible that approximately $0.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced in the next twelve
months due to expiration of the applicable statutes of limitations. The Company does not anticipate signiﬁcant changes to other
unrecognized tax benefits.
As of December 31, 2016, $0.2 million of the Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits would favorably affect the
Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. If amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by taxing authorities,
the Company would record additional income tax expense.
A reconciliation between the Company’s statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2014,
2015, and 2016 is as follows:
