As of February 1, 2017, there were 11,093,489 shares of common stock outstanding, and approximately 90 holders of record.
We did not pay a regular quarterly dividend in 2015 or 2016. On February 14, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an
annual cash dividend of $1.00 per common share. This annual dividend will result in a quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per
common share. Whether to declare dividends and the amount of dividends to be paid in the future will be reviewed periodically
by our Board of Directors in light of our earnings, cash ﬂow, financial condition, capital needs, investment opportunities and
regulatory considerations. There is no requirement or assurance that common dividends will be paid in the future.
