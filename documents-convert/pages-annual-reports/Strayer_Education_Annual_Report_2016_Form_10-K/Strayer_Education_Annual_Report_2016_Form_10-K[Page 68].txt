on its technical merits, is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Upon determination, uncertain
tax positions are measured to determine the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate
settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position is derecognized if it no
longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained.
The tax years 2013-2016 remain open for Federal tax examination and the tax years 2012-2016 remain open to examination
by state and local taxing jurisdictions in which the Company is subject.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the ﬁnancial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the period reported. The most signiﬁcant
management estimates included allowances for doubtful accounts, the useful lives of property and equipment, fair value of future
contractual operating lease obligations, potential sublease income and vacancy periods, accrued expenses, forfeiture rates and the
likelihood of achieving performance criteria for stock-based awards, value of free courses earned by students that will be
redeemed in the future, valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and the interest rate swap arrangement, fair value of contingent
consideration, and the provision for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and the change in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap, net of
income taxes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU N0. 2015- 17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes
(“ASU 2015-17”). The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classiﬁed as noncurrent in a classified
statement of ﬁnancial position. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 effective January 1, 2016 and reclassiﬁed approximately
$6.4 million of its deferred tax asset from current to non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015,
to conform to the current period presentation.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (“ASU 2016-02”). The new guidance requires the recognition
of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases. Under current guidance, operating leases are off-
balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 also requires more extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements.
ASU 2016-02 applies to ﬁscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, using the modiﬁed retrospective method, with early
adoption permitted. The Company anticipates that the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated balance sheet will be material
as the Company will record significant asset and liability balances in connection with its leased properties.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee
Share-Based PaymentAccounting (“ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including classiﬁcation of certain items on the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows and accounting for
income taxes. Specifically, ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax beneﬁts and tax deﬁciencies to be recognized as income tax expense
or benefit in earnings. In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows companies to recognize the impact of stock award forfeitures at the time
of forfeiture, rather than as an estimate ratably over the life of awards. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09, effective January 1, 2017, which may
introduce signiﬁcant volatility to the Company’s provision for income taxes
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU 2014-09”). The standard
establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of
