The Company measures the above items on a recurring basis at fair value as follows:
0 Money market funds — Classified in Level 1 is excess cash the Company holds in both taxable and tax-exempt money
market funds and are included in cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
Company records any net unrealized gains and losses for changes in fair value as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2015
and 2016, approximate fair value and are not disclosed in the above tables because of the short—term nature of the
financial instruments.
0 Deferred payments — The Company acquired certain assets and entered into deferred payment arrangements with the
sellers in transactions in 2011 and January 2016, which are classified within Level 3 as there is no liquid market for
similarly priced instruments. The deferred payments are valued using a discounted cash ﬂow model that encompasses
significant unobservable inputs to estimate the operating results of the acquired assets. The assumptions used include
estimates for interest rates, enrollment growth, retention rates, obtaining regulatory approvals for expansion into new

31, 2016 and is included in accounts payable and accrued expense.

but is not deemed a fair value liability as the future lease payments are required to be discounted using the
