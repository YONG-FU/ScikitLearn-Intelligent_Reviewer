11. Stock Repurchase Plan
In November 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $15
million in value of common stock in Open market purchases from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s management
depending on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The Company’s Board of Directors amended the program on
various dates, increasing the repurchase amount authorized and extending the expiration date. At December 31, 2016,
approximately $70 million of the Company’s share repurchase authorization was remaining for repurchases through December
31, 2017. All of the Company’s share repurchases were effected in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. This stock repurchase plan may be modiﬁed, suspended or terminated at any time by the Company
without notice.
Repurchases of common stock are recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. To the extent additional paid-in
capital had been reduced to zero through stock repurchases, retained earnings was then reduced. No shares were repurchased
during each of the three years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and the Company has $70.0 million available for future
repurchases.
12. Commitments and Contingencies

including the Department of Education, the Veterans Administration, and the Department of Defense. Management believes that
the potential effects of audit adjustments, if any, for the periods currently under audit will not have a material adverse effect,
individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
