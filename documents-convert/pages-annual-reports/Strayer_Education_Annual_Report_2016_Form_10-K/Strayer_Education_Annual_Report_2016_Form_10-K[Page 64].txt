STRAYER EDUCATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As part of commencing operations in Pennsylvania in 2003, the Company was required to maintain a “minimum protective
endowment” of at least $0.5 million in an interest—bearing account. These funds are required as long as the Company operates its
campuses in the state. The Company holds these funds in an interest-bearing account which is included in other assets.
Tuition Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company records tuition receivable and deferred revenue for its students upon the start of the academic term or
program. Therefore, at the end of the quarter (and academic term), tuition receivable represents amounts due from students for
educational services already provided and deferred revenue generally represents advance payments from students for academic
services to be provided in the future. Tuition receivables are not collateralized; however, credit risk is minimized as a result of the
diverse nature of the University’s student base. An allowance for doubtful accounts is established primarily based upon historical
collection rates by age of receivable, net of estimated recoveries. These collection rates incorporate historical performance based
on a student’s current enrollment status and likelihood of future enrollment. The Company periodically assesses its methodologies
for estimating bad debts in consideration of actual experience.
The Company’s tuition receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows as of December 31, 2015 and 2016
(in thousands):

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. In accordance with the Property,
Plant and Equipment Topic, ASC 360, the carrying values of the Company’s assets are re-evaluated when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If it is determined that an impairment loss has
occurred based on expected undiscounted future cash ﬂows, then a loss is recognized using a fair value-based model. Through
2016, no such impairment loss had occurred. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization expense was $20.6
million, $18.1 million and $17.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.
Construction in progress includes costs of computer software developed for internal use, which is accounted for in
accordance with the Internal-Use Software Topic, ASC 350-40. Computer software development costs that are incurred in the
