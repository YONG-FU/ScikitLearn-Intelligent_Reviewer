arrangements for the tu1t10n for each course at the t1me of enrollment. Tu1t1on revenue lS recognized ratably over the course of
instruction. If a student withdraws from a course prior to completion, a portion of the tuition is refunded, depending on when the
withdrawal occurs. Tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds, withdrawals, corporate discounts, employee tuition discounts and
scholarships. The University also derives revenue from other sources such as textbook-related income, certificate revenue, certain
academic fees, licensing revenue, and other income, which are all recognized when earned.
Tuition receivable and deferred revenue for our students are recorded upon the start of the course, which for the University is
the start of the academic term. Because the University’s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters, at the end of the
fiscal quarter (and academic term), tuition receivable represents amounts due from students for
