undergraduate students increased 4% in 2016, driven by an increase in enrollment of 7% and a 2% decline in revenue per student,
resulting primarily from the new pricing structure for new undergraduate students. For graduate students, revenues decreased 4%
in 2016, driven by a 6% decline in enrollment, offset by a 2% increase in revenue per student. The increase in graduate revenue
per student was due primarily to a tuition increase that commenced for the winter term 2016, and increased classes per student
compared to 2015.
Instruction and educational support expenses. Instruction and educational support expenses increased $6.9 million, or 3%, to
$241.0 million in 2016 from $234.1 million in 2015. We recorded $3.2 million and $0.4 million in adjustments in 2016 and 2015,
respectively, resulting from the NYCDA acquisition and changes in the timing and expected income from settlements and
executed sublease agreements signed during the period. We may record additional adjustments in the future. Instruction and
educational support expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 54.6% for 2016 from 53.9% in 2015.
Marketing expenses. Marketing expenses increased $8.9 million, or 13%, to $79.0 million in 2016 from $70.1 million in
2015. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 17.9% in 2016 from 16.1% in 2015.
Admissions advisory expenses . Admissions advisory expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 9%, to $17.8 million in 2016
from $16.3 million in 2015, primarily as a result of higher personnel costs. Admissions advisory expenses as a percentage of
revenues increased to 4.1% for 2016 from 3.8% in 2015.
General and administration expenses. General and administration expenses increased $1.4 million, or 3%, to $45.7 million
in 2016 from $44.3 million in 2015. General and administration expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.4% for 2016
from 10.2% in 2015.
Income from operations. Income from operations decreased $12.2 million, or 18%, to $57.5 million in 2016 from $69.7
million in 2015.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased to $0.6 million in 2016 from $3.9 million in 2015 following the repayment in
July 2015 of all our outstanding debt in connection with our amended credit facility. We have $150.0 million available under our
revolving credit facility and no balance outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
Provision for income taxes. Income tax expense decreased $3.6 million, or 14%, to $22.5 million in 2016 from $26.1 million
in 2015, primarily due to the decrease in income before income taxes attributable to the factors discussed above. Our effective tax
rate was 39.3% for 2016 and 39.5% for 2015. We expect our tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 39.5%, exclusive of one-time
tax adjustments associated with the vesting of equity awards.
Net income. Net income decreased $5.2 million to $34.8 million in 2016 from $40.0 million in 2015 due to the factors
discussed above.
Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared To Year Ended December 31, 2014
Enrollment. Average total enrollment increased to 40,450 students for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 40,254
students for the same period in 2014.
Revenues. Revenues decreased 3% to $434.4 million in 2015 from $446.0 million in 2014, principally due to a decline in
revenue per student of 3%. The decline in revenue per student is largely attributable to a new pricing structure which was
implemented for the first quarter of 20 14 which reduced tuition for new undergraduate students by approximately 20%, and gave
eligible students access to our Graduation Fund. Revenues for undergraduate students were generally unchanged in 2015, driven
by an increase in enrollment of 6% and a decline of 6% in revenue per student, resulting mostly from the new pricing structure for
new undergraduate students. For graduate students, revenues decreased 7% in 2015, driven by an increase in revenue per student
of 3%, offset by a decline in enrollment of 10%. The increase in graduate revenue per student was due primarily to increased
tuition and classes per student compared to 2014.
