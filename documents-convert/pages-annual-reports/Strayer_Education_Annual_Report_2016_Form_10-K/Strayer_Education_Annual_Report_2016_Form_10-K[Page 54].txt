Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $129.2 million compared to $106.9 million at December 31,
2015. At December 31, 2016, most of our cash was invested in bank overnight deposits.
On July 2, 2015, we used approximately $116 million of our existing cash and cash equivalents to prepay our term loan and
terminate an interest rate swap as part of an amendment to our credit and term loan agreement. We also paid approximately $0.9
million in transaction fees in connection with the amendment. The amended credit agreement provides for a $150 million
revolving credit facility and an option to establish incremental term loans under certain conditions. The amended credit agreement
has a maturity date of July 2, 2020. We had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of December 31,
20 1 6.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR or a base rate, plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to
2.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. An unused commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.35%, depending on our leverage
ratio, accrues on unused amounts under the revolving credit facility. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we
paid cash interest of $2.4 million and $ 0.3 million, respectively.
The amended credit agreement is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the personal property
and assets of the Company and the guarantors. The amended credit agreement contains customary covenants, representations,
warranties, events of default and remedies upon default. In addition, we must satisfy certain financial maintenance covenants,
including a total leverage ratio, a coverage ratio and a US. Department of Education Ô¨Ånancial responsibility composite score. We
were in compliance with all applicable covenants related to the amended credit agreement as of December 31, 2016.
Our net cash from operating activities decreased in 2016 to $44.5 million, as compared to $77.5 million for the same period
in 2015. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was largely the result of the change in income from operations from
$69.7 million in 2015 to $57.5 million in 2016, an increase of $3.1 million in the amount of cash paid for income taxes, and other
net reductions in working capital in 2016, including $4.6 million in payments related to compensation arrangements entered into
with the sellers of NYCDA (see below). Capital expenditures were $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016,
compared to $12.7 million for the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures for the year ending December 31, 2017 are expected
to be in the range of 3-3.5% of revenue.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock and, at December 31, 2016, had
$70 million in repurchase authorization to use through December 31, 2017. We did not pay a regular quarterly dividend in either
2015 or 2016, but declared a regular cash dividend of $0.25 per share per quarter to our common shareholders starting in the first
quarter of 20 17.
In 2016, bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was 3.7% compared to 3.0% for 2015.
