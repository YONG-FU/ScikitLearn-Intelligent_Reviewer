7. Long Term Debt
On July 2, 2015, the Company entered into an amended credit facility (the “Amended Credit Facility”) which provides for a
revolving line of credit (the “Revolver”) up to $150 million and provides the Company with an option, under certain conditions,
to increase the commitments under the Revolver or establish one or more incremental term loans in an amount up to $50 million
in the aggregate in the future. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Facility is July 2, 2020. The Amended Credit Facility
replaced the Company’s prior credit agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”), dated November 8, 2012, which had provided for
both a term loan and revolving line of credit and an original maturity date of December 31, 2016. All amounts outstanding under
the Prior Credit Agreement were repaid upon execution of the Amended Credit Facility. The Company paid approximately $0.9
million in debt financing costs associated with the Amended Credit Facility.
Borrowings under the Revolver will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company’s election, LIBOR or a base
rate, plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% depending on the Company’s leverage ratio. The Company also is subject to a
quarterly unused commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum depending on the Company’s leverage ratio, times the
daily unused amount under the Revolver.
All other remaining terms of the Prior Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect. The Amended Credit Facility is
guaranteed by the University and is secured by substantially all of the personal property and assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, representations, warranties,
events of default and remedies upon default, including acceleration and rights to foreclose on the collateral securing the Amended
Credit Facility. In addition, as with the Prior Credit Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy
certain financial maintenance covenants, including:
o A leverage ratio of not greater than 2 to 1. Leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to trailing four-quarter
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and noncash charges such as stock-based
compensation).
o A coverage ratio of not less than 1.75 to 1. Coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of trailing four-quarter EBITDA and
rent expense to trailing four-quarter interest and rent expense.
0 A Department of Education Financial Responsibility Composite Score of not less than 1.5.
