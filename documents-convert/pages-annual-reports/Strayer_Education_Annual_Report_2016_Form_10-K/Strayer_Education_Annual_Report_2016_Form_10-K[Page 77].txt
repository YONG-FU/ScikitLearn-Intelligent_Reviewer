Deferred Payments Related to Acquisitions
In the first quarter of 2016, the Company acquired NYCDA and entered into deferred payment arrangements with the sellers
in connection with this transaction. In April and August 2016, NYCDA achieved certain performance targets and the Company
subsequently paid $6.0 million and $0.5 million of deferred payments to the sellers, respectively. The remaining deferred
payment arrangements of up to $11.5 million are valued at approximately $7.5 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 3 for
further information on the NYCDA deferred payments.
In 2011, the Company acquired certain assets associated with the Jack Welch Management Institute, and entered into
deferred payment arrangements with the sellers in connection with that acquisition. The deferred payment arrangements are
valued at approximately $3.3 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition, one of the
sellers contributed $2.8 million to the Company representing the seller’s continuing interest in the assets acquired.
Deferred Revenue
The Company provides for certain scholarship and awards programs, such as the Graduation Fund (see Note 2 for additional
information), that are earned by students when they successfully complete course requirements. The Company also has licensed
certain of its noncredit bearing course content to a third party. Included in long-term deferred revenue is the amount of revenue
under these arrangements that the Company expects will be realized after one year.
Loss on Facilities Not in Use and Deferred Rent and Other Facility Costs
The Company records a liability for lease costs of campuses and non-campus facilities that are not currently in use (see Note
4). For facilities still in use, the Company records rent expense on a straight-line basis over the initial term of a lease. The
difference between the rent payment and the straight-line rent expense is recorded as a liability.
Lease Incentives
In conjunction with the opening of new campuses or renovating existing ones, the Company, in some instances, was
reimbursed by the lessors for improvements made to the leased properties. In accordance with ASC 840-20, the underlying assets
were capitalized as leasehold improvements and a liability was established for the reimbursements. The leasehold improvements
and the liability are amortized on a straight-line basis over the corresponding lease terms, which generally range from five to ten
years.
