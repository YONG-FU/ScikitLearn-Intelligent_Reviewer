In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of NYCDA, which provides non-degree courses in web and application
software development, primarily at its campus in New York City. We paid $7.0 million up front and another $6.5 million in 2016
once the sellers achieved two regulatory approval requirements. We may pay up to an additional $11.5 million to the sellers based
on the achievement of certain performance objectives, including NYCDA’s future revenue and operating results at the end of five
years. The acquisition was funded through our existing cash and cash equivalents.
We have available $150 million under our revolving credit facility. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash
generated from operating activities, and if necessary, cash borrowed under the credit facility, will be sufﬁcient to meet our
requirements for at least the next 12 months. Currently, we maintain our cash in mostly FDIC-insured bank accounts. Excess cash
is invested in money market funds, which is included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We
earned interest income of $0.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and
2016, respectively.

Impact of Inﬂation
Inﬂation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of the Securities
Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Ris k
We are subject to the impact of interest rate changes and may be subject to changes in the market values of our future
investments. We invest our excess cash in bank overnight deposits, money market funds and marketable securities. We have not
used derivative ﬁnancial instruments in our investment portfolio. Earnings from investments in bank overnight deposits, money
market mutual funds, and marketable securities may be adversely affected in the future should interest rates decline, although
such a decline may reduce the interest rate payable on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our future investment
income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell
securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, a 1% increase or decrease
in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values, or cash ﬂows related to investments in cash
equivalents or interest earning marketable securities.
Changing interest rates could also have a negative impact on the amount of interest expense we incur. On July 2, 2015, we
used approximately $116 million of our existing cash and cash equivalents to prepay our term loan and terminate an interest rate
swap as part of an amendment to our credit and term loan agreement. The amended credit agreement provides for a $150 million
revolving credit facility and an option to establish incremental term loans under certain conditions. The amended credit agreement
has a maturity date of July 2, 2020. We had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility after prepayment of the
term loan facility, and as of December 31, 2016. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR or a base
rate, plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. An unused commitment fee ranging from
0.25% to 0.35%, depending on our leverage ratio, accrues on unused amounts under the revolving credit facility. An increase in
LIBOR would affect interest expense on any outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility. For every 100 basis points
increase in LIBOR, we would incur an incremental $1.5 million in interest expense per year assuming the entire $150 million
revolving credit facility were utilized.
