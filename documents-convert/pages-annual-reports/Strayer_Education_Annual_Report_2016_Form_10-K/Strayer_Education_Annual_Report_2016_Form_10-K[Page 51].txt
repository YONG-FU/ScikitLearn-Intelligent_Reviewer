Since 2013, we have introduced a number of initiatives in response to the variability in our enrollment. Recognizing that
affordability is an important factor in a prospective student’s decision to seek a college degree, we reduced Strayer University
undergraduate tuition for new students by 20% beginning in our 2014 winter academic term. We also introduced the Graduation
Fund in mid-2013, whereby qualifying students can receive one free course for every three courses successfully completed. The
free courses are redeemable in the student’s final academic year. In 2015, we launched Strayer@Work, which works with Fortune
1000 companies to structure customized education and training programs for their employees, often with significant discounts to
our published tuition rates. These initiatives had a negative impact on Strayer University revenue per student, which declined 1%
in 2016, and is expected to decrease slightly in 2017, by approximately 1%.
As a result of these and other initiatives, average total enrollment grew approximately 3% in 2016. Should the 2016 full-year
enrollment growth continue in 2017, we would expect revenue for the full year 2017 to increase at a rate slightly less than
enrollment growth and operating expenses in 2017 to increase slightly.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared To Year Ended December 31, 2015
Enrollment. Average total enrollment increased to 41,556 students for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 40,450
students for the same period in 2015.
Revenues. Revenues increased 2% to $441.1 million in 2016 from $434.4 million in 2015, principally due to the increase in
enrollment offset by a decline in revenue per student of 1%. The decline in revenue per student is largely attributable to a new
pricing structure which was implemented for the first quarter of 20 14 which reduced tuition for new undergraduate students by
approximately 20%, and gave eligible students access to the Graduation Fund. Revenues for
