Our business is seasonal and as a result, our quarterly results of operations tend to vary within the year due to student
enrollment patterns. Enrollment generally is lowest in the third quarter, or summer term.
Student Admissions
Students attending Strayer University’s undergraduate programs must possess a high school diploma or a General
Educational Development (GED) Certificate. Students attending Strayer University’s graduate programs must have a bachelor’s
degree from an accredited institution and meet certain other requirements. If a student’s undergraduate major varies widely from
the student’s proposed graduate course of study, certain undergraduate prerequisite courses may also be necessary for admission.
To maximize undergraduate students’ chances for academic success and to ensure they receive the support they need, Strayer
University evaluates incoming students’ proﬁciency in fundamental English and math prior to the ﬁrst quarter’s registration.
International students applying for admission must meet the same admission requirements as other students. Those students
whose native language is not English must provide evidence that they are able to use the English language with sufficient facility
to perform college-level work in an English-speaking institution.
Tuition and Fees
Strayer University charges tuition by the course. Tuition rates may vary in states with speciﬁc regulations governing tuition
costs. Each course is 4.5 credit hours. As of January 1, 2017, undergraduate students who enrolled in the University on or after
November 7, 2016 are charged $1,435 per course. Undergraduate students who initially enrolled at Strayer prior to November 7,
2016 are charged rates ranging from $1,420 to $1,775 per course. As of January 1, 2017, graduate students who were new to the
University after January 1, 2015, are charged at a rate of $2,450 per course, while other graduate students are charged at a rate of
$2,325 per course. For the Jack Welch Management Institute, students who are new to the University on or after November 7,
2016, are charged at the rate of $3,450 per course. For students who first enrolled in the Jack Welch Management Institute prior
to November 7, 2016, tuition is charged at rates ranging from $2,580 to $3,250 per course. Under a variety of different programs
and in connection with various corporate and government sponsorship and tuition reimbursement arrangements, Strayer
University offers scholarships and tuition discounts to students. One of these programs, the Graduation Fund, offers a student in a
bachelor’s program an opportunity to earn up to a 25% reduction of the tuition required for a degree. A new undergraduate
student seeking to obtain a bachelor’s degree in four years and who was eligible for our Graduation Fund would currently pay on
average approximately $1 1,000 per year in tuition.
