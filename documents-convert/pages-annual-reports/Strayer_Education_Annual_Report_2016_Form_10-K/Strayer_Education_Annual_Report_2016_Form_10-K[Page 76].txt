Valuation and Expense Information under Stock Compensation Topic ASC 718
At December 31, 2016, total stock-based compensation cost which has not yet been recognized was $20.9 million for
unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock option awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over the next 26
months on a weighted-average basis. Awards of approximately 550,000 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units are
subject to performance conditions. The accrual for stock-based compensation for performance awards is based on the Company’s
estimates that such performance criteria are probable of being achieved over the respective vesting periods. Such a determination
involves signiﬁcant judgment surrounding the Company’s ability to maintain regulatory compliance. If the performance targets
are not reached during the respective vesting period, or it is determined it is more likely than not that the performance criteria will
not be achieved, related compensation expense is adjusted.
The following table sets forth the amount of stock-based compensation expense recorded in each of the expense line items
for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 (in thousands):
