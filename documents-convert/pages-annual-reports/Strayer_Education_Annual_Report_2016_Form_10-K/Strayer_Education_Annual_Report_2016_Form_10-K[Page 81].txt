16. Regulation
Gainful Employment
Under the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution offering programs of study other than a baccalaureate degree in
liberal arts (for which there is a limited statutory exception) must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized
occupation. On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations related to gainful employment. The
regulation went into effect on July 1, 2015, with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which were scheduled to go into
effect January 1, 2017, but have been delayed until April 3, 2017.
The new regulations include two debt-to-earnings measures, consisting of an annual income rate and a discretionary income
rate. The annual income rate measures student debt in relation to earnings, and the discretionary income rate measures student
debt in relation to discretionary income. A program passes if the program’s graduates:
0 have an annual income rate that does not exceed 8%; 9;:
0 have a discretionary income rate that does not exceed 20%.
In addition, a program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings metrics, and that has an annual income rate between
8% and 12%, or a discretionary income rate between 20% and 30%, is considered to be in a warning zone. A program fails if the
program’s graduates have an annual income rate of 12% or greater and a discretionary income rate of 30% or greater. A program
would become Title IV-ineligible for three years if it fails both metrics for two out of three consecutive years, or fails to pass at
least one metric for four consecutive award years. The regulations provide a means by which an institution may challenge the
Department of Education’s calculation of any of the debt metrics prior to loss of Title IV eligibility. On January 8, 2017, Strayer
received its ﬁnal 2015 debt-to-earnings measures. None of Strayer’s programs failed the debt-to-earnings metrics. Two active
programs, the Associate in Arts in Accounting and Associate in Arts in Business Administration, are “in the zone,” which means
each program remains fully eligible unless (1) either program has a combination of zone and failing designations for four
consecutive years, in which case it would become Title IV-ineligible in the fifth year; or (2) either program fails the metrics for
two out of three consecutive years, in which case the program could become ineligible for the following award year.
