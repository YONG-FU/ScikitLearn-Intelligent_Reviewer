Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal 2016 and 2015 primarily due to the cash unfavorable effects of lower net income and the related
unfavorable currency rate ﬂuctuations on our net income in each ﬁscal year relative to the corresponding prior year period.
Cash ﬂows from investing activities: The changes in cash ﬂows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, the timing of our purchases,
maturities and sales of our investments in marketable debt securities and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our
growth.
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Net cash used for investing activities decreased in fiscal 2016 relative to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net
cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities) and a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash used for investing activities increased in ﬁscal 2015 relative to ﬁscal 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash
used for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and an increase in net cash used to purchase marketable securities (net of proceeds received from sales and maturities).
Cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities: The changes in cash ﬂows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt
instruments as well as stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: We used net cash for ﬁnancing activities of $9.9 billion during ﬁscal 2016 in comparison to net cash provided by
financing activities of $9.9 billion during fiscal 2015. Cash used in ﬁnancing activities during ﬁscal 2016 was primarily due to cash outﬂows of $10.4 billion for
fiscal 2016 common stock repurchases and $2.5 billion for ﬁscal 2016 dividend payments, partially offset by $1.8 billion of cash inﬂows from ﬁscal 2016 debt
issuances, net of repayments. Cash provided by financing activities of $9.9 billion during ﬁscal 2015 was primarily due to $18.3 billion of net cash inﬂows from
fiscal 2015 debt issuances, net of repayments, partially offset by $8.1 billion of cash used for ﬁscal 2015 common stock repurchases and $2.3 billion of cash used
for ﬁscal 2015 dividend payments.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 increased in comparison to net cash used by ﬁnancing activities in
fiscal 2014 primarily due to a net increase in borrowings in ﬁscal 2015 as well as lower stock repurchase activity during ﬁscal 2015. These favorable impacts to our
financing cash ﬂows during fiscal 2015 were partially offset by the repayment of $1.5 billion of borrowings pursuant to senior notes maturities during fiscal 2015
(no repayments during fiscal 2014).
Free cash ﬂow: To supplement our statements of cash ﬂows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash ﬂows on a trailing 4-quarter basis
to analyze cash ﬂows generated from our operations. We believe free cash ﬂow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our
competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash ﬂow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our
performance, or as an alternative to cash ﬂows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash ﬂow as follows:
