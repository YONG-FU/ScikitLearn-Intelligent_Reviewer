Use of Estimates
Our consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with US. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable
guidance issued by the US. Securities and Exchange Commission. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions.
We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these
estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
of the ﬁnancial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between
these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated ﬁnancial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a
particular transaction is speciﬁcally dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s
judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.
