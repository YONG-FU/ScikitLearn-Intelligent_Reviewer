Hardware Business
Our hardware business consists of our hardware products segment and hardware support segment.
Hardware Products: Hardware products revenues are primarily generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer server, storage,
networking, workstations and related devices and industry-specific hardware products. We market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force and
indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products include the cost of
hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party
manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and
obsolete. Operating expenses associated with our hardware products also include sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include
variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware products, and amortization of intangible assets.
