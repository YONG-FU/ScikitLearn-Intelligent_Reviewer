Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total services revenues were ﬂat in ﬁscal 2015 as
incremental revenues from acquired companies, including MICROS, and an increase in fiscal 2015 advanced customer services revenues were offset by declines in
our fiscal 2015 consulting and education revenues. In constant currency, revenues growth in the EMEA region was offset by revenue declines in the Americas and
Asia Paciﬁc regions during fiscal 2015.
Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total services expenses increased during ﬁscal 2015 due to higher employee related expenses
resulting from increased headcount from our acquisitions and were partially offset by lower variable compensation and lower external contractor costs.
In constant currency, total margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 due to the increase in total expenses for this business.
Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest
