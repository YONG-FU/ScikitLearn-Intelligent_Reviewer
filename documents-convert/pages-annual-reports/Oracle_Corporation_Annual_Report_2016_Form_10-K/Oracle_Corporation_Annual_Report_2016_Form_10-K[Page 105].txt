Included in foreign currency losses, net were foreign currency remeasurement losses of $7 million, $23 million and $213 million in ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively, related to our Venezuelan subsidiary due to the continued “highly inﬂationary” designation of the Venezuelan economy in accordance with ASC 830,
Foreign Currency Matters (ASC 830); certain currency exchange legislation in Venezuela that created certain foreign exchange mechanisms that based upon our
speciﬁc facts and circumstances, were the most appropriate for the reporting of our Venezuelan subsidiary’s Bolivar-based transactions and net monetary assets in
US Dollars; and the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary pursuant to such foreign exchange mechanisms with the
corresponding loss recorded to earnings as required by ASC 830.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes . Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The ﬁrst step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including
resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated
statements of operations.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided
under “Business Combinations” above.
