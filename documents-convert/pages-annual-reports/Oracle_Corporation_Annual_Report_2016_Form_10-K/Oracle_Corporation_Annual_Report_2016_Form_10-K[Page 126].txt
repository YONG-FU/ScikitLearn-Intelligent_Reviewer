Total cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $1.3 billion, $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion for fisca12016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
aggregate intrinsic value of vesting of restricted stock-based awards and options exercised was $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion for ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and

$396 million and $480 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the total tax benefits received, we classified excess tax benefits from stock-based
compensation of $124 million, $244 million and $250 million as cash ﬂows from financing activities rather than cash ﬂows from operating activities for fiscal
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair
market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2016, 54 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the
Purchase Plan. We issued 3 million shares under the Purchase Plan in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Deﬁned Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans
We offer various defined contribution plans for our US. and non-US. employees. Total deﬁned contribution plan expense was $387 million, $362 million and
$357 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The number of plan participants in our benefit plans has generally increased in recent years as we have
hired additional employees and assumed eligible employees from our acquisitions.
In the United States, regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can
generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g)
limit as defined by the US. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay
period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $153 million, $144 million and $134
million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
