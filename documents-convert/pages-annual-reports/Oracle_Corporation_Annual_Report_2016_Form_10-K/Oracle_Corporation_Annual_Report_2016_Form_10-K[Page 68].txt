Services Business
Our services business consists of consulting, advanced customer support services and education services. Consulting revenues are earned by providing services to
customers in business and IT strategy alignment, enterprise architecture planning and design, initial software implementation and integration, and ongoing software
enhancements and upgrades. Advanced customer support services are provided on-premise and remotely to our customers to enable increased performance and
higher availability of their Oracle products and services and also include certain other services. Education revenues are earned by providing instructor-led, live
virtual training, self-paced online training, private events and custom training in the use of our cloud, on-premise software and hardware offerings. The cost of
providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor
expenses.
