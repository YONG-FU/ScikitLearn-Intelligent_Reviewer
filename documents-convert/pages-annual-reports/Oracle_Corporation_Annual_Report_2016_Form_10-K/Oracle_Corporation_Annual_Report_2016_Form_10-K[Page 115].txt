The 2016 Credit Agreements and the 2013 Credit Agreement contain certain customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. If any of
the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived, any unpaid amounts owed under the agreement to which the default relates
may be declared immediately due and payable and the relevant agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with the covenants of the 2016 Credit

Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes
In April 2013, pursuant to our existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program which allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to
a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws, we entered into new dealer agreements with various banks
and a new Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA. (JP Morgan). Effective on December 22, 2014, Deutsche Bank Trust
Companies Americas became the Successor Issuing and Paying Agent replacing JP Morgan. Since that time, we have entered into new dealer agreements with
additional banks. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes. We intend to back-stop any commercial paper notes that
we may issue in the future with the 2013 Credit Agreement.
