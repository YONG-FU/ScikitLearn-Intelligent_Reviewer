NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT%(Continued)

We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation
until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $419
million as of May 31, 2016 and were each approximately $408 million as of May 31, 2015 and were presented in other assets and other non-current liabilities in the

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our
acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into
government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $95 million, $69
million and $64 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our
deﬁned benefit plans as of May 31, 2016 was $949 million and $587 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2015 was $1.0 billion and $599 million, respectively.
