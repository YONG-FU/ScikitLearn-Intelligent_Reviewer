(1) Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we recorded goodwill adjustments for the effects on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the period that such a change is identiﬁed,
provided that any such change is within the measurement period (up to one year from the date of the acquisition).
(2) During ﬁscal 2015, we recorded a $186 million goodwill impairment loss to our hardware products reporting unit. We considered several approaches to determine the fair value of our hardware products
reporting unit as of March 1, 2015 and concluded the most appropriate to be the income approach. The fair value of our hardware products reporting unit pursuant to the income approach was impacted by
lower forecasted operating results for this reporting unit, primarily caused by lower forecasted revenues and our continued investment in hardware products research and development activities. We compared
the implied fair value of goodwill in our hardware products reporting unit to its carrying value, which resulted in the $186 million goodwill impairment loss and represented the aggregate amount of goodwill
for our hardware products reporting unit. The aggregate hardware products reporting unit goodwill that was impaired in ﬁscal 2015 resulted from our acquisitions of Pillar Data Systems, Inc., Xsigo Systems,
Inc., GreenBytes, Inc. and MICROS Systems, Inc. Such impairment loss was recorded to acquisition related and other expenses in our ﬁscal 2015 consolidated statement of operations. We did not recognize
any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2016 or ﬁscal 2014.
(3) Represents goodwill allocated to our other operating segments.
