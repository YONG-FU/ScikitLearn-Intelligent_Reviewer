Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate ﬂuctuations of 5 percentage points, hardware support revenues
decreased in ﬁscal 2O 16 due to reductions in sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines for which we offer hardware support. This decrease was
partially offset by incremental revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 that were primarily related to our acquisition of MICROS. On a constant currency
basis, the decrease in total hardware support revenues was attributable to revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2016.
Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate ﬂuctuations of 4 percentage points, total hardware support expenses decreased in ﬁscal 2016 primarily due to
reductions in employee related and other expenses from reduced headcount and reduced external contractor costs as we integrated MICROS into our operations,
due to a decrease in bad debt expenses, and due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized during ﬁscal
2O 16.
In constant currency, total hardware support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in ﬁscal 2O 16 due to the total expense reductions for
this segment.
Fiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014: Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate ﬂuctuations, hardware support revenues increased in ﬁscal 2015
primarily due to incremental revenues from acquired companies, primarily MICROS. The Americas region contributed 42%, the EMEA region contributed 52%
and the Asia Paciﬁc region contributed 6% to the increase in hardware support revenues during ﬁscal 2015.
In constant currency, total hardware support expenses decreased in ﬁscal 2015 primarily due to reduced service delivery costs due to operational initiatives and a
decrease in amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by higher employee related expenses resulting from increased headcount from our acquisitions, higher
external contractor expenses and higher bad debt expenses.
In constant currency, total hardware support margin and margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in ﬁscal 2015 due to the increase in total revenues and
decrease in total expenses for this operating segment.
