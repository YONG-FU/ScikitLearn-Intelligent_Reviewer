(1) Our results of operations for ﬁscal 2016 compared to ﬁscal 2015, and ﬁscal 2015 compared to ﬁscal 2014, were significantly impacted by movements in international currencies relative to the US. Dollar,
which decreased our ﬁscal 2016 and 2015 total revenues by 5 and 4 percentage points, respectively, total operating expenses by 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively, and total operating income by 7 and 6
percentage points, respectively, in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods.
(2) Total working capital and total assets sequentially increased in nearly all periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income generated during all
periods presented and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in ﬁscal 2015, €2.0 billion and $3.0 billion in ﬁscal 2014 and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013. Our total assets were also favorably
impacted by the issuance of $3.8 billion of short term borrowings in ﬁscal 2016. These increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, dividend payments and
capital expenditures made in all periods presented and the repayments of certain of our senior notes in ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2013.
(3) Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable, current and other current borrowings, and notes payable and other non-current borrowings as reported per our
consolidated balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased between ﬁscal 2012 and ﬁscal 2016 due to the issuances of $3.8 billion of short-term borrowings made pursuant to our revolving
credit agreements in fiscal 2016, and the issuances of long-term senior notes of $20.0 billion in ﬁscal 2015, 62.0 billion and $3.0 billion in ﬁscal 2014, and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2013. See Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.
