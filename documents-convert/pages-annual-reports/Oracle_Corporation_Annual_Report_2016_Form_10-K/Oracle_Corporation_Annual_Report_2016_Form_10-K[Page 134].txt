17. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan using the treasury
stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
