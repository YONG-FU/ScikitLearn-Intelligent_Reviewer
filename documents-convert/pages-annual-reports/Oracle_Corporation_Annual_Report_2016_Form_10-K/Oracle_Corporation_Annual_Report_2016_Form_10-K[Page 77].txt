We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufﬁcient to meet our working capital,
capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund any future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases
of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or
from the issuance of additional securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
investors.
Selected Quarterly Financial Data
Quarterly revenues, expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of sales force incentive
compensation plans. In addition, our European operations generally provide lower revenues in our first ﬁscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in
Europe during the summer. These seasonal factors are common in the technology industry. These factors have caused a decrease in our ﬁrst quarter revenues as
compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter, which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular ﬁscal year. Similarly,
the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues (in particular, our cloud software and on-premise software
segment) as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. We expect these trends to continue in ﬁscal 2017.
The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted
only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from annual
data due to rounding.
