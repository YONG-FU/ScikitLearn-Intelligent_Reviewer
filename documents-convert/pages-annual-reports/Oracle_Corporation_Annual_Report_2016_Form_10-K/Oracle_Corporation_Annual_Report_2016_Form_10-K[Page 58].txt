Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Our results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared to ﬁscal 2015 were significantly impacted by movements in
international currencies relative to the US. Dollar, which decreased our total revenues by 5 percentage points, total operating expenses by 4 percentage points and
total operating margin by 7 percentage points.
Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2016 due to constant currency growth in our cloud and on-
premise software business revenues and services business revenues. The constant currency growth in our cloud and on-premise software business revenues during
fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in our software license updates and product support revenues, growth in our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, and revenue
contributions from our recent acquisitions and was partially offset by fiscal 2016 decreases in our new software licenses revenues. The constant currency growth in
our services business revenues was primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions. These constant currency increases in our revenues during ﬁscal 2016 were
partially offset by constant currency decreases in our hardware business revenues. In constant currency, the EMEA region and the Asia Pacific region contributed
approximately equal amounts to our fiscal 2016 total revenues growth and the Americas was ﬂat.
Excluding the effects of favorable currency rate ﬂuctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2016 primarily due to increased sales and
marketing and research and development expenses resulting primarily from increased headcount, increased cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS expenses resulting from
increased headcount and infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud SaaS, PaaS and IaaS revenues, higher restructuring expenses that were
recorded pursuant to the Fiscal 2015 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2015 Restructuring Plan; see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Annual Report), and higher general and administrative expenses due to higher headcount and higher professional services fees, primarily legal
related fees. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by fiscal 2016 reductions in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets
that became fully amortized during fiscal 2016 and lower acquisition related and other expenses, which primarily was attributable to higher expenses during fiscal
2015 as a result of a goodwill impairment loss of $186 million (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report
for additional information).
