each annual reporting period is based on the actual attainment of performance targets. During our interim reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is
recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets are reﬂected in the
amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSU tranche on a cumulative basis during each interim reporting period in which such
estimates are altered and may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. For our service-
based awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally
four years.
We record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based
compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination, at the statutory
tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.
