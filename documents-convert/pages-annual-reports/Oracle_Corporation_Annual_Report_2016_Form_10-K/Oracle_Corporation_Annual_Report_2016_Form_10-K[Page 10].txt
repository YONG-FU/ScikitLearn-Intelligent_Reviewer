Oracle Cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Oracle Cloud Platform as a Service is designed to provide a broad suite of services to rapidly build and deploy applications—or extend Oracle Cloud SaaS
applications—using Oracle’s enterprise-grade platform technologies. Customers and partners can use our open, standards-based PaaS offerings that are based on
Java, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and our Oracle Database Cloud service, including tools for a variety of use cases across data management, application
development, enterprise integration, content sharing and collaboration, visual analysis reporting and IT operations management.
We believe our PaaS offerings are a large opportunity for us to expand our cloud and on-premise software business. We believe our customers increasingly
recognize the value of access to Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware and Java via a low cost, rapidly deployable, ﬂexible and interoperable services model
that Oracle manages and maintains on their behalf We believe that we can market and sell our PaaS offerings to our extensive installed base of database,
