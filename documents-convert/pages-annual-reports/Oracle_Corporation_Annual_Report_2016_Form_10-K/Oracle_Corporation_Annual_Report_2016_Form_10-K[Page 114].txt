ORACLE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT%(Continued)
May 31, 2016
(3) In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a ﬁxed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a ﬁxed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 11 for additional
information).
(4) We designated the July 2025 Notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain of our international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility in
stockholders’ equity caused by the changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro with respect to the US. Dollar (see Note 11 for additional information).
Senior Notes and Other Borrowings
In January 2016, our $2.0 billion of 5.25% senior notes due January 2016 matured and were repaid. In July 2014, our $1.5 billion of 3.75% senior notes due July
2014 (July 2014 Notes) matured and were repaid (we also settled the ﬁxed to variable interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2014 Notes).
Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually and the ﬂoating-rate senior notes for which
interest is payable quarterly. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of
an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances except for the ﬂoating-rate senior notes which may not be redeemed prior to their maturity.
The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our
commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the
subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance
with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2016.
Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May
31, 2016 were as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2017 $ 3,750 \
Fiscal 2018 6,000
Fiscal 2019 2,000 l
Fiscal 2020 4,500
Fiscal 2021 2,655 \
Thereafter 25,336

Revolving Credit Agreements
In May 2016, we entered into three revolving credit agreements with JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, as initial lender and administrative agent (the 2016 Credit
Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-term borrowings for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR—based formula or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as set
forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the termination date of the 2016 Credit Agreements.
In April 2013, we entered into a $3.0 billion Revolving Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, NA, Bank of America, NA, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, NA. and certain other lenders (the 2013 Credit Agreement). The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for an unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility to be used
for general corporate purposes including back-stOpping any commercial paper notes that we may issue. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2013 Credit
Agreement, we may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the 2013 Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the 2013 Credit Agreement. Interest
under the 2013 Credit Agreement is based on either (a) a LIBOR—based formula or (b) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the
