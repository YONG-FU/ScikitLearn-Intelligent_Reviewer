We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward
contracts. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions
that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency
forward contracts and other factors. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase US. Dollars in exchange for
other major international currencies were $2.7 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amounts of forward contracts we
held to sell US. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding
foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2016 and 2015. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income (expense),
net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $110 million, $157 million and $375 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Included in the net foreign exchange transaction losses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were foreign currency remeasurement losses relating to our Venezuelan
subsidiary’s operations of $7 million, $23 million and $213 million, respectively (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this Annual Report for additional information). As a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency
volatility in the future, the amounts and timing of which are unknown.
Foreign Currency Translation Risk—Impact 0n Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts
into US. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in US. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash
held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period
(the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and is also presented as a line item in our
consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report).
As the US. Dollar ﬂuctuated against certain international currencies as of the end of fiscal 2016, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
that we reported in US. Dollars for foreign subsidiaries that hold international currencies as of May 31, 2016 decreased relative to what we would have reported
using a constant currency rate as of May 31, 2015. As reported in our consolidated statements of cash ﬂows, the estimated effects of exchange rate changes on our
reported cash and cash equivalents balances in US. Dollars for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were decreases of $1 15 million, $1.2 billion and $158 million,
respectively. The following table includes estimates of the US. Dollar equivalent of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in certain major
foreign currencies that we held as of May 31, 2016:
US. Dollar
Equivalent at
(in millions) myﬂ, 2016
Euro s 2,4301
Japanese Yen 618
ﬁdian Rupee 493 1
Chinese Renminbi 442
Canadian Dollar 369 l
British Pound 262
:Swiss Franc 191 l
Australian Dollar 184
Other foreign currencies 1,806j
Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities denominated in foreign currencies $ 6,795
If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the US. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10%, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities we would report in US. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $680 million, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities balances.
