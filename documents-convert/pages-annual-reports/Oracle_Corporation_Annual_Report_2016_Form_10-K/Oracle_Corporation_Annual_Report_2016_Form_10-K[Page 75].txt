Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products, hardware products and services offerings
through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial
institutions within 90 days of the contracts” dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to ﬁnancial institutions as sales of
financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these ﬁnancing receivables. We ﬁnanced $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016, and $1.6
billion in each of ﬁscal 2015 and 2014, or approximately 16%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our new software licenses revenues in ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.
We financed $159 million, $172 million and $168 million of our hardware products revenues in ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 6% in
each of ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 of our hardware products revenues.

administrative agent (the 2016 Credit Agreements) and borrowed $3.8 billion pursuant to these agreements. The 2016 Credit Agreements provided us with short-
term borrowings for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Interest for the 2016 Credit Agreements is based on either (1) a LIBOR-based formula
or (2) the Base Rate formula, each as set forth in the 2016 Credit Agreements. The borrowings are due and payable on June 27, 2016, which is the termination date
of the 2016 Credit Agreements. Additional details regarding the 2016 Credit Agreements are included in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
