13. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 15, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors
approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $10.0 billion. As of May 31, 2016, approximately $8.8 billion remained available for
stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 271.9 million shares for $10.4 billion (including 2.3 million shares for $94 million
that were repurchased but not settled), 193.7 million shares for $8.1 billion and 280.4 million shares for $9.8 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively,
under the stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and
market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.60, $0.51 and $0.48 per share of our outstanding common stock,
respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In June 2016, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 27,
2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2016. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment
dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
