(1) The term “earnings” means the amounts resulting from the following: (a) our income before provision for income taxes, plus (b) the noncontrolling interests
in the net income of our majority owned subsidiaries, plus (c) our ﬁxed charges.
(2) The term “fixed charges” means the amounts resulting from the following: (a) our interest expensed, plus (b) our estimate of the interest component of rent
expense.
We do not report any shares of preferred stock outstanding in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements because our outstanding preferred stock is owned by one or
more of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our ratio of earnings to combined ﬁxed charges and preferred dividends for any given period is equivalent to our ratio of
earnings to ﬁxed charges.
