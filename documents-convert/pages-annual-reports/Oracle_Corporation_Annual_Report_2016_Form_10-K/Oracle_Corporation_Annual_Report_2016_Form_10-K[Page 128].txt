We provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless they are
considered indeﬁnitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2016, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other
outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes have not been provided was approximately $42.6
billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. If these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the United States, or if the other outside basis differences were recognized
in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise
taxable transaction. At May 31, 2016, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary
differences of undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $13.3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.
