Restructuring expenses in ﬁscal 2016 primarily related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2015 primarily related to our 2015
Restructuring Plan and our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Restructuring expenses in fiscal 2014 primarily related to our 2013 Restructuring Plan. Actions pursuant to the
aforementioned plans were substantially complete as of May 31, 2016. We may incur restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new
restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with legacy restructuring plans.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: Interest expense increased in ﬁscal 2016 primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $10.0
billion of senior notes in May 2015. We also issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in July 2014, which also contributed to additional interest expense during fiscal
2016 relative to fiscal 2015. These increases in interest expense during fiscal 2016 were partially offset by reductions in interest expense resulting from the maturity
and repayment of $2.0 billion of senior notes in January 2016. Interest expense was also reduced in ﬁscal 2016 by the maturity and repayment of $1.5 billion of
senior notes and the related fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements in July 2014. See Recent Financing Activities below and Note 8 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our borrowings.

Fiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015: On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net for ﬁscal 2016 increased due to higher interest income
resulting from higher interest rates and higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances and due to lower net foreign currency losses.

losses and due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment balances. Included in foreign currency losses, net in
fiscal 2015 and 2014 were remeasurement losses of $23 million and $213 million, respectively, related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Note 1 of Notes to
