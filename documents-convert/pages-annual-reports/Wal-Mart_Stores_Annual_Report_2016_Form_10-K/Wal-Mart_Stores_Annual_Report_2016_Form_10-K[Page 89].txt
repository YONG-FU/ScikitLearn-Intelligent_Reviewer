The Eligible Officer’s Deferred Compensation will be deferred proratably for each payroll period of the Plan Year. If
a payroll period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Deferred Compensation with
respect to such payroll period shall be determined by the Eligible Officer’s deferral election made with respect to the
Plan Year in which the payroll period ends. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with
Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive
Compensation.
(b) Compensation deferral elections must be filed:
(1) With respect to an individual who is an Eligible Officer as of the December 31 preceding the Plan Year for
which the deferral election is to be effective, no later than such December 31 ; or
(2) With respect to an individual who first becomes an Eligible Ofﬁcer during the Plan Year, within thirty (30)
days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Officer. For purposes of this rule, an Eligible
Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year only if:
(A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)—month period ending on the date
during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Officer; or
(B) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code
Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was
not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment.
A deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only with respect to Compensation for payroll
periods beginning after the payroll period in which the Eligible Officer’s election form (which may be
electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. In addition, a deferral election
under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only if the deferral election meets the requirements set forth in
Code Section 409A(a)(4)(B).
(c) The Deferred Compensation of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s
Compensation under this Section 3.1 with respect to a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral
Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In—Service Account in
accordance with Section 3.5.
