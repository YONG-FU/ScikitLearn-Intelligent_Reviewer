Ethics or requirements of applicable law (including regulations and other applicable guidance) regarding clawbacks

11.6 Death of Recipient. To the extent permitted in the Notice of Plan Award or under Committee rules and procedures, a
Recipient may name a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid, or who is authorized to
exercise the Recipient’s Plan Award, in the event of the death of the Recipient, subject to Committee rules and procedures. If no
such beneficiary is effectively named by the Recipient for any reason, then except to the extent otherwise provided in the Notice of
Plan Award or Committee rules and procedures, if the Recipient dies, the Recipient’s Plan Award may be paid to the Recipient’s
estate or may be exercised, in accordance with its terms or as allowed by law, by the Recipient’s estate or by the beneficiary or
person to whom the award devolves by bequest or inheritance. Unless otherwise provided in the Notice of Plan Award, (a) Plan
Awards may be exercised after death only to the extent the Recipient was otherwise entitled to exercise the Plan Award at the date of
the Recipient’s death and only if exercised within 12 months after the Recipient’s death, and (b) to the extent a Plan Award was
unvested at the date of death, the Plan Award shall terminate.

any other rights as a stockholder with respect to such Shares, notwithstanding the exercise (in the case of Options or Stock
