authorization for share repurchases as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program,
the current share repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. At
January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are
constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
