Other Risk Factors; No Duty to Update
We discuss certain of these factors more fully, as well as certain other risk factors that may affect the results and other matters discussed in the forward-looking
statements identified above, in our ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the
heading "Item 1A. Risk F actors." We filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, with the SEC on March 30, 2016. The
forward-looking statements described above are made based on knowledge of our business and our operating environment and assumptions we believed to be
reasonable when such forward-looking statements were made. As a consequence of the risks, factors and uncertainties we discuss above, and in the Annual Report
on Form 10-K and other reports we may file with the SEC, other risks not known to us at this time, changes in facts, assumptions not being realized or other
circumstances, our actual results may differ materially from those results discussed in or implied or contemplated by such forward-looking statements.
This cautionary statement qualifies all of the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report to Shareholders. We cannot assure you that the results, events
or developments expected or anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that those results, events or developments will result in the
expected consequences for us or affect us, our business or our operations in the way or to the extent we expect. You are urged to consider all of these risks, factors
and uncertainties carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report to Shareholders and not to place undue reliance on such
forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report speak only as of the date of this Annual Report to Shareholders, and
we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements to reﬂect subsequent events or circumstances, except to the extent required by
