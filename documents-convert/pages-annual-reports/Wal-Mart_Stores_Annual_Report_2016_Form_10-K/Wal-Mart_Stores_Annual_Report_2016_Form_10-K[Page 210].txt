The following table sets forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments, such as debt and lease

(1) "Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives classiﬁed as fair value hedges.
(2) "Capital lease and ﬁnancing obligations" includes executory costs and imputed interest related to capital lease and ﬁnancing obligations that are not yet recorded. Refer to Note 11 in the
"Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information.
Additionally, the Company has $15.0 billion in undrawn committed lines of credit which, if drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding at January 31, 2016 , and management's forecasted
market rates for our variable rate debt.
Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital
expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Purchase orders for inventory and other services are not included
in the table above. Purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for
the purchase of goods or services are deﬁned as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased; ﬁxed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Our purchase orders are based on
our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the
obligations under these contracts are not signiﬁcant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
The expected timing for payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid with
reSpect to some unrecorded contractual commitments may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts
for some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $607 million of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as
liabilities. The timing of the payment, if any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for
additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
In addition to the unrecorded contractual obligations presented above, we have entered into certain arrangements, as discussed below, for which the timing of
payment, if any, is unknown.
The Company has future lease commitments for land and buildings for approximately 215 future locations. These lease commitments have lease terms ranging
from 10 to 30 years and provide for certain minimum rentals. If leases for all of those future locations had been executed as of February 1, 2016, payments under
operating leases would increase by $34 million for fiscal 2017 , based on current estimates.
In connection with certain long-term debt issuances, we could be liable for early termination payments if certain unlikely events were to occur. At January 31, 2016
, the aggregate termination payment would have been $44 million . The arrangement pursuant to which this payment could be made will expire in fiscal 2019 .
