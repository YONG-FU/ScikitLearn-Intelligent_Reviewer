Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and ﬂuctuations in currency exchange
rates.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not
represent our view of future market changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality,
however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt issuances. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by
managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2016 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased
approximately $162 million primarily due to additional interest rate swaps acquired in fiscal 2016 and ﬂuctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table represents the
principal cash ﬂows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash ﬂows
and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to
be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates at January 31, 2016 .

As of January 31, 2016 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 19% of our total short-term
and long-term debt. Based on January 31, 2016 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by
approximately $79 million .
