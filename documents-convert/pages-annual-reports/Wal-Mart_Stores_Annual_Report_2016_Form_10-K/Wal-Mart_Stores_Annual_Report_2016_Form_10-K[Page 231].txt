Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. On October 13,
2015, the Board of Directors replaced the previous 8 1 5 .0 billion share repurchase program, which had approximately $8.6 billion of remaining authorization for
share repurchases as of that date, with a new $200 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new share
repurchase program has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make share repurchases. The share repurchases the
Company made during ﬁscal 2016 were made under both the old and new authorizations. At January 31, 2O 16 , authorization for $17.5 billion of share repurchases
remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.
The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,
cost of borrowings, its results of operations and the market price of its common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of
shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total cash paid for share repurchases for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
