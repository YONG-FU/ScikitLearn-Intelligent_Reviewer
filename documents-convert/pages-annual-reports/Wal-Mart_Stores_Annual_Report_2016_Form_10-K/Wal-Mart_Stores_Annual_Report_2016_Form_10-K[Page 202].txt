Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, decreased 0.7% for ﬁscal 2016 and increased 2.0% for
ﬁscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales decreased 0.7% for ﬁscal 2016 and increased 1.9% for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous
ﬁscal year. For fiscal 2016 , net sales were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion as a result of ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and a decrease of $1.9 billion
in fuel sales that resulted primarily from lower selling prices for fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales
was partially offset by the 1.3% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales
across the Company. For ﬁscal 2015 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to 3.0% year-over-year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in
the US. and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from ﬂuctuations in currency
exchange rates for ﬁscal 2015 .
Our gross proﬁt rate increased 29 basis points for ﬁscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. Improved margins in food, general merchandise, and consumables in
the Walmart U.S. segment positively impacted our gross profit rate. Changes in the merchandise mix in the Walmart International segment and a reduction in low
margin fuel sales in the Sam's Club segment also positively impacted our gross profit rate, while continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure at the Walmart U.S.
segment negatively impacted our gross profit rate. Our gross profit rate was relatively ﬂat in fiscal 2015 when compared to ﬁscal 2014.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 91 and 6 basis points for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous ﬁscal year.
For fiscal 2016 , the increase in Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. segment due
to the new associate wage structure and increased associate hours to improve the overall customer experience, the approximately $0.9 billion charge for the store
closures announced in January 2016 and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology. For f iscal 2015 , the increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to our continued investments in digital retail and higher health-care expenses in the US. from increased enrollment
in our associate health-care plans and medical cost inﬂation, the $249 million impact of wage and hour litigation in the US, as well as expenses of $148 million
related to the closure of approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan. The impact of these factors in the increase of operating expenses as a percentage of net
sales for ﬁscal 2015 was partially offset by nearly $1.0 billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014.
Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% , 32.2% and 32.9% for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Our effective tax rate ﬂuctuates from period to period
and may be impacted by a number of factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in laws, outcomes of
administrative audits, the impacts of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our US. and international operations. The reconciliation from the US. statutory
rate to the effective income tax rates for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is presented in Note 9 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."
As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $15.1 billion , $16.8 billion and $16.6 billion of consolidated income from continuing operations for ﬁscal
2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively; a decrease of $1.7 billion for ﬁscal 2016 and an increase of $263 million for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal
year. Diluted income from continuing operations per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $4.57 , $4.99 and $4.85 for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,
respectively.
