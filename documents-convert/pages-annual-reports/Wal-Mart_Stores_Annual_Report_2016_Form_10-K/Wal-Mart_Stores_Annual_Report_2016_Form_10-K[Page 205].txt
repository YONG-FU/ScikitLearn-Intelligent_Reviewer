Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased 2.1% for ﬁscal 2016 and increased 1.5% for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year. The ﬁscal 2016
decrease in net sales was primarily due to declines in comparable club sales, which were driven by a decrease of $1.9 billion in fuel sales that resulted primarily
from lower selling prices for fuel. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and higher e-commerce sales
at samsclubcom. The fiscal 2015 increase in net sales was primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 2.5%, driven by the addition of 15 new
clubs, partially offset by a decrease in fuel sales from lower fuel prices. Comparable club sales were ﬂat for fiscal 2015.
Gross profit rate increased 30 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 12 basis points for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016
, the increase was primarily due to the reduction in low margin fuel sales and lower merchandise acquisition costs, partially offset by the segments continued
investment in the Cash Rewards program. Fo r ﬁscal 2015 , the gross proﬁt rate decreased primarily due to the segments investment in the Cash Rewards program,
changes in merchandise mix, and commodity cost inﬂation, partially offset by an increased gross profit rate on fuel sales.
Membership and other incom e increased 5.3% and 7.7% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the
increase was primarily the result of increased membership upgrades and Plus Member renewals. For fiscal 2015 , the increase was primarily the result of increased
membership upgrades, Plus Member renewals and an increase in members from the opening of 15 new clubs.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 67 basis points for fiscal 2016 and decreased 16 basis points for ﬁscal 2015 , when compared to
the previous ﬁscal year. For ﬁscal 2016 , the increase in Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to lower fuel sales, an increase
in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure, our continued investments in new clubs, digital retail and information technology, and the approximately
$60 million charge for club closures announced in January 2016. For fiscal 2015 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was
primarily due to better expense management in a number of areas, including the optimization of the new in-club stafﬁng structure announced in fiscal 2014, which
resulted in decreases in wage expense and payroll taxes.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating inco me was $1.8 billion , $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion f or ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
