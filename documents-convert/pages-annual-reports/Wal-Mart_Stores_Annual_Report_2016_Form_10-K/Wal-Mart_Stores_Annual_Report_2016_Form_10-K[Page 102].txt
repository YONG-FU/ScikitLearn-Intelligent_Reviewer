Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then proratably from the remaining amount of the Participant’s
Scheduled In—Service Accounts and then proratably from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts.
(b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect
to any distribution under this Section 5.5 would not be permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m), such
payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction would not be permitted until the earliest date at which it
reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution would not be barred by application of Code Section
162(m); provided, however, that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date.
5.6 Distributions for Payment of Taxes.
Walmart’s Senior Vice President of Global Compensation, or any successor position, may accelerate and pay a portion of a
Participant’s Plan benefits in a lump sum equal to (a) the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed on Plan benefits and any
income tax withholding related to such amounts, as well as (b) any state, local or foreign taX obligations arising from participation in
the Plan (and related withholding under Code Section 3401) that apply to the amounts deferred under the Plan before such amount is
paid or made available to the Participant.

to reﬂect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per
annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the
