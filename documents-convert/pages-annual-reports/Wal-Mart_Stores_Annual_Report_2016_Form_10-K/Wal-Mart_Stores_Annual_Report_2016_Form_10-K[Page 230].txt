The Company's shareholder-approved Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan") became effective June 5, 2015 and amended and restated the Company's Stock
Incentive Plan of 2010. The Plan was established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance shares units and other equity compensation
awards for which 210 million shares of common stock issued or to be issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The
Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its shareholders.
The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
0 Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions
related to employment. Performance share units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0%
to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance
share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of
restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is
determined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is
recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units
in fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 7.4% , 7.1% and 6.7% , respectively.
0 Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from
the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of
grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.
The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used
to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was 8.7% , 9.5% and 10.3% , respectively.
In addition to the Plan, the Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The
stock option share-based compensation expense is included in the other line in the table above.
