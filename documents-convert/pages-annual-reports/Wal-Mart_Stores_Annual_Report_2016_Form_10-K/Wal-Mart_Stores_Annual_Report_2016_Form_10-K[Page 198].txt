by continued trafﬁc improvement and higher e-commerce sales at the Walmart U.S. segment, offset to a significant degree by the negative impact of lower fuel
sales primarily due to lower fuel prices at the Sam's Club segment. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.2% and 0.6% for
Walmart US. and Sam's Club, respectively, for fiscal 2016 . The fiscal 2015 total US. comparable store and club sales were positively impacted by higher trafﬁc
during the end of the fiscal year. E-commerce sales positively impacted comparable sales approximately 0.3% and 0.2% for Walmart US. and Sam's Club,
respectively, for ﬁscal 2015 .
As we continue to add new stores and clubs in the US, we do so with an understanding that additional stores and clubs may take sales away from existing units.
We estimate the negative impact on comparable store and club sales as a result of opening new stores and clubs was approximately 0.8% and 0.9% in
ﬁscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our estimate is calculated primarily by comparing the sales trends of the impacted stores and clubs, which are identiﬁed based
on their proximity to the new stores and clubs, to those of nearby non-impacted stores and clubs, in each case, as measured after the new stores and clubs are
opened.
Strategic Growth Investments
During fiscal 2016, we made capital investments globally of $1 1.5 billion . These capital investments primarily consisted of payments to add new stores and clubs,
remodel existing stores and clubs, construct distribution centers and invest in technology. In addition, we made an incremental operational investment of $296
million in e-commerce in ﬁscal 2016 as compared to ﬁscal 2015. We also made operational investments of approximately $1.2 billion in ﬁscal 2016 in connection
with the new associate wage structure and comprehensive associate training and educational programs announced in ﬁrst quarter of fiscal 2016. These operational
investments will continue into the year ending January 31, 2017 ("ﬁscal 2017").
