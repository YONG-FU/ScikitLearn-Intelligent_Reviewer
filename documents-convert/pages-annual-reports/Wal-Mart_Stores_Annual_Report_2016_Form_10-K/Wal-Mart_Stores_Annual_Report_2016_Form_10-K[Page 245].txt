Note 14. Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located in the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,
India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three business segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and
Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results its chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze
performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify
revenues for each of these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S. operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brands, as well as
walmartcom. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites. The Sam's Club
segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclubcom. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not
allocated to any of the Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate
overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations,
as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are
reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.
Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income from continuing operations before income
taxes, is provided in the following table:
