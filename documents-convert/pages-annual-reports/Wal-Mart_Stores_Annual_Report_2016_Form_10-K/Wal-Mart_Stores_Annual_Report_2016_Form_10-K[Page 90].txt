3.2 Deferred MIP Bonuses.
(a) For each Plan Year, each Eligible Participant may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s bonus (if
any) to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Participant under the MIP with respect to a performance period under the
MIP that coincides with the Plan Year or that ends within the Plan Year, provided, however, an Eligible Participant
who is not an Eligible Officer may elect to defer no more than eighty percent (80%) of the Eligible Participant’s MIP
bonus for a Plan Year. No election under this Section 3.2 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer
to an Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold
for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA
withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A. All bonus deferral
elections made under this Section 3.2 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms
(which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation.
(b) MIP bonus deferral elections must be filed:
(1) No later than the December 31 (or such other date as determined by the Committee or its delegate) preceding
the first day of the performance period for which the deferral election is to be effective.
(2) If authorized by the Committee or its delegate with respect to an Eligible Participant, and if the MIP bonus
constitutes “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A based on services
performed over a performance period of at least twelve (12) months, and if the Eligible Participant has been
continuously employed by an Employer or a Related Affiliate since the first day of the performance period,
then no later than the earlier of (i) the date that is siX months prior to the last day of the performance period, or
(ii) the date in the performance period as of which the amount of the MIP bonus has become both substantially
certain to be paid and calculable.
(3) Solely with respect to an Eligible Officer who first becomes an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year,
within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Participant, as described in Code
Section 409A(a)(4)(B). For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an
Eligible Participant during the Plan Year only if:
(A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to
be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)—month period ending on the date
during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Participant; or
