Liquidity and Capital Resources
Mquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities,
supplemented with our long-term debt and short—term borrowings, have been sufﬁcient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support
the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash ﬂow has been used to fund the dividends on our common stock and
share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, ﬁnance our global expansion activities, pay dividends and
fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2016 2015 2014
lNet cash provided by operating activities $ 27,389 $ 28,564 $ 23,257 ‘
Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.4 billion , $28.6 billion and $23.3 billion for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in net cash
provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations,
partially offset by improved working capital management. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous
ﬁscal year, was primarily due to the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as well as the timing of income tax payments.
In ﬁscal 2017, the Company will move forward with the second year of our new associate wage structure combined with comprehensive associate training and
educational programs which was announced in fiscal 2016. We anticipate cash ﬂows provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund these programs in
ﬁscal 2017 and future years.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Our working capital deﬁcit was $4.4 billion and $2.0
billion at January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The increase in our working capital deficit reﬂects the Company's efﬁcient leverage achieved through
improved working capital management, in addition to the timing of payments. We generally operate with a working capital deﬁcit due to our efﬁcient use of cash
in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and in providing returns to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share
repurchases.
We use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost
possible. We do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate earnings held outside of the US. and anticipate our domestic liquidity needs will be met through cash
ﬂows provided by operating activities, supplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Accordingly, we intend, with only certain exceptions, to
continue to indefinitely reinvest our earnings held outside of the US. in our foreign operations. When the income earned, either from operations or through
intercompany ﬁnancing arrangements, and indeﬁnitely reinvested outside of the US. is taxed at local country tax rates, which are generally lower than the US.
statutory rate, we realize an effective tax rate beneﬁt. If our intentions with reSpect to reinvestment were to change, most of the amounts held within our foreign
operations could be repatriated to the US, although any repatriation under current US. tax laws would be subject to US. federal income taxes, less applicable
foreign tax credits. We do not expect local laws, other limitations or potential taxes on anticipated future repatriations of earnings held outside of the US. to have a
material effect on our overall liquidity, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations.
As of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively, may not be freely
transferable to the US. due to local laws or other restrictions.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
As of January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2016 2015 2014
lNet cash used in investing activities $ (10,675) $ (11,125) $ (12,526) ‘
Net cash used in investing activities was $10.7 billion , $11.1 billion and $12.5 billion for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and generally consisted of
payments to add stores and clubs, remodel existing stores and clubs, expand our digital retail capabilities and invest in other technologies. For fiscal 2016 , we
Opened 423 new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $450 million and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when
compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to lower capital expenditures. The following table provides additional capital expenditure detail:
