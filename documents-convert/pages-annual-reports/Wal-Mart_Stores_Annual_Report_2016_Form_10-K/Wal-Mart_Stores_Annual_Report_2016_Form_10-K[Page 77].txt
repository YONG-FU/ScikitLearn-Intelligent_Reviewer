If Walmart or an Affiliate terminates a Recipient’s employment with Walmart or the Affiliate, the potential value of any Plan Award
that must be returned to Walmart will not be an element of any damages that the Recipient may have for any termination of
employment or other relationship in violation of any contractual or other rights the Recipient may have.
11.8 No Liability of Committee Members. Walmart shall indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Committee and each
other officer and director of Walmart or any Affiliate that has any duty or power relating to the administration of the Plan against
any liability, obligation, cost or expense incurred by that person arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan
or any Plan Award if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of
Walmart. Indemnification of Associates, directors, and agents shall be determined pursuant to the requirements of Article VI of
Walmart’s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
11.9 Adjustments upon Changes in Capitalization or Merger. Subject to any required action by the Walmart stockholders, the
number and type of Shares (or other securities or property) covered by each Plan Award, and the number and type of Shares (or
other securities or property) which have been authorized for delivery under the Plan but as to which no Plan Awards have yet been
granted or which have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation or expiration of a Plan Award, the price per Share covered by any
outstanding Plan Award that includes in its terms a price per Share, and the number of Shares with respect to which Plan Awards
may be granted to an individual shall be proportionately adjusted to reﬂect an extraordinary dividend or other distribution (whether
in the form of cash, Shares or other securities or property), stock split, reverse stock split, merger, reorganization, subdivision,
consolidation or reduction of capital, recapitalization, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or reclassification of the Shares,
or any other increase or decrease in the number of outstanding Shares effected without receipt of consideration by Walmart, issuance
or warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of Walmart or other similar corporate transaction or event that
affects the Shares such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. That adjustment shall be made by the
Committee, whose determination shall be final, binding and conclusive as to every person interested under the Plan. Except as
expressly provided herein, no issuance by Walmart of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of
any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to a
Plan Award.
11.10 Tax Withholding. Whenever taxes are to be withheld in connection with the grant, vesting, lapse of restrictions, exercise or
settlement of a Plan Award or for any other reason in connection with a Plan Award (the date on which such withholding obligation
arises being hereinafter referred to as the “Tax Date”), the Committee may decide, in its sole discretion, to provide for the payment
for the withholding of federal, state and local taxes (including Social Security and Medicare (“FICA”) taxes by one or a combination
of the following methods and may (but need not) permit the Recipient to elect the method or methods: (a) payment in cash of the
amount to be withheld, (b) requesting Walmart to withhold from Shares that would otherwise be delivered in settlement of a Plan
Award payable in Shares (or upon the lapse of Restrictions on a Plan Award) a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the
Tax Date or the last NYSE trading day prior to the Tax Date no greater than the amount to be withheld, (0) transfer of
