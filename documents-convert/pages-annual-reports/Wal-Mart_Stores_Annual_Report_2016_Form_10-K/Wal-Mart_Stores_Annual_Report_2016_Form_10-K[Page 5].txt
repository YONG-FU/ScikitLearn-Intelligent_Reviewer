The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a
franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our
founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in
Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our ﬁrst Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we opened our ﬁrst Neighborhood Market.
In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has continued to expand
and, as of January 31, 2016 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries.
In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website. Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow. As of January 31,
2016 , we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.
