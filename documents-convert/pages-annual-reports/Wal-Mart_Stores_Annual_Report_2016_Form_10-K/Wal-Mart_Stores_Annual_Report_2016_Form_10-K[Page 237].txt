investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 .
Cash Flow Instruments
The Company was a party to receive variable-rate, pay fixed-rate interest rate swaps that matured in July 2015 . The Company used these interest rate swaps to
hedge the interest rate risk of certain non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps were designated as cash ﬂow hedges of interest expense risk. Amounts reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to these derivatives were reclassiﬁed from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings as
interest was expensed for the Company's variable-rate debt, converting the variable-rate interest expense into fixed-rate interest expense.
The Company is also a party to receive fixed-rate, pay ﬁxed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted
payments of principal and interest of certain non-US. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash ﬂow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on
the non-US. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash ﬂow hedges of foreign exchange risk is
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the
assessment of effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash ﬂows. As a result, the amount
reclassiﬁed into earnings each period includes an amount that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to
earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the hedging instrument. These cash ﬂow instruments will mature on
dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 .
