Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. On October 13,
2015, the Board of Directors replaced the previous $15.0 billion share repurchase program, which had $8.6 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases
as of that date, with a new $20.0 billion share repurchase program. As was the case with the replaced share repurchase program, the new share repurchase program
has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which we can make share repurchases. At January 31, 2016 , authorization for $17.5 billion of
share repurchases remained under the current share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status. The
Company intends to utilize the current share repurchase authorization through the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things,
current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a significant
majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash ﬂows. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis,
the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions, excep_t per share data) 2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Total number of shares repurchased 62.4 13.4 89.1 ‘
Average price paid per share $ 65.90 $ 75.82 $ 74.99
lTotal amount paid for share repurchases $ 4,112 $ 1,015 $ 6,683 ‘
Share repurchases increased $3.1 billion for ﬁscal 2016 and decreased $5.7 billion for fiscal 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For
ﬁscal 2016 , the increase in share repurchases resulted from our intention to utilize the current share repurchase authorization over the next two years. For ﬁscal
2015 , the decrease was a result of cash needs, reduced leverage and increased cash used in transactions with noncontrolling interests described further below.
