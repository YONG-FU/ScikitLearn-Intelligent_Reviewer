ﬁscal 2016 , the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the $17.1 billion of negative impact from ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and negative
comparable sales in the UK. and China, partially offset by year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.2% and positive comparable sales in Mexico and
Canada. For ﬁscal 2015 , the decrease in net sales was primarily due to $5.3 billion of negative impact from ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates, partially offset

2O 16 and 2015 increases in gross profit rate were primarily due to changes in the merchandise mix in certain markets.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 basis points for fiscal 2016 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the approximately $150 million charge for the announced closure
of 115 underperforming stores in Brazil and other Latin American markets in January 20 16, increased employment claim contingencies and higher utility rates in
Brazil and continued investments in digital retail and information technology.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 51 basis points for fiscal 2015 when compared to the previous fiscal year due to the nearly $1.0
billion of aggregated expenses incurred in fiscal 2014 , including charges for contingencies in Brazil, store closure costs in China and Brazil, store lease expenses
in China and Mexico and expenses for the termination of the joint venture in India, partially offset by fiscal 2015 expenses of $148 million related to the closure of
approximately 30 underperforming stores in Japan.
