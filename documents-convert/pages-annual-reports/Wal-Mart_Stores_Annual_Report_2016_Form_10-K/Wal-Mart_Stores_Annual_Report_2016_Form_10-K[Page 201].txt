Free Cash Flow
Free cash ﬂow is considered a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash ﬂow, which measures our ability to generate additional
cash from our business operations, is an important ﬁnancial measure for use in evaluating the Company's ﬁnancial performance. Free cash ﬂow should be
considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated income from continuing operations as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by
Operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.
We define free cash ﬂow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We generated
free cash ﬂow of $15.9 billion , $16.4 billion and $10.1 billion for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The decrease in free cash ﬂow in fiscal 2016 from
ﬁscal 2015 was primarily due to lower income from continuing operations, partially offset by lower capital spending and improved working capital management.
Walmart's deﬁnition of free cash ﬂow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash ﬂows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the
measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we
believe it is important to view free cash ﬂow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Although other companies report their free cash ﬂow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash ﬂow. As a result, the method used by
Walmart's management to calculate our free cash ﬂow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash ﬂow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to
be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash ﬂow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used
in financing activities.
