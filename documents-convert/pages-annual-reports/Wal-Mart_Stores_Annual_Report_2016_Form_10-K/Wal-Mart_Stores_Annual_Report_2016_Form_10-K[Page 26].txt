We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas that serve as our principal ofﬁce and own and lease office facilities throughout the US. and internationally for
operations and field and market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors
to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales
volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of which include escalation clauses causing an increase in rents.
For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under "Item 1. Business."
