(2) The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan
equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Account determined in accordance with Section 5.3(b)(2)
(using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with interest
calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s death occurs.
(d) Death After Commencement of Installments. Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a Participant’s death
after installment payments to the Participant have commenced, such installment payments shall continue to be made
to the Participant’s designated beneficiary in the same manner as they were being distributed to the Participant prior
to his or her death, provided, however, that if the Participant’s distribution election applicable to Section 5.3(a) is a
lump sum payment, the Participant’s remaining installments will be distributed in lump sum to the Participant’s
designated beneficiary within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’s
death occurs.
(e) Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the
form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries (which may be a trust or trusts) to
receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant’s death, and may
designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. A Participant may change such
designation from time to time and the last designation filed with the Committee in accordance with its procedures
prior to the Participant’s death will control. In the event no beneficiary is designated, or if all designated beneficiaries
predecease the Participant, payment shall be payable to the following “default” beneficiaries of the Participant in the
following order of priority: (1) the Participant’s surviving spouse known to the Committee, if any, (2) the
Participant’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the Participant’s living parents known to the
Committee in equal shares; (4) the Participant’s surviving siblings known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the
beneficiary’s estate for distribution in accordance with the terms of the beneficiary’s last will and testament or as a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine.
(f) Death of Beneficiary. In the event a beneficiary dies before full payment of the Participant’s benefits under the Plan,
benefits that would have been paid to such beneficiary shall continue in the same form in equal shares to the
remaining beneficiaries at the same level (i.e., primary, contingent) and, if none, to the next level of beneficiaries. If
there are no beneficiaries at the next level, then any remaining benefits shall be paid to the following “default”
beneficiaries of the last living beneficiary in the following order of priority: (1) the beneficiary’s surviving spouse
known to the Committee, if any, (2) the beneficiary’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the
beneficiary’s surviving parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the beneficiary’s surviving
