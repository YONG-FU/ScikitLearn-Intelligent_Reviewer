Cash proceeds of $671 million received from the sale of the Vips restaurant business in Mexico ("Vips") on May 12, 2014, which is further described in Note 13 to
our Consolidated Financial Statements, also reduced net cash used in investing activities in ﬁscal 2015 .
We continued to focus on seamlessly integrating the digital and physical shopping experience for our customers and expanding in digital retail in each of our
segments during ﬁscal 2016 . Some of our ﬁscal 2016 accomplishments in this area were to successfully launch "Walmart Pay," grow integrated mobile
applications and services including "Online Grocery" and "Pickup Today," continue to roll out our new web platform in the U.S. and open new e-commerce
dedicated fulﬁllment centers.
Growth Activities
In ﬁscal 2017, we plan to add between 342 and 405 new stores and clubs, which will include a continued investment in Neighborhood Markets and a moderation of
Supercenter growth in the U.S. compared to recent fiscal years. In addition, we plan to continue the growth of our digital retail capabilities by investing
approximately $1.1 billion in e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications that will include technology, infrastructure and other elements of our e-
commerce operations to better serve our customers and support our stores and clubs. We anticipate ﬁnancing these growth activities through cash ﬂows provided
by operating activities and future debt ﬁnancings.
The following table provides our projected fiscal 2017 capital expenditures. Our anticipated digital retail expenditures are included in our projected ﬁscal 2017
capital expenditures. The amounts in the table do not include capital expenditures or growth in retail square feet from any pending or future acquisitions.

lNet cash used in ﬁnancing activities $ (16,122) $ (15,071) $ (10,789) ‘
Net cash flows used in financing activities generally consist of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, ﬁnancing obligations, dividends paid and
the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash ﬂows from financing activities. Net cash used
in financing activities increased $1.1 billion and $4.3 billion for fiscal 2016 and ﬁscal 2015 , respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal
year.
Short-term Borrowings
Net cash ﬂows provided by short-term borrowings increased $1.2 billion in ﬁscal 2016 and decreased $6.3 billion in ﬁscal 2015 , when compared to the balance at
the end of the previous ﬁscal year. We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments,
share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For ﬁscal 2016 , the increase in net cash ﬂows provided by short-term borrowings partially
offset a larger $2.0 billion decrease in long-term debt due within one year. For fiscal 2015 , more cash provided from operating activities combined with less cash
used for share repurchases and capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 allowed us to minimize our
