5.4 Form of Distribution.
(a) Forms Available. In the event of a Participant’s Separation from Service, or in the event of a Participant’s death if the
Participant dies prior to Separation from Service, distribution of his or her Retirement Account or, in the event of
death, his or her Account, may be made, at the Participant’s election per this Section 5 .4, in one of the following
forms:
(1) a lump sum;
(2) subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years; or
(3) solely with respect to distribution of the Participant’s Account in the event of death, partially a lump sum and,
subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period
not to exceed fifteen (15) years;
provided, however, that an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum
payment would be valued, the value of the Participant’s Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, Account, is at
least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Retirement Account, or in the event of death, Account,
is valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued
shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment.

respect to his or her Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, his or her Account, per this Section 5.4 at any time

electronic) approved by Executive Compensation and filed with Executive Compensation, provided, however, that
such subsequent election shall be subject to the following restrictions:
(1) A subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which such
subsequent election is made;
(2) Payment or initial payment pursuant to a subsequent election may not be made earlier than five (5) years from
the date such payment would have been made absent the subsequent election (but, for this purpose, installment
payments shall not commence until the first January 31 after such delay), unless the distribution is made on
account of the Participant’s death;
