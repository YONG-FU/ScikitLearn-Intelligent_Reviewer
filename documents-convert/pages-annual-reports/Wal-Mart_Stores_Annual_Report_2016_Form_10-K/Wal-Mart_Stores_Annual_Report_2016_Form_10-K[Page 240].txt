The Company had valuation allowances recorded of approximately $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated
primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2016 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future
realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2016 , decreases due to
operating loss expirations and ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax
assets will be fully realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more likely than not probability
that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $607 million and $838 million , respectively. The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $522 million and $763 million for January 31, 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively.
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations was as follows:
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) 2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Unrecognized tax beneﬁts, beginning of year $ 838 $ 763 $ 818 ‘
Increases related to prior year tax positions 164 7 41
’Decreases related to prior year tax positions (446) (17) (112) ‘
Increases related to current year tax positions 1 19 174 133
’Settlements during the period (25) (89) (117) ‘

’Unrecognized tax beneﬁts, end of year $ 607 $ 838 $ 763 l
The Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, general and administrative expenses,
respectively. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recognized interest and penalty expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions of $5 million ,
$18 million and $(7) million , respectively. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions of $60 million and $57 million ,
respectively, was recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any accrued penalties recorded for income taxes as of
January 31, 2016 or 2015.
During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by between $50 million and $150 million
, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving tax audits as
expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve
months. The Company does not expect any change to have a significant impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its US. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2013 through 2016 . The Company also remains
subject to income tax examinations for international income taxes for ﬁscal 2000 through 2016 , and for US. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal
years ended 2008 through 2016 .

Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reﬂected
in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an
accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into
discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company's
shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters, or groups of related matters, discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the
aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
Wage-and-Hour Class Action: The Company is a defendant in Braun/Hummel v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , a class-action lawsuit commenced in March 2002 in the
Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs allege that the Company failed to pay class members for all hours worked and prevented class
members from taking their full meal and rest breaks. On October 13, 2006 , a jury awarded back-pay damages to the plaintiffs of approximately $78 million on
their claims for off-the-clock work and missed rest breaks. The jury found in favor of the Company on the plaintiffs' meal-period claims.
