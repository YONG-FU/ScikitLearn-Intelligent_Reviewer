(a) In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee or its delegate, in its sole and absolute discretion and
upon written application of a Participant or, following the Participant’s death, the beneficiary to whom a Participant’s
benefits are then being paid, or will be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3, may direct immediate distribution of all or a
portion of the Participant’s Account (excluding the Participant’s Matching Account and related earnings if the
Participant is not fully vested in his or her Matching Account). The Committee will permit distribution on account of
an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, plus amounts
necessary to pay federal, state or local income taxes and penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the
distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or
compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant’s or beneficiary’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of
such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any
distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be made from the Participant’s Scheduled In—Service Accounts with
respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then from the
Participant’s Retirement Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan
