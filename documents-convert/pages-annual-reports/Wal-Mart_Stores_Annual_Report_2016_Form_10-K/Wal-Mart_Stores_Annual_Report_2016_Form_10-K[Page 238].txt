Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation
The Company's effective income tax rate is typically lower than the US. statutory tax rate primarily because of beneﬁts from lower-taxed global operations,
including the use of global funding structures and certain US. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of the Company's
significant accounting policies in Note 1. The Company's non-US. income is generally subject to local country tax rates that are below the 35% US. statutory tax
rate. Certain non-US. earnings have been indeﬁnitely reinvested outside the US. and are not subject to current US. income tax. A reconciliation of the significant
differences between the US. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations is as follows:
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
2016 2015 2014
’US. statutory tax rate 35.0 % — 35.0 % — 35.0 %‘
US. state income taxes, net of federal income tax beneﬁt 1.8 % 1.8 % 2.0 %
’Income taxed outside the US. (4.0)% (2.7)% (2.8)%‘
Net impact of repatriated international earnings 0.1 % (1.5)% (1.4)%
)Other, net (2.6)% (0.4)% 0.1 %\
Effective income tax rate 30.3 % — 32.2 % — 32.9 %
