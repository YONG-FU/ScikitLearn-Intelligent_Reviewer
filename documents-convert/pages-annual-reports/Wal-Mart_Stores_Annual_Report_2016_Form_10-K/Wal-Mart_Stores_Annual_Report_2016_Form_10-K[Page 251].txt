Report on Ethical Standards
Our Company was founded on the belief that open communications and the highest standards of ethics are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing "Open
Door" communication policy helps management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are
encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart.
Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance
with the law in the conduct of Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates who are part of
management. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers. Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction
Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit Committee. The
senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which
oversees and administers several reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to make conÔ¨Ådential and
anonymous complaints regarding potential violations of our statements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters.
