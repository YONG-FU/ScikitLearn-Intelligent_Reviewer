Unremitted Earnings
US. income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of the Company's international subsidiaries of approximately $26.1 billion
and $23.3 billion as of January 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these amounts outside of the US. However, if
any portion were to be distributed, the related US. tax liability may be reduced by foreign income taxes paid on those earnings. Determination of the unrecognized
deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities with its hypothetical calculation. The Company provides
deferred or current income taxes on earnings of international subsidiaries in the period that the Company determines it will remit those earnings.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwara's and Valuation Allowances
At January 31, 2016 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $5.3 billion . Of these carryforwards,
approximately $3.0 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2036 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. At January 31, 2016 , the
Company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.8 billion , which will expire in various years through 2026 , if not utilized.
The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including
taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the
extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, a valuation allowance is established. If a valuation allowance
has been established and management subsequently determines that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance is
released.
