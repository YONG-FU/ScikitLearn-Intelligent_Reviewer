Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased 3.6% and 3.1% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, when compared to the previous ﬁscal year. The increases
in net sales were primarily due to year-over-year growth in retail square feet of 1.4% and 3.2% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively, as well as increases in
comparable store sales of 1.0% and 0.6% for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Positive customer trafﬁc and higher e-commerce sales contributed to the increases
in comparable store sales in both periods.
The ﬁscal 2016 gross profit rate increased 12 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to improved margin in food, general merchandise,
and consumables, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. The fiscal 2015 gross profit rate decreased 12 basis points when compared to the
previous ﬁscal year, primarily due to the result of the segments strategic focus on price investment, pharmacy cost inﬂation, reductions in third-party
reimbursement rates and changes in merchandise mix.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 113 and 24 basis points for ﬁscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the previous
ﬁscal year. For fiscal 2016 , the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the new associate wage structure and increased associate
hours. Enhancements to the customer-facing areas of the store to improve the overall customer experience drove the increase in associate hours as well as increased
maintenance expenses. In addition, the approximately $700 million charge for the closures of 150 stores announced in January 2016, an increase in store associate
incentive expense and our continued investments in digital retail and information technology contributed to the ﬁscal 2016 increase in operating expenses as a
percentage of segment net sales. For fiscal 2015 , the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily driven by higher health-
care expenses from increased enrollment in our associate health-care plans and medical cost inﬂation. In addition, expenses from severe winter storms early in
ﬁscal 2015 contributed to the increase in Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income was $19.1 billion , $21.3 billion and $21.8 billion during ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ,
respectively.
