ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is
accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is
necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or
manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our
consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls
and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new,
more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing
monitoring controls. These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains
effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. Based upon that
evaluation, our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it ﬁles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as apprOpriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.
Reports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management's report on internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and the attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public
accounting firm, on the Company's internal control over financial reporting are incorporated herein by reference to all information under the captions
"Management's Report to Our Shareholders" and "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,"
respectively, included in our Annual Report to Shareholders. Such information is included in Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we identiﬁed and disclosed a material weakness in our controls over accounting for leases. The material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting resulted from a lack of controls which allowed for the misinterpretation and historical misapplication of Accounting
Standards Codiﬁcation 840, Leases ("ASC 840") regarding sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets.
Specifically, we did not have adequate controls in place to properly identify and account for leases that were subject to the sale-leaseback accounting guidance,
primarily leases in which we made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets, which should have resulted
in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. To remediate the material weakness described above, we designed and
implemented controls and enhanced and revised the design of existing controls and procedures to properly apply sale-leaseback accounting, primarily lessee
involvement in the construction of leased assets, under ASC 840.
During the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2016, we successfully completed the testing necessary to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated.
Except as noted above, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2016 , that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
