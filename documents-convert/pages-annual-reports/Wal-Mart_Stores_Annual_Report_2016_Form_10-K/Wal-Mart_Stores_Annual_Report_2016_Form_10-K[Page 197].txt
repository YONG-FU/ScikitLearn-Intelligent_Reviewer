Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our
business strategies to ensure we maintain our strong leadership position around the world and in the countries in which we operate. For several years, our
performance metrics emphasized three financial priorities: growth, leverage and returns. We are currently making strategic investments in our associates and in the
integration of digital and physical retail. These investments support long-term growth while we maintain our heritage of everyday low prices which are supported
by everyday low cost. During this time of increased investments, we have shifted our ﬁnancial priorities to focus primarily on growth, balanced by the long-term
health of the Company including returns. We will continue to grow through new stores and clubs, and through increasing comparable store and club sales, which
include our e-commerce sales. While leverage remains important to everyday low cost, during this time of increased investments, operating expenses may grow at
a rate that is greater than or equal to the rate of our net sales growth, and operating income may grow at a rate that is equal to or less than the rate of our net sales
growth.
Our objective of balancing growth with returns means that we are focused on efficiently employing assets for return on investment and more effectively managing
working capital to deliver strong free cash ﬂow. We will also continue to provide returns to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Growth
We measure our growth primarily by the amount of the period-over—period growth in our net sales and our comparable store and club sales. We also review the
progress of our digital retail investments by measuring the impact e-commerce sales have on our comparable store and club sales. At times, we make strategic
investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company. These strategic investments may not benefit net sales and comparable store and club sales
in the near term.

Our consolidated net sales decreased $3.6 billion or 0.7% for fiscal 2016 and increased $9.2 billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2015 , when compared to the previous fiscal
year. Net sales for fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by $17.1 billion or 3.5% as a result of ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates and a $1.9 billion decrease
in fuel sales primarily due to the lower selling prices of fuel at our Sam's Club segment. The negative effect of such factors was offset by 1.3% year-over—year
growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. segment and higher e-commerce sales across the Company. The increase in net sales for
ﬁscal 2015 was primarily due to 3.0% year-over—year growth in retail square feet, positive comparable sales in the US. and higher e-commerce sales across the
Company. The increase was partially offset by $5.3 billion of negative impact from ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates for fiscal 2015.
Calendar Comparable Store and Club Sales
Comparable store and club sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing U.S. stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores
and clubs, including e-commerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable
store and club sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable store and club
sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable store and club sales below, we are referring to our
calendar comparable store and club sales calculated using our fiscal calendar. As our fiscal calendar differs from the retail calendar, our fiscal calendar comparable
store and club sales also differ from the retail calendar comparable store and club sales provided in our quarterly earnings releases. Calendar comparable store and
club sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2016 and 2015 , were as follows:
