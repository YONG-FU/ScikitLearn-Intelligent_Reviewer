Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from:
0 insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales;
° banks for customer credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process;
0 consumer financing programs in certain international operations;
° suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and
0 real estate transactions.
The Walmart International segment offers a limited number of consumer credit products, primarily through its financial institutions in select countries. The
receivable balance from consumer credit products was $1.0 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $70 million at January 31, 2016 , compared to a
receivable balance of $1.2 billion , net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $ 114 million at January 31, 2015 . These balances are included in receivables, net, in
the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Inventories
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, ﬁrst-out
("LIFO") method for substantially all of the Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the
retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, ﬁrst-out ("FIFO") method. The retail inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at
the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The inventory at the Sam's Club
segment is valued based on the weighted-average cost using the LIFO method. At January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015 , the Company's inventories valued at
LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while
costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and
includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:
Fiscal Years Ended January 31,
(Amounts in millions) Estimated Useful Lives _ 2016 _ 2015
[Land N/A $ 25,624 $ 26,261 1
Buildings and improvements 3-40 years 96,845 97,496
’Fixtures and equipment 1-30 years 47,033 45,044 ‘
Transportation equipment 3-15 years 2,917 2,807
iConstruction in progress N/A 4,539 5,787 ‘
Property and equipment $ 176,958 $ 177,395
’Accumulated depreciation (66,787) (63,115) ‘
Property and equipment, net $ 110,171 $ 114,280
Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total
depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under ﬁnancing obligations and property under capital leases for ﬁscal 2016 , 2015
and 2014 was $9.4 billion , $9.1 billion and $8.8 billion , respectively. Interest costs capitalized on construction projects were $39 million , $59 million and $78
million in ﬁscal 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
Leases
The Company estimates the expected term of a lease by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an economic penalty exists that would preclude the
abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The expected term
is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the
useful life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are
made for leasehold improvements late in the expected term of a lease and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to
the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum
lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.
The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's
construction of the leased assets result in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, regardless of the
significance of the payments, Accounting Standards
