in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing US. GAAP.
The standard is effective for us beginning 2018, and requires using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach
reﬂecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach
with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We have
begun an assessment of the guidance and expect our revenue to remain primarily unchanged. We are additionally analyzing the effect of the new guidance on
the timing of our recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining contracts. Accordingly, we are still evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU
2014-09 on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements and we have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard.
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842), which introduces a lessee model that brings most
leases onto the balance sheet. The new ASU eliminates the requirement in US. GAAP that entities use bright-line tests in determining lease classiﬁcations
and requires lessors to provide additional transparency into their exposure to the changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure.
The standard is effective for us beginning 2019. We expect the valuation of the right of use assets and lease liabilities to be the present value of our
forecasted ﬁiture lease commitments and are assessing the discount rate to be applied in these valuations. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of
this new guidance on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Accounting for Share-Based Payments
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-B ased Payment Accounting (Topic
718), which simpliﬁes several aspects of the accounting for employees of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the
accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classiﬁcation in the statement of cash ﬂows.
The Company currently has been tracking $3 .6 million of excess tax beneﬁts that were not previously recognized, as required by existing GAAP,
because the related tax deduction did not reduce current taxes payable. Upon adoption of the new standard beginning in year 2017, these beneﬁts will be
recorded on a modiﬁed retrospective bases through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. A valuation allowance will also be recognized as a
part of the cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.

Under all of our stock option plans, new shares are issued when options are exercised.
Employee and Director Stock Option Plans
We have non-qualiﬁed stock options outstanding to employees and directors under various stock option plans. The plans require the exercise price of
options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The options, subject to
termination of employment, generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Historically, our employee options typically vested pro-rata and quarterly over
three years. Option grants to employees, ofﬁcers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control,
as deﬁned in the applicable option agreements.
