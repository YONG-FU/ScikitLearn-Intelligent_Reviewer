Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Based on our 2016 ﬁnancial results and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from operations, will
satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, ﬁlture customer ﬁnancings, and
other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months. We plan for and measure our liquidity and capital
resources through an annual budgeting process. During 2016, our cash ﬂow from operations was $15.3 million, which represents a slight decrease over the
$15.6 million cash ﬂow from operations during 2015. At December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $26.5 million, and we had no debt. This
represents a $2.2 million decrease over our cash balance as of December 31, 2015, which is partially attributed to to our expenditure of $ 1 5 million during
2016 under a share repurchase program that completed in July 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we achieved 10% growth in revenue, 82% gross margin and strong cash collections. While future results
cannot be guaranteed, we expect these trends to continue in the foreseeable future, and believe a signiﬁcant portion of our spending is discretionary and
ﬂexible and that we have the ability to adjust overall cash spending to react, as needed, to any shortfalls in projected cash.

Our primary source of liquidity from operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers, accounts receivable from our customers,
and the management of the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers.
Cash used in our investing activities for 2016 consisted primarily of computer and networking equipment purchases to improve our capacity to
provide hosting services. Cash used in our investing activities for 2015 consisted of $ 1 .5 million computing equipment purchases primarily to satisfy
customer contracts. Approximately 25% of these capital purchases were for computer servers, which are required to deliver our services. The remaining
purchases consisted primarily of leasehold improvements.
Cash used in ﬁnancing activities in 2016 included $15.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and $527 thousand used in the repurchase of
common stock related to the tax impact of vesting restricted awards offset by $205 thousand received from the exercise of stock options. The stock
repurchases were made pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, which was completed July 2016. Cash used in ﬁnancing
activities in 2015 included $15.0 million used to repurchase our common stock and $361 thousand used in the repurchase of common stock related to the tax
impact of vesting restricted awards offset by $8.7 million received from the exercise of stock options. The stock repurchases were made pursuant to a stock
repurchase program authorized by our board of directors, which was completed in October 2015.
Options of Zix Common Stock
We have signiﬁcant options outstanding that are currently vested. There is no assurance that any of these options will be exercised; therefore the
extent of ﬁlture cash inﬂow and related dilution from additional option activity is not certain. The following table summarizes the options that were
outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The vested options are a subset of the outstanding options. The value of the options is the number of options
exercisable into shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share.
