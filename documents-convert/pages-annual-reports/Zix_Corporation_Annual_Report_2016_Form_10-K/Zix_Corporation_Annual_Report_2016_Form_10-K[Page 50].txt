10. Fair Value Measurements
FASB guidance regarding fair value measurement establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.
These tiers include: Level 1, deﬁned as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, deﬁned as inputs
other than quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, deﬁned as
unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
11. Earnings Per Share and Potential Dilution
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of
potential common shares outstanding is included in diluted earnings per share. The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, are as follows:
