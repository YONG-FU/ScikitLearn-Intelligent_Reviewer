The Company has partially reserved its US. net deferred tax assets in 2016 and 2015 due to the uncertainty of future taxable income. The Company
has U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $241 million which begin to expire in 2020. The Company has state credits that net of federal tax
expense total $1.7 million which can be utilized through 2027 and state net operating losses that have various expiration dates. The Company also has tax
credit carryforwards of approximately $4.3 million consisting of business tax credits which begin to expire in 2017 and alternative minimum tax credits
which do not expire.
We have determined that utilization of existing net operating losses against future taxable income is not limited by Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Future ownership changes, however, may limit the company's ability to fully utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards against any
future taxable income.
The Company or one of our subsidiaries ﬁles income tax returns in the US. federal jurisdiction and various states and in the Canadian federal and
provincial jurisdictions. We have not taken a tax position that, if challenged, would have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements or the effective tax rate
for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2016, or during the prior three years. We have determined it is not reasonably possible for the amounts of
unrecognized tax beneﬁts to signiﬁcantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. We are currently subject to a three-year statute of limitations
by major tax jurisdictions.
