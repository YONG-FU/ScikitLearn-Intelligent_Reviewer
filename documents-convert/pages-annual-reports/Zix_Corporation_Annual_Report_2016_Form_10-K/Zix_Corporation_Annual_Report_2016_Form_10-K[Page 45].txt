Under the terms of the 2012 Incentive Plan adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 13, 2012 (the “2012 Plan”), 2,700,000 shares are
available for issuance, plus a number of additional shares (not to exceed 1,327,000) underlying options outstanding under certain of the Company’s prior
equity plans that thereafter terminate or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited, or lapse for any reason. Our shareholders approved an Amended and
Restated 2012 Incentive Plan during our annual meeting held June 24, 2015, increasing the number of shares available for grant by 3,600,000. Awards issued
under the 2012 Plan typically vest pro-rata and quarterly over four years.
Accounting Treatment
We use the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs. Our share-based awards include (i) stock options, (ii)
restricted stock awards, some of which are subject to time-based vesting (“Restricted Stock”) and some of which are subject to performance-based vesting
(“Performance Stock”), and (iii) restricted stock units, some of which are subject to time-based vesting (“RSUs”) and some of which are subject to
performance-based vesting (“Performance RSUs”).
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, the total stock-based compensation expense resulting from stock
options, Restricted Stock, RSUs, Performance RSUs, and Performance Stock was recorded to the following line items of our consolidated statements of
income:

Our 2016 stock-based compensation expense includes $280 thousand related to the accelerated vesting of awards related to our CFO transition. Our
2015 stock-based compensation expense includes $540 thousand related to the accelerated vesting of awards related to our CEO transition. A deferred tax
asset of $5 06 thousand, $625 thousand, and $462 thousand, resulting from stock-based compensation expense associated with awards relating to the
Company’s U.S. operations, was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, there was
$3.3 million oftotal unrecognized stock-based compensation related to non-vested share-based compensation awards granted under the stock option plans.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.
We use the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (“BSOPM”) to determine the fair value of option grants. On January 1, 2006, we elected to use the
“simpliﬁed” method to calculate the estimated life of options granted to employees. The Company continued to use the “simpliﬁed” method for all options
granted through 2013. The Company elected to use the “historical” method to calculate the estimated life of any options that may be granted beginning
2014. The expected stock price volatility was calculated by averaging the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a term equal to the
expected life of the options. We granted 373,187 options in 2016. No options were granted in 2014 or 2015.
The following weighted average assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of options granted during the respective periods:
Year Ended December 31,
v 2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
Risk-free interest rate 1,21% — — l
Qipected option life (years) 5.3 — —
Ezipgctqdjtqch pn'cszvplatility 4,41%) — — l
Qipected dividend yield — — —
liairxaluequpligns,granted $ Lil — — l
The assumptions used in the BSOPM valuation are critical as a change in any given factor could have a material impact on the ﬁnancial results of the
Company. The weighted average grant-date fair value of awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on quoted market price of the
Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
