Our growth model seeks to continually add new users to the subscriber base, while at the same time retaining a high percentage of existing subscribers
whose subscriptions are up for renewal. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we categorized our revenue in the following core verticals: 51% healthcare,
28% ﬁnancial services, 7% government sector, and 14% as other. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we categorized our revenue in the following core
verticals: 54% healthcare, 28% ﬁnancial services, 6% government sector, and 12% as other. Additionally, sales continued from a wide base of distributors —
new ﬁrst year orders (“NFYO’S”) derived from our value-added resellers, OEM and other third party distribution channels for 2016 were 57% of total NFYOs
compared to 64% in 2015 and 58% in 2014. We measure additions to the subscriber base by NFYOs, which is deﬁned as the portion of new orders that are
expected to be recognized into revenue in the ﬁrst twelve months of the contract. NFYOS are summarized in the table below:

r(In thousands) 2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
ﬂemﬁrst ysaggtdgrlalys $ 9.524 $ 19.128 $ 8 318$
Our list pricing has remained generally consistent during the periods shown above. However, there are no assurances that potential increased
competition in this market or other factors, including inﬂation, will not result in future price erosion. Price erosion, should it occur, could have a dampening
effect on order growth and the revenue derived from our new orders.
Revenue Outlook:
We expect continued growth in our core Email Encryption offering and in our new products, along with increased sales from our indirect OEM
distribution and value-added reseller channels to increase our NFYOs in 2017 and increase our year-over—year revenue.
Backlog and Orders
Backlog — Our backlog was $81.7 million at December 31, 2016 compared with $74.2 million at December 31, 2015. The backlog is comprised of
contractual commitments that we expect to amortize into revenue. As of December 31, 2016, the backlog was comprised of the following elements: $27.2
million of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid, $7.1 million billed but unpaid, and approximately $47.4 million of unbilled contracts.
The backlog is recognized into revenue ratably as the services are performed. Approximately 57% of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as
revenue during the next twelve months.
Orders — Total orders in 2016 were $68.6 million compared with $61.0 million in 2015. Total orders are comprised of contract renewals, NFYOS, and
in the case of new multi-year contracts, the years beyond the ﬁrst year of service.
