2016 COMPARED TO 2015
OPERATING ACTIVITIESet cash from operating activities decreased $827 million, or 39%, to $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $2.1 billion in 2015. The
decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to $830 million in lower net earnings in 2016 versus 2015 coupled with a $676 million change
in the lower cost of market adjustment offset by change in working capital in the period.
INVESTING ACTIVITIBSet cash used in investing activities increased $188 million, or 17%, to $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $1.1 billion in 2015
primarily due to funds used for acquisitions in the year partially offset by reduced capital expenditures in 2016. See "Capital Expenditures” in this Item.
FINANCING ACTIVITIEx‘Eet cash from ﬁnancing activities during 2016 totaled $2.4 billion compared to net cash used of$1.1 billion in 2015. The $3.4
billion year on year change was primarily due to $3.1 billion of proceeds from debt offerings in 2016, $265 million more proceeds from issuances of TLLP
common units and $394 million less purchases of common stock in the year partially offset by no borrowings under the TLLP term loan credit agreement in 2016
versus $250 million in 2015. The 2016 debt offerings primarily consisted of the $1.6 billion of senior notes issuances in late 2016 in anticipation of the Western
Reﬁning transaction, the $700 million of senior notes issuances by TLLP in May 2016 and the $750 million of senior notes issued in December 2016 by TLLP.
Dividend payments and payments to noncontrolling interests increased $55 million during 2016 compared to 2015.
2015 COMPARED TO 2014
OPERATING ACTIVITIBSet cash from operating activities increased $767 million, or 56%, to $2.1 billion in 2015 compared to $1.4 billion in 2014. The
increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to $802 million in higher net earnings in 2015 offset by an $86 million increase in
turnaround and branding charges during 2015.
INVESTING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $2.0 billion, or 64% to $1.1 billion in 2015 compared to $3.2 billion in 2014 primarily
due to cash paid of $2.5 billion for TLLP’s acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business with no comparable acquisition in 2015. Partially offsetting this
decrease was an increase in cash capital expenditures of $345 million primarily in our Refining segment. See "Capital Expenditures” in this Item.
FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used in financing activities during 2015 totaled $1.1 billion compared to net cash from ﬁnancing activities of $1.6 billion in
2014. The $2.6 billion change was primarily due to TLLP’s ﬁnancing activities during 2014 including senior note issuances of $1.3 billion, net proceeds of
approximately $949 million from the issuance of TLLP common units, and borrowings on the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility to fund its 2014 acquisitions.
Additionally, we completed the issuance of $300 million of 5.125% senior notes used to repay the 9.750% Senior Notes due 2019. Dividend payments and
payments to noncontrolling interests increased $173 million and purchases of common stock under our share repurchase programs increased $144 million
during 2015 versus 2014.
