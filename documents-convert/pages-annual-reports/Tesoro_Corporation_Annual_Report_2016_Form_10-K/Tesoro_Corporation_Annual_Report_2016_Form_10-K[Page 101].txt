Unrecognized tax beneﬁts increased by $159 million in 2015 for tax positions taken on amended returns ﬁled for 2009-2010. The positions taken exclude
certain tax credits for blending biofuels into reﬁned products from taxable income. These tax credits were received from the federal government during the
years being amended. However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the issue, we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will
sustain the claims. Therefore, we have neither recognized a tax benefit, nor recorded a receivable for this item.
NOTE 14 — BENEFIT PLANS
BENEFITS SUMMARY
We sponsor four defined benefit pension plans, including one qualified plan and three nonqualified plans, which are described below.
0 The funded qualiﬁed employee retirement plan (the "Retirement Plan”) provides beneﬁts to all eligible employees. Beneﬁts are determined based on ﬁnal
average compensation and years of service through December 31, 2010, and a cash balance account based formula for service beginning January 1,
2011. Although our funded employee retirement plan fully meets all of the funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we contributed
$60 million each year during 2016, 2015 and 2014.
0 The unfunded nonqualiﬁed restoration retirement plan provides for the restoration of retirement beneﬁts to certain senior level employees that are not
provided under the qualified retirement plan due to limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
0 The unfunded nonqualiﬁed executive security plan provides certain executive ofﬁcers and other key personnel with supplemental pension beneﬁts.
These beneﬁts are provided by a nonqualiﬁed, noncontributory plan and are based on years of service and compensation. We made payments of$15
million, $1 million and $5 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, for current retiree obligations under the plan.
0 The unfunded nonqualiﬁed supplemental executive retirement plan provides eligible senior level executives a supplemental pension beneﬁt in excess of
those earned under the qualified retirement plan. Effective January 1, 2015, this plan was frozen to new participants.
Tesoro provides health care beneﬁts to retirees who met certain eligibility requirements and were participating in our group health insurance program at
retirement. In addition, Tesoro sponsors a 401(k) plan which provides for eligible employees to make contributions, subject to certain limitations, into designated
investment funds with a matching contribution by Tesoro.
