LEASES. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases” ("ASU 2016-02”), which amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting and
adds additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the
balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classiﬁed as either ﬁnance or operating, with classiﬁcation affecting the pattern of
expense recognition in the income statement and presentation of cash flow in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted and modiﬁed retrospective
application is required. We are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements.
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” ("ASU 2016-
09”), which simpliﬁes several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including accounting for income taxes, cash ﬂow
presentation of tax impacts, forfeitures, and liability versus equity accounting due to statutory tax withholding requirements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. As of January 1, 2016, we early adopted ASU 2016-09 on a
prospective basis and with respect to the guidance on forfeitures, we have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures on the date of grant to account for the
estimated number of awards for which the requisite service period will not be rendered. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 had a $16 million impact for the year
ended December 31, 2016, resulting in a lower effective tax rate and immaterial changes to our cash flow presentation.
CREDIT LOSSESn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” ("ASU 2016-13”), which amends
guidance on the impairment of ﬁnancial instruments. The ASU estimates credit losses based on expected losses, modiﬁes the impairment model for available-for-
sale debt securities and provides for a simpliﬁed accounting model for purchased ﬁnancial assets with credit deterioration. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. While we are still evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13, we do not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on our financial statements.
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWSn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Clariﬁcation of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” ("ASU 2016-15”),
which eliminates the diversity in practice related to the classiﬁcation of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash ﬂows, by adding or clarifying
guidance on eight speciﬁc cash flow issues. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early
adoption permitted. The amendments in this update should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, unless deemed impracticable, in which case,
prospective application is permitted. We early adopted this standard retrospectively as of December 31, 2016, which did not have an impact on our ﬁnancial
statements.
DEFINITION OF A BUSINESSJanuary 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-01, "Clarifying the Deﬁnition of a Business” ("ASU 2017-01”), which revises the
deﬁnition of a business and assists in the evaluation of when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business. ASU 2017-01 is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted
under certain circumstances. At this time, we are evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial statements.
