(14) the incurrence of Indebtedness arising from agreements with T LLP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries providing for indemniﬁcation,
adjustment of purchase price, earn—outs, or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the disposition or acquisition of
any business, assets or a Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, other than guarantees of Indebtedness incurred or assumed by any
Person acquiring all or any portion of such business, assets or Subsidiary for the purpose of ﬁnancing such acquisition; and
(15) the incurrence by TLLP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount at any time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (a) $250.0 million and (b) 5.0% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (determined as of the date of incurrence
and after giving effect to the use of proceeds therefrom).
TLLP will not incur, and will not permit any Guarantor to incur, any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right
of payment to any other Indebtedness of TLLP or such Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Notes
and the applicable Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness shall be deemed to be contractually
subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of TLLP solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured on a ﬁrst or junior Lien
basis.
For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 4.09, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (15) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to Section
4.09(a) hereof, TLLP will be permitted to classify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion
of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Section 4.09; provided that Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements outstanding on
the Issue Date will initially be deemed to have been incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1) of the deﬁnition of “Permitted
Debt.”
The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassiﬁcation of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of
dividends on Disqualiﬁed Equity in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualiﬁed Equity will not be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualiﬁed Equity for purposes of this Section 4.09. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4.09, the maximum
amount of Indebtedness that TLLP or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this Section 4.09 shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result
of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates or currency values.
The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:
(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount;
(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and
(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the speciﬁed Person, the lesser of:
(A) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and
(B) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.
For purposes of determining compliance with any US. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the US. dollar-equivalent
principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term debt, or ﬁrst committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred
to reﬁnance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such reﬁnancing would cause the applicable US. dollar-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such reﬁnancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such reﬁnancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such
Indebtedness being reﬁnanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such reﬁnancing. The principal amount of any Indebtedness incurred to reﬁnance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being reﬁnanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is
denominated that is in effect on the date of such reﬁnancing.
