0 The 2011 Plan permits the grant of options, SARs, restricted common stock, restricted stock units and incentive bonuses (which may be paid in cash,
stock or a combination thereof), any of which may be performance-based. The 2011 Plan became effective in May 2011 and no awards may be granted
under the 2011 Plan on or after February 2021. Stock options may be granted at exercise prices not less than the fair market value on the date the
options are granted.
0 The 2006 Plan permits the grant of options, restricted common stock, deferred stock units, performance stock awards, other stock-based awards and
cash-based awards. The 2006 Plan became effective in May 2006. Stock options may be granted at exercise prices not less than the fair market value on
the date the options are granted. Options granted become exercisable after one year in 33% annual increments and expire 10 years from the date of
grant. No further awards may be granted under this plan.
0 The Amended and Restated Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan, which expired in May 2006, allowed grants in a variety of forms, including restricted
stock, nonqualiﬁed stock options, SARs, performance share and performance unit awards. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we no longer have
outstanding awards in this plan, although there were awards outstanding during 2015 which were all exercised.
0 The 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan provided for the grant of nonqualiﬁed stock options over the life of the plan to eligible non-
employee directors of Tesoro. These automatic, non-discretionary stock options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value per
share of Tesoro’s common stock at the date of grant. The term of each option is 10 years, and an option becomes exercisable six months after it is
granted. The plan expired in February 2010 and no further options may be granted under this plan.
TLGP maintains a unit-based compensation plan for officers and directors of TLGP and its afﬁliates. The TLLP 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended
and restated in October 2016, ("TLLP Plan”) permits the grant of options, restricted units, phantom units, unit appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights,
unit awards and other unit-based awards. Awards granted during 2016 under the TLLP Plan will be settled with TLLP units. Compensation expense for these
awards was not material to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014.

We have aggregated expenses for certain award types as they are not considered signiﬁcant. The income tax effect recognized in the income statement for
stock-based compensation was a beneﬁt of $28 million, $28 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Included in the tax benefit of $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $16 million of tax benefit attributable to excess tax beneﬁts from exercises
and vestings that occurred during the year, the effects of which were recorded in the Statement of Consolidated Operations pursuant to ASU 2016-09. The
reduction in current taxes payable recognized from tax deductions resulting from exercises and vestings under all of our stock-based compensation
arrangements totaled $37 million, $75 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
A SAR entitles an employee to receive cash in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of exercise
over the grant price of the SAR. Our SARs become exercisable after three years and expire seven years from the date of grant. The fair value of each SAR is
estimated at the end of each reporting period using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We did not grant SARs to our employees during the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. We paid cash of $21 million, $44 million and $31 million to settle SARs exercised during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
We had $6 million and $41 million recorded in other current liabilities associated with our SARs awards in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively.
