NOTE 10 — DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, our proﬁt margins, earnings and cash ﬂows are impacted by the timing, direction and overall change in pricing for
commodities used throughout our operations. We use non-trading derivative instruments to manage our exposure to the following:
0 price risks associated with the purchase or sale of feedstocks, reﬁned products and energy supplies related to our reﬁneries, terminals, marketing fuel
inventory and customers;
0 price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels;
0 future emission credit requirements; and
0 exchange rate fluctuations on our purchases of Canadian crude oil.
Our accounting for derivative instruments depends on whether the underlying commodity will be used or sold in the normal course of business. For
contracts where the crude oil or reﬁned products are expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business, we apply the normal purchase normal sale
exception and follow the accrual method of accounting. All other derivative instruments are recorded at fair value using mark-to-market accounting.
