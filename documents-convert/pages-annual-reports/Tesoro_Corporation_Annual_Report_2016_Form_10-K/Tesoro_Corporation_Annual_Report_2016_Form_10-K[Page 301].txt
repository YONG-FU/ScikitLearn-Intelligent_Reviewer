Except as otherwise provided in Section 10.05 hereof, no Guarantor may sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or
consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Issuers or another Guarantor,
unless:
(1) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and
(2) either:
(a) subject to Section 10.05 hereof, the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving
any such consolidation or merger is a Guarantor, or unconditionally assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under this Indenture and its
Note Guarantee on the terms set forth herein or therein, pursuant to a supplemental indenture in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee; or
(b) the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Indenture, including
without limitation, Section A .10 hereof.
In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor Person, by supplemental indenture, executed
and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee endorsed upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of
all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the
Guarantor with the same effect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note
Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee.
All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and beneÔ¨Åt under this Indenture as the Note Guarantees theretofore and
thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Note Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and i hereof, and notwithstanding clauses 2(a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes
will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property
of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.
