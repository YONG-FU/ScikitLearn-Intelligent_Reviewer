(a) We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash ﬂow pattern to the
expected pension and other postretirement benefit payments to be made.
(b) The expected return on plan assets reﬂects the weighted-average of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held for the
Retirement Plan. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the Retirement Plan’s
investments.
ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES TO DETERMINE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION
December 31,
2016 2015
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.90% 7.20%
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate) 4.80% 4.80%
Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2024 2024
Assumed health care cost trend rates could have a signiﬁcant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. However, at December 31, 2016, a
one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have less than a million dollar effect on the service and interest cost components
and on our postretirement benefit obligation.
