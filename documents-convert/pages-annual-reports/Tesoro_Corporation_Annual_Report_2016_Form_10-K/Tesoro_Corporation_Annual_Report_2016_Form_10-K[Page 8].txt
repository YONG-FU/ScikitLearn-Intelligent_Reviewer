title to approximately 5.2 million barrels of crude oil in transit or in Panama '7 "
for delivery to our refineries on the West Coast or to third parties. Our reﬁneries process both heavy and light crude oil. Light crude oil,
when refined, produces a greater proportion of higher value transportation
fuels such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and as a result is typically more
expensive than heavy crude oil. In contrast, heavy crude oil produces more
low value by-products and heavy residual oils. These lower value products
can be upgraded to higher value products through additional, more complex
and expensive refining processes.
