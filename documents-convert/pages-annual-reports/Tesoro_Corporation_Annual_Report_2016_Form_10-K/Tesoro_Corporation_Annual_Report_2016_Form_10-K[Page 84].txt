The replacement cost of our crude oil and reﬁned product inventories exceeded carrying value by approximately $107 million at December 31, 2016. We
recorded a lower of cost or market reserve of $359 million at December 31, 2015 to cost of sales for our crude oil, refined products, oxygenates and by-product
inventories to adjust the carrying value of our inventories to reﬂect replacement cost. We reverse any lower of cost or market reserve in the subsequent period
because the inventories are sold or used and then perform a complete lower of cost or market assessment of ending inventories at the end of each reporting
period to determine if a reserve is required.
