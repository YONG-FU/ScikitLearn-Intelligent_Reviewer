CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LlQUlDITY
OVERVIEW
We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability
of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for
transportation fuels, weather conditions, ﬂuctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global
economic conditions. See "Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for further information related to risks and other factors. Future
capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions. Debt is described in
greater detail in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
