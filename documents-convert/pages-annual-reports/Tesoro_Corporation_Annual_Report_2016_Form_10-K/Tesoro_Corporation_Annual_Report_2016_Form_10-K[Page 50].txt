2016 DEBT TRANSACTIONS
During 2016, both Tesoro and TLLP were active in the debt markets, in part due to acquisition related activities. In anticipation of the Western Reﬁning
merger, Tesoro completed a $1.6 billion senior notes offering in December 2016 and entered into a ﬁnancing commitment letter in November 2016 committing
banks to provide up to $2.2 billion in the form of a bridge credit facility. In addition, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to take advantage of
improved terms and to better position itself for funding the Western Reﬁning transaction with an incremental $1.0 billion capacity, at which time the
commitment letter was reduced to $1.2 billion and ultimately terminated. In connection with acquisitions from Tesoro, TLLP completed a $750 million offering in
December 2016 and completed another offering of $700 million in May 2016. In addition to a senior notes exchange in February 2016, TLLP entered in a new
$1.0 billion Dropdown Credit Facility and amended its revolving credit facility in January 2016.
See Note 12 in Item 8 for a more detailed discussion regarding the company’s debt transactions in the year.
CREDIT FACILITIES OVERVIEW
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations with additional sources available under borrowing capacity from our revolving lines of
credit. We ended 2016 with $3.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, no borrowings outstanding under the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility (the
"Revolving Credit Facility”) or the TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility and $330 million of borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We believe
available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements.
