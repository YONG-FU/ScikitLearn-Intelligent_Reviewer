PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
UTILIZATION AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENﬁSecember 2015, we laid out plans to deliver $500 to $600 million of improvements to operating
income in 2016 resulting from improved utilization and operational effectiveness as compared to our 2015 operating performance. In 2015, we experienced
lower than normal utilization and operational effectiveness primarily due to the work stoppage and an extended turnaround at our Utah reﬁnery, both of which
negatively impacted our operating results during those times. As a result, we set forth these improvement objectives to provide a way to compare our operating
results in 2016 to 2015, exclusive of market impacts and the annual improvements to operating income discussed below. Our expectations for 2016 were a
Tesoro Index (as deﬁned in our Glossary of Terms) of $12 to $14 per throughput barrel in our Reﬁning segment, fuel margins of 11 to 14 cents per gallon in our
Marketing segment and crude oil differentials reﬂecting transportation costs which impact our Reﬁning segment results. For the full year 2016, the Tesoro Index
was at the low end of the range and Marketing fuel margins were in line with expectations. Crude oil differentials were signiﬁcantly narrower than expectations
and resulted in lower year-over-year capture rates and reﬁning proﬁtability. For the full year 2016, we delivered an estimated $485 million of year-over-year
improvements compared to 2015 from higher utilization and operational efﬁciencies versus our original commitment of $500 to $600 million, which was
revised to $400 to $500 million in the second quarter of 2016. Given the results in 2016 and the expectations about the Tesoro Index and marketing fuel
margins remain the same as experienced in 2016 along with the crude oil differentials existing in the market at the end of 2016, no separate improvement goal
for utilization and operational effectiveness is being established for 2017.
OTHER ANN UAL IMPROVEMENTISDecember 2015, we also committed to delivering $400 to $500 million of annual improvements to operating income
in 2016, consisting of $200 to $250 million in Reﬁning, $175 to $200 million in TLLP and $25 to $50 million in Marketing. For the full year 2016, we estimate
that we delivered approximately $420 million of annual improvements to operating income, including Reﬁning segment improvements of approximately $245
million, TLLP segment improvements of approximately $130 million and Marketing segment improvements of approximately $45 million. Estimated TLLP
operating income improvements were below the range primarily due to the weak commodity price environment, which impacted crude oil and natural gas
volumes and organic growth. Our 2016 achievements include the following in our Refining segment:
- Renegotiated a legacy product supply contract at our Los Angeles refinery, which will allow for greater yield flexibility and increased alternatives for sale
and distribution of specialty products;
0 Installed a new preflash tower at our Los Angeles refinery, which allows for greater yield flexibility and energy savings;
- Sourced new types of crude oils resulting in crude optimizations;
- Shared new crude oil cargos between the Los Angeles refinery and our Martinez refinery;
- Improved crude blending capabilities at the Carson crude terminal that resulted in higher throughput volumes;
0 Improved pipeline connectivity between the Los Angeles refinery sites;
0 Integrated naphtha and gasoline blendstocks on the West Coast;
- Re-distributed in-bound crude oil to our Kenai reﬁnery during maintenance and turnaround activities at our Anacortes reﬁnery to optimize our west
coast system;
- Transported intermediates from our Dickinson refinery to our Anacortes and Salt Lake City refineries for additional upgrading;
- Operated our Salt Lake City reﬁnery’s ﬂuid catalytic cracker during the third quarter turnaround by running intermediates from our Dickinson reﬁnery
and waxy crude oil; and
0 Completed the second phase of the Salt Lake City Refinery Expansion project.
Additionally, in our TLLP segment, operating income was positively impacted by the strategic acquisition of assets from Tesoro during 2016, optimization of
existing terminalling and transportation assets and the completion of the second phase of gathering systems connecting additional wells located in the North
Dakota Williston Basin/Bakken Shale area (the "High Plains System”). Further, our Marketing segment experienced continued growth in its retail station network
with the addition of 95 sites during the year.
As announced in November 2016, we plan to deliver $475 to $575 million of annual improvements to operating income during 2017 in addition to the
improvements delivered in 2016.
