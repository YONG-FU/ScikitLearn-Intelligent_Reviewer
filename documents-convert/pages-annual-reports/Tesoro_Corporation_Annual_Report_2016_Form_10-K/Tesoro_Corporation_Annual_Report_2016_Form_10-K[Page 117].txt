NOTE 21 — CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Separate condensed consolidating ﬁnancial information of Tesoro Corporation (the ”Parent”), subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors are presented
below. At December 31, 2016, Tesoro and certain subsidiary guarantors have fully and unconditionally guaranteed our 2017 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes,
2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. TLLP, in which we had a 34% ownership interest as of December 31, 2016, and other subsidiaries have not guaranteed these
obligations. As a result of these guarantee arrangements, we are required to present the following condensed consolidating ﬁnancial information, which should
be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. This information is provided as an alternative to providing
separate ﬁnancial statements for guarantor subsidiaries. Separate ﬁnancial statements of Tesoro’s subsidiary guarantors are not included because the guarantees
are full and unconditional and these subsidiary guarantors are 100% owned and are jointly and severally liable for Tesoro’s outstanding senior notes. The
information is presented using the equity method of accounting for investments in subsidiaries. Certain intercompany and intracompany transactions between
subsidiaries are presented gross and eliminated in the consolidating adjustments column. Additionally, the results of operations of the Hawaii Business have been
reported as discontinued operations in these condensed consolidating statements of operations and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014.
