RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK
The fair value of each restricted share on the grant date is equal to the market price of our common stock on that date. The estimated fair value of our
restricted common stock is amortized over the vesting period primarily using the straight-line method. These awards primarily vest in annual increments ratably
over 3 years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested was $2 million, $4 million and $2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The weighted-average
grant-date fair value per share of restricted common stock granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $85.51, $90.40 and $61.76, respectively. Unrecognized
compensation cost related to our non-vested restricted common stock totaled $4 million as of December 31, 2016. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The fair value of non-vested restricted common stock, as of December 31, 2016, totaled $10 million.

STOCK OPTIONS
Under the terms of our stock option plans, the exercise price of options granted is equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The
fair value of each option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The estimated fair value of these stock options is amortized
over the vesting period using the straight-line method. There were no options granted to our employees during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Our options primarily become exercisable after one year in 33% annual increments and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The total intrinsic value for
options exercised during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $3 million, $19 million and $25 million, respectively. There were no non-vested stock options as of
December 31, 2016. The reduction in current taxes payable from tax deductions associated with stock options exercised during 2016 totaled $1 million.
