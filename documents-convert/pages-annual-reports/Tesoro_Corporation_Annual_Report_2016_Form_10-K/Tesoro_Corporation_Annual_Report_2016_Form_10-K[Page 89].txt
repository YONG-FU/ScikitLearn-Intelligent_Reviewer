Our derivative instruments can include Forward Contracts, Futures Contracts, over-the-counter swaps, including swap Contracts, Options, and OTC Option
Contracts. Forward Contracts are agreements to buy or sell the commodity at a predetermined price at a speciﬁed future date. Futures Contracts are
standardized agreements, traded on a futures exchange, to buy or sell the commodity at a predetermined price at a specified future date. Options provide the
right, but not the obligation to buy or sell the commodity at a speciﬁed price in the future. Swap Contracts and OTC Option Contracts require cash settlement for
the commodity based on the difference between a contracted ﬁxed or ﬂoating price and the market price on the settlement date. Certain of these contracts
require cash collateral to be received or paid if our asset or liability position, respectively, exceeds speciﬁed thresholds. We believe that we have minimal credit
risk with respect to our counterparties.
The following table presents the fair value of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The fair value amounts below are presented on
a gross basis and do not reflect the netting of asset and liability positions permitted under the terms of our master netting arrangements including cash collateral
on deposit with, or received from, brokers. We offset the recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty
in our ﬁnancial statements when a legal right of offset exists. As a result, the asset and liability amounts below will not agree with the amounts presented in our
consolidated balance sheets.

(a) Certain of our derivative contracts, under master netting arrangements, include both asset and liability positions. We offset both the fair value amounts and any
related cash collateral amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when there is a legally enforceable right and
an intention to settle net or simultaneously. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had provided cash collateral amounts of $88 million and $12
million, respectively, related to our unrealized derivative positions. Cash collateral amounts are netted with mark-to-market derivative assets.
