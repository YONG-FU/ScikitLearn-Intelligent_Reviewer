consummation of the Asset Sale to such date, the "EirstllommitmenLApplicationPeriod”), and in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason after the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application Period and before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith,
TLLP (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) enters into another Acceptable Commitment (a "S,e,c,o,nd,C,ommitment") prior to the
expiration of the First Commitment Application Period and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the
Second Commitment, it being understood that if a Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied,
then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.
Pending the ﬁnal application of any Net Proceeds, TLLP or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by this Indenture.
To the extent Net Proceeds ﬁom an Asset Sale exceed amounts that are applied or invested as provided and within the time period set forth in the
second preceding paragraph, such excess amount will be deemed to constitute “ExcessProceeds.” Within ﬁve days after the date on which the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $100.0 million (or, at the Issuers’ option, any earlier date), the Issuers will make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of
Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Indenture with respect to
offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other parz’ passu Indebtedness
that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount (or
accreted value) thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, TLLP or any Restricted Subsidiary may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and TLLP or the representative of such other pari passu
Indebtedness will select such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased, on a pro rata basis between the Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness,
with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or pari passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination.
Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
TLLP will comply with the requirements of Rule l4e-l under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent
such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conﬂict with the provisions of Section 3.09 hereof or this Section 4.10, TLLP will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 3 .09 hereof or this Section 4.10 by virtue of such compliance.
Section 4.1 1 Transactions with Aﬁiliates.
(a) TLLP will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its
properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets ﬁom, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan,
advance or guarantee with, or for the beneﬁt of, any Affiliate of TLLP
(each, an “Afﬁliatej‘iansac,tion”) if such Afﬁliate Transaction involves aggregate consideration in excess of $25.0 million, unless:
(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to TLLP or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been
obtained in a comparable transaction by TLLP or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person or, if no comparable transaction is available with
which to compare such Afﬁliate Transaction, such Afﬁliate Transaction is otherwise fair to TLLP or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a ﬁnancial
point of View; and
(2) TLLP delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Afﬁliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $75.0 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the General Partner set forth in an Officers’ Certiﬁcate certifying that
such Afﬁliate Transaction complies with clause (1) of this Section 4.ﬂ(a,) and that such Affiliate Transaction has been approved by either the Conﬂicts
Committee of the Board of Directors of the General Partner (so long as the members of the Conﬂicts Committee approving the Affiliate Transaction are
disinterested) or a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the General Partner.
(b) The following items will not be deemed to be Afﬁliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 1(a) hereof:
(1) reasonable fees and compensation paid to or for the beneﬁt of any employee, ofﬁcer or director of TLLP, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
the General Partner, and any employment agreement, customary beneﬁt program or arrangement (including vacation plans, health and life insurance
plans, deferred compensation plans and retirement or savings and similar plans), equity award, equity option or equity appreciation agreement or plan,
ofﬁcer or director indemniﬁcation agreement or any similar arrangement entered into by TLLP, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or the General Partner
existing on the Issue
