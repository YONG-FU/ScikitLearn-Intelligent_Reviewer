(a) Includes only the exercise price for options to purchase common stock. No value is included in this column for restricted stock units, performance share awards or
market stock units since they do not have an exercise, or strike, price.
(b) For illustrative purposes, a maximum payout (Le, a 200% ratio) has been assumed for vesting and payout of outstanding performance share awards and market
stock unit grants.
(c) The number of securities to be issued upon exercise under these approved plans includes 122,755 options to purchase common stock, 46,932 restricted stock units,
756,050 performance share awards, and 2,140,728 market stock units. Each performance share award and market stock unit shown in the table represents a right
to receive (upon vesting and payout) a speciﬁed number of our common shares. Vesting and payout may be conditioned upon achievement of pre-determined
performance objectives or only upon continued service with us and our afﬁliates. For illustrative purposes, the maximum payout (Le, a 200% ratio) provided by the
provisions of the award agreements has been assumed for vesting and payout of performance share awards and market stock unit grants. Payout at target levels
(Le, a 100% ratio) would result in 1,618,076 securities to be issued and 4,524,302 securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation
plans.
(d) Stock options granted in connection with the inducement awards of the CEO Agreement were not granted under an equity compensation plan.
