Fuel Margin (C/gallon) 12-7¢ 14-0¢ 10-3¢ OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSEBe decrease of $52 million in operating
expenses was primarily driven by the conversion of our retail stations to the
M50 model that reduced costs associated with management of station
operations.
(a) In December 2014, we converted our company-operated retail stations to MSO retail stations. The impact of this change was not material to our Marketing
segment results.
(b) Primarily includes royalty and franchise income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and primarily merchandise revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2014.
(c) Starting in 2015, we changed our segment reporting methodology to better reﬂect market trends. This primarily included discounting the price that Marketing pays
for reﬁned product to Reﬁning by the value of renewable identiﬁcation numbers ("Rle"). This change was effective January 1, 2015 and we have not adjusted
ﬁnancial information presented for our Reﬁning and Marketing segments for the year ended December 31, 2014. Had we made this change effective January 1,
2014, operating income in our Reﬁning segment would have reduced by $125 million with a corresponding increase to operating income in our Marketing segment
for the year ended December 31, 2014.
