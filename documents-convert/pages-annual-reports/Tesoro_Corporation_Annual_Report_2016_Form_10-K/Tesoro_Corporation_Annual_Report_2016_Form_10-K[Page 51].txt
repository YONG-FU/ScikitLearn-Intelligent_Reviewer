COVENANTS. Our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, senior notes, TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, TLLP Dropdown Credit Facility and TLLP senior notes
include certain negative, afﬁrmative and ﬁnancial covenants, a number of which will either no longer apply or become less restrictive if an investment grade
rating from either Moody's Investors Service or S&P Global Ratings is achieved, that may limit or restrict the ability of Tesoro and its subsidiaries to:
0 pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;
0 enter into certain hedging agreements;
- incur additional indebtedness;
- sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;
- incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;
- engage in certain business activities;
0 make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;
- engage in certain investments, mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and
0 enter into non-arm’s length transactions with affiliates.
We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends (distributions for TLLP) or repurchase stock under our current programs. We
also have ﬁnancial covenants that require Tesoro or TLLP to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. There were no changes to the TLLP Revolving
Credit Facility covenants during the year ended December 31, 2016. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our debt obligations.
TLLP REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AMEN DMONTanuary 29, 2016, TLLP amended its existing secured TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of the
amendment, TLLP decreased the aggregate available facility limit from $900 million to $600 million and improved terms related to pricing and ﬁnancial
covenants.
