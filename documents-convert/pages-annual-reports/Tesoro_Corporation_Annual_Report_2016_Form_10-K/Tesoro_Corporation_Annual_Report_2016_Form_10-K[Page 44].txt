OPERATIONAL DATA AN D RESULTlSlanagement uses average revenue per barrel and average revenue per MMBtu to evaluate performance and compare
proﬁtability to other companies in the industry. We calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by total throughput and total processing volumes,
respectively, while average revenue per MMBtu is calculated as revenue divided by total volume. Investors and analysts use these ﬁnancial measures to help
analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These ﬁnancial measures should not be considered as an alternative to
segment operating income, revenues and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
MARKET OVERVIEW. During the past year, spot prices of the commodities that TLLP handles, including crude oil, natural gas, and reﬁned products, declined,
while natural gas liquids increased. The lower price levels along with increased volatility in the commodity price environment created challenges for crude oil
and natural gas producers who modiﬁed their drilling and production plans. The U.S. oil and gas drilling rig count continued to see declines in the ﬁrst half of
2016 but reversed course in the second half of the year leaving year-over-year count relatively unchanged. Looking forward, price appreciation, improved
producer economics, advanced drilling techniques and better well management along with a backlog of uncompleted wells available for completion could
positively impact overall U.S. production volumes.
Lower retail prices and favorable economic conditions throughout 2016 supported increased demand for reﬁned products from TLLP’s downstream
reﬁning and marketing customers. Changes in the U.S. political landscape, namely around the lifting of the 40 year old crude oil export ban in December 2015,
had a minimal impact on TLLP’s business and TLLP believes this will continue to be the case in the short term. TLLP continues to monitor the impact of these
changes in market prices and fundamentals as it relates to TLLP’s business. Currently, TLLP believes its diversiﬁed portfolio, which is underpinned by long-term
contracts, many of which are supported by minimum volume commitments, adequately supports its goals and objectives outlined above.
The results of operations for TLLP’s natural gas gathering and processing operations are shown in Mbpd, per barrel, MMBtu and per MMBtu amounts.

(a) Prior to deconsolidation of Rendezvous Gas Services, L.L.C. ("R65") as of January 1, 2016, fees paid by TLLP to RGS were eliminated upon consolidation and third-
party transactions, including revenue and throughput volumes, were included in TLLP’s results of operations. Third party volumes associated with R65, included in
gas gathering volume for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were 141 thousand MMBtu/d and 148 thousand MMBtu/d, respectively, and reduced
TLLP’s average gas gathering revenue per MMBtu by approximately $0.05 for both periods.
(b) TLLP commenced natural gas gathering and processing operations with the acquisition of the Rockies Natural Gas Business in December 2014. Per day calculations
only reflect the period of 2014 that TLLP owned the Rockies Natural Gas Business.
