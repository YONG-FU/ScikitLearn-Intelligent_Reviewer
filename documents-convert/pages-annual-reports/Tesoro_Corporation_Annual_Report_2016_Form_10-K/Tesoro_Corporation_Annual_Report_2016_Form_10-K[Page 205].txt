(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of such Notes properly
tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; and
(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes accepted for purchase together with an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions of such Notes being purchased by the Issuers.
The Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes
(or, if all the Notes are then in global form, it will make such payment through the facilities of DTC), and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or
cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
provided, that each new Note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $ 1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuers will publicly announce
the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.
(0) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.15,, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of
Control Triggering Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements
set forth in this Section A .15, and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Oﬁ‘er or (2) notice of redemption has
been given pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.
A Change of Control Offer may be made with respect to the Notes in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a deﬁnitive agreement for the Change of Control Triggering Event is in place at the time of
making the Change of Control Offer.
With respect to the Notes, in the event that Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes tender and do not
withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and TLLP (or the third party making the Change of Control Offer as provided above) purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, TLLP or such third party shall have the right, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain
outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
on the Notes that remain outstanding to the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date).
Section 4.16 Additional Guarantors.
If, after the Issue Date, any wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiary (other than Finance Corp.) of TLLP that is not already a Guarantor guarantees any other
Indebtedness of either of the Issuers under a Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $50.0 million, then that Subsidiary will become a
Guarantor by executing and delivering a supplemental indenture to the Trustee within 30 Business Days of the date on which it guaranteed or incurred such
Indebtedness; provided that the preceding shall not apply to Subsidiaries of TLLP that have been properly designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in
accordance with this Indenture for so long as they continue to constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the preceding, any Guarantee of a
Restricted Subsidiary that was incurred pursuant to this Section 4.16 will be released in accordance with Section 10.06 hereof.
Section 4.17 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors of the General Partner may designate any Subsidiary of TLLP to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not
cause a Default. If a Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by TLLP
and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the
designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.01 hereof or under one or more clauses of the deﬁnition of
“Permitted Investments”, as determined by TLLP; provided that any designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and
if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the deﬁnition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of TLLP as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by ﬁling with the Trustee a certiﬁed copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the General Partner giving effect to such designation and an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate certifying that such designation
complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.01 hereof If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted
to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09 hereof, TLLP will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the General Partner may at any
time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
