Section 4.12 Liens.
TLLP will not and will not permit any Guarantor to, create, incur, assume or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind
(other than Permitted Liens) securing Indebtedness upon any of their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired, unless:
(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Obligations of TLLP or a Guarantor, the Notes or Note Guarantees, as applicable, are
contemporaneously secured by a Lien on such property or assets on a senior basis to the Subordinated Obligations so secured with the same priority
that the Notes or Note Guarantees, as applicable, have to such Subordinated Obligations until such time as such Subordinated Obligations are no longer
so secured by a Lien; and
(2) in the case of Liens securing Senior Indebtedness of TLLP or a Guarantor, the Notes or Note Guarantees, as applicable, are contemporaneously
secured by a Lien on such property or assets on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Indebtedness so secured until such time as such Senior
Indebtedness is no longer so secured by a Lien.
Any Lien on property or assets of TLLP or any Guarantor created for the beneﬁt of Holders of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall
provide by its terms that such Lien shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at such time as there are no other Liens of any kind
(other than Permitted Liens) on such property or assets securing Indebtedness.
