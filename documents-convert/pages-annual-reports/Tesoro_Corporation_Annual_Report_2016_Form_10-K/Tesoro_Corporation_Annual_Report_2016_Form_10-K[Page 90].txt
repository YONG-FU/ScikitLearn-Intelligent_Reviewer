NOTE 11 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
RECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We classify ﬁnancial assets and liabilities according to the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities classiﬁed as level 1 instruments are valued
based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices, such as liquidity, that are observable for the asset or liability. Our level 2 instruments include derivatives
valued using market quotations from independent price reporting agencies, third-party brokers and commodity exchange price curves that are corroborated
with market data. Level 3 instruments are valued using signiﬁcant unobservable inputs that are not supported by sufﬁcient market activity. We do not have any
financial assets or liabilities classified as level 3 at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015.
Our ﬁnancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include derivative instruments. Additionally, our ﬁnancial liabilities include
obligations for Rle and cap and trade emission credits for the state of California (together with RINs, our "Environmental Credit Obligations”). See Note 10 for
further information on our derivative instruments. Amounts presented below for Environmental Credit Obligations represent the estimated fair value amount at
each balance sheet date for which we do not have sufﬁcient RINs and California cap and trade credits to satisfy our obligations to the EPA and the state of
California, respectively.
