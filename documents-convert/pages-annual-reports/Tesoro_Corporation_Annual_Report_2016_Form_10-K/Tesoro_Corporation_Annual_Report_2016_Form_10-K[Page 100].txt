With the acquisition of Virent, we acquired federal and state Net Operating Losses ("NOLs”), as well as federal and state credit carryforwards. We have
recorded a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 for most of the federal NOLs, all of the state NOLs, and all of the acquired federal and state credit
carryforwards due to certain tax restrictions placed on Virent’s carryovers after the change in control. Further, we continue to have a valuation allowance on
other state credit carryforwards, which after estimating future taxable income in various jurisdictions, we believe will expire unused. The valuation allowance
reduces the beneﬁt of the credit carryforwards to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. The realization of our other deferred tax assets depends
on Tesoro’s ability to generate future taxable income. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize those deferred
tax assets.
We adopted ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016, which resulted in a $16 million reduction in our income tax provision for the year. See Note 1 for further
discussion.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., multiple state jurisdictions, and a few foreign jurisdictions. Our unrecognized tax beneﬁts totaled $182 million
and $181 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $6 million and $5 million each year have been recognized as tax liabilities. Included
in unrecognized tax beneﬁts as of both December 31, 2016 and 2015 are $172 million (net of the tax benefit on state issues), which would reduce the effective
tax rate if recognized.
It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax beneﬁts could decrease by as much as $13 million in the next twelve months, related primarily to state
apportionment matters, none of which is recognized as a liability. We had accrued $2 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for interest and
penalties. We did not recognize an increase or reduction in interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax beneﬁts during the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015, or 2014. For interest and penalties relating to income taxes we recognize accrued interest in net interest and ﬁnancing costs and
penalties in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of consolidated operations. The tax years 2009 forward remain open to examination
by the Federal and State taxing authorities, except for California, which remains open from the year 2006.
