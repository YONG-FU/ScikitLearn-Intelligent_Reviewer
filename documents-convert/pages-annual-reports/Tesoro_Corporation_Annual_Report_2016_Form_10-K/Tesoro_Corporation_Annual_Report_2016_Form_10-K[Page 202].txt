million (or, at the Issuers’ option, any earlier date), the Issuers will make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders of Notes and all holders of other Indebtedness that
is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in this Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of
sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of the principal amount (or accreted value) thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, T LLP or any Restricted Subsidiary
may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari passu
Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and the representative of such
other pari passu Indebtedness will select such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer,
the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.
TLLP will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent
such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conﬂict with the provisions of Sectioniﬂg hereof or this Section 4T0, TLLP will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under Section 3 .09 hereof or this Section 4.170, by virtue of such compliance.

advance or guarantee with, or for the beneﬁt of, any Affiliate of TLLP

obtained in a comparable transaction by TLLP or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person or, if no comparable transaction is available with
which to compare such Afﬁliate Transaction, such Afﬁliate Transaction is otherwise fair to TLLP or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from a ﬁnancial
point of view; and
(2) TLLP delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Afﬁliate Transaction or series of related Afﬁliate Transactions involving aggregate

such Afﬁliate Transaction complies with clause (1) of this Section AIM a) and that such Afﬁliate Transaction has been approved by either the Conﬂicts
Committee of the Board of Directors of the General Partner (so long as the members of the Conﬂicts Committee approving the Afﬁliate Transaction are
disinterested) or a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the General Partner.
(b) The following items will not be deemed to be Afﬁliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of Section 4.ﬂ(,a,) hereof:
(1) reasonable fees and compensation paid to or for the beneﬁt of any employee, ofﬁcer or director of TLLP, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or
the General Partner, and any employment agreement, customary beneﬁt program or arrangement (including vacation plans, health and life insurance

by bylaw, statutory provisions or any of the foregoing agreements, plans or arrangements;
(2) transactions between or among TLLP and/ or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of TLLP) that is an Afﬁliate of TLLP solely because TLLP owns, directly or
through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;
(4) any issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualiﬁed Equity) of TLLP to Aﬁiliates of TLLP;
(5) Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments that do not violate Section 4.07 hereof;
(6) customary compensation, indemniﬁcation and other beneﬁts made available to ofﬁcers, directors or employees of TLLP, a Restricted
