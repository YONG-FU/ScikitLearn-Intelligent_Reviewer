OTHER lNCOMEOther income during 2016 included gains of $15 million related to pipeline tariff refunds received in California, $13 million proceeds
related to an insurance settlement on contaminated crude oil shipment we received in 2013 and $9 million gain related to an adjustment permitted in the
agreement from the 2013 acquisition of the ARCO® brand. In 2015, other income included a gain for an insurance settlement of$11 million related to the
Washington Refinery Fire.
INCOME TAX EXPENSElur income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $427 million in 2016 versus $936 million in 2015. The decreased
income tax expense is attributable to the decrease in earnings before income taxes. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 33.4% and
35.6% during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compared to 2015, the income from non-taxable noncontrolling interests attributable to TLLP was a higher
percentage of earnings before income taxes. The 2016 rate also beneﬁted from a $16 million decrease in expense related to the early adoption of Accounting
Standards Updated ("ASU") 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in Item
8 for additional information on ASU 2016-09.
EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF INCONEErTAngs from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of
tax, were $10 million in 2016, compared to a $4 million loss in 2015. The earnings in 2016 primarily related to proceeds from the calendar year 2015 earn-out
owed to the Company. The loss in 2015 was related to a change in estimate for the regulatory improvements we are required to make.
2015 COMPARED TO 2014
OVERVIEW. Our net earnings in 2015 were $1.7 billion compared with $888 million in 2014 due primarily to the stronger margin environment in our
Reﬁning segment and lower operating expenses. Similarly, EBITDA of $3.6 billion in 2015 increased $1.4 billion, or 61%, from $2.2 billion in 2014 driven by the
margin environment.
GROSS MARGINSOur gross refining margin increased $691 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by a stronger margin environment
across the California and Paciﬁc Northwest regions. The increase in our gross reﬁning margin was driven by an increase of $2.99 in our gross margin per barrel
partially offset by the impact of the work stoppage and three reﬁnery turnarounds on our reﬁnery utilization during 2015 as well as the net lower of cost or
market inventory adjustments of $317 million for 2015 compared to $42 million for 2014. With a continued volatile price environment, the impact of our lower
of cost of market adjustments can vary and may increase in the future. TLLP revenues, net of operating expenses, increased $365 million due to higher
throughput volumes driven by a full year of operating from the Rockies Natural Gas Business (deﬁned in Item 8, Note 2), and additional operations from other
acquired assets as well as continued expansion of its crude oil gathering assets. Our Marketing gross margin increased $296 million primarily driven by favorable
fuel margins and strong demand.
OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES. Operating expenses were largely in line at $2.5 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to declining natural gas costs
and the conversion of company-operated retail sites to MSOs that reduced costs associated with the management of station operations partially offset by
increased expenses from a full year of operations from the Rockies Natural Gas Business. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $194 million to $756
million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with the Rockies Natural Gas Business and new assets placed into
service. Loss on asset disposals and impairments for 2015 include various projects that were discontinued clue to their lack of economic viability given the
current market environment.
INTEREST AND FINANCING COSTS, NIEii'erest and ﬁnancing costs decreased approximately $18 million to $217 million during 2015 from $235 million
during 2014. The decrease consisted primarily of ﬁnancing transactions that occurred in 2014 that did not have a comparable transaction in 2015. These
transactions include a $39 million charge for premiums paid, unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts related to the redemption of the 9.750% Senior
Notes due 2019 and TLLP 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 in 2014 as well as bridge fees in connection with TLLP’s Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition. These
decreases were partially offset by a full year of incremental interest on TLLP’s 5.500% Senior Notes due 2019 and TLLP’s 6.250% Senior Notes due 2022.
OTHER lNCOMEOther income during 2015 included an insurance settlement gain of$11 million related to the Washington Reﬁnery Fire and in 2014
included a refund and settlement from a crude pipeline network rate case settlement of $59 million.
INCOME TAX EXPENSElur income tax expense from continuing operations totaled $936 million in 2015 versus $547 million in 2014 with the increase
attributable to the increase in earnings before income tax. The combined federal and state effective income tax rate was 35.6% and 37.4% during 2015 and
2014, respectively. Compared to 2014, the income from non-taxable noncontrolling interests attributable to TLLP was a higher percentage of earnings before
income taxes.
