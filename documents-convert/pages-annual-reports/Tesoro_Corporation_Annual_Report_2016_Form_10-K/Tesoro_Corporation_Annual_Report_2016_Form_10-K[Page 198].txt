Section 4.09 Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Equity.
(a) TLLP will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, “incu1”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and TLLP
will not issue any Disqualiﬁed Equity and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any Disqualiﬁed Equity; provided, however, that TLLP
and any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and TLLP and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue Disqualiﬁed Equity, if
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for TLLP’s Reference Period immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such
Disqualiﬁed Equity is issued, as the case may be, would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of
the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualiﬁed Equity had been issued, as the case may be, at the
beginning of such Reference Period.
(b) The provisions of Section 4.09(a) hereof will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted
Debt”):
(1) the incurrence by TLLP and any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness pursuant to one or more Credit Facilities in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) (with letters of credit being deemed to have a principal amount equal to the maximum
potential liability of TLLP and its Restricted Subsidiaries thereunder) not to exceed
the greater of (a) $2,100.0 million and (b) the sum of $1,400.0 million and 20.0% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (determined as of the date of
incurrence and after giving effect to the use of proceeds therefrom);
(2) the incurrence by TLLP, Finance Corp. and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Existing Indebtedness;
(3) the incurrence by TLLP, Finance Corp. and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes and the related Note Guarantees to be
issued on the Issue Date;
