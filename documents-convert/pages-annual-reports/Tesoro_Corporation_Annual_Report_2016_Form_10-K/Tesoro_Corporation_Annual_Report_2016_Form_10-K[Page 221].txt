upon the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such
successor Person will succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same eﬁ‘ect as if it had been named herein as a Guarantor. Such successor
Person thereupon may cause to be signed any or all of the Note Guarantees to be endorsed upon all of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall
not have been signed by the Issuers and delivered to the Trustee. All the Note Guarantees so issued will in all respects have the same legal rank and beneﬁt

Guarantees had been issued at the date of the execution hereof.
Except as set forth in Articles 4 and i hereof, and notwithstanding clauses 2(a) and (b) above, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes
will prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Issuers or another Guarantor, or will prevent any sale or conveyance of the property
of a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Issuers or another Guarantor.
