2016 COMPARED TO 2015
OVERVIEW. Our net earnings in 2016 of $860 million decreased from net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2015 primarily due to the weaker margin environment
within our Reﬁning segment. Similarly, EBITDA of $2.4 billion in 2016 declined $1.2 billion, or 33%, from $3.6 billion in 2015 as a result of the weaker margin
environment.
GROSS MARGINS. Our gross refining margin decreased $1.2 billion during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by a weaker margin environment across
all the regions in which we operate. The $4.70 decrease in our gross reﬁning margin per barrel included the beneﬁts of higher throughput in the year due to
continued demand growth and the positive impact of the net lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $359 million reversing in 2016 compared to an
additional charge of $317 million in 2015. With a continued volatile price environment, the impact of our lower of cost of market adjustment can vary and may
increase in the future. TLLP revenues, net of operating expenses, increased $92 million due to higher storage fees as well as terminalling and pipeline
transportation throughput volumes driven by assets acquired in the year and continued organic expansion. Our gross marketing margin decreased $68 million
primarily due to lower fuel margins in 2016 partially offset by increased fuel sales in the year.
OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSGSerating expenses remained relatively ﬂat at $2.5 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. Depreciation and amortization
expenses increased $95 million to $851 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with the Great Northern
Midstream acquisition along with new assets and turnarounds placed into service during the year.
INTEREST AND FINANCING COSTS, NIEII'erest and ﬁnancing costs increased approximately $57 million to $274 million during 2016 from $217 million in
2015. Theincrease was attributable to the write-off of deferred ﬁnancing costs related to revolver amendments, bridge facility fees in anticipation of the
Western Reﬁning acquisition and new debt issuances in the year, primarily the $250 million aggregate principal amount of TLLP’s 6.125% Senior Notes due in
2021 and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of TLLP’s 6.375% Senior Notes due in 2024 issued in May 2016.
