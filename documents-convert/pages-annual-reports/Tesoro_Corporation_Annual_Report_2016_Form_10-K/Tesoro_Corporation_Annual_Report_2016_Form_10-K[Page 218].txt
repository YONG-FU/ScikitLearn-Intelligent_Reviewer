Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of their Boards of Directors authorizing the execution of any such amended or
supplemental indenture, and upon the ﬁling with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and
upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section'lﬂl hereof, the Trustee will join with the Issuers in the execution of such amended or
supplemental indenture unless such amended or supplemental indenture directly affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or
otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but will not be obligated to, enter into such amended or supplemental Indenture.
It is not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
supplement or waiver, but it is sufﬁcient if such consent approves the substance thereof.
After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this ,S,e,c,tion,9,.0,2, becomes effective, the Issuers will mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a
notice brieﬂy describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, will not, however, in any
way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental indenture or waiver. Subject to ,S,e,c,tions,6,.0,4, and 6,01 hereof, the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then-outstanding voting as a single class may waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers
with any provision of this Indenture or the Notes or the Note Guarantees. However, without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement
or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):
(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(2) reduce the principal of or change the ﬁxed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes; provided,
however, that any purchase or repurchase of Notes, including pursuant to Sections A .,1,0, or 4.15, hereof, shall not be deemed a redemption of the Notes;
(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;
(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest or premium on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of
the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration);
(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Notes;
(6) make any change in the provisions of this Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the contractual rights of Holders of outstanding
Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any payments of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, such Holder’s Notes on or after the due
dates expressed in such outstanding Notes (other than as permitted by clause (7) below);
(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by Sections 4.10 or 4.15 hereof);
(8) release any Guarantor with respect to its Note Guarantee of Notes from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or this Indenture, except
in accordance with the terms of this Indenture; or
(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.
Section 9.03 Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.
Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes will be set forth in an amended or supplemental indenture that complies with the TIA as
then in effect.
Section 9.04 Revocation and Eﬁ’ect of Consents.
Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and
every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Note, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written
notice of revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in
accordance with its terms (except as provided in the second succeeding paragraph) and thereafter binds every Holder.
The Issuers may, but shall not be obligated to, ﬁx a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver. If a record date is ﬁxed, then notwithstanding the second to last sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who
were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) and only those Persons, shall be entitled to consent to such amendment or waiver or
revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date.
