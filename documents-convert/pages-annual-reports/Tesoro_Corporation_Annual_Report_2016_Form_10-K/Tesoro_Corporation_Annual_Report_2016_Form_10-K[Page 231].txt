(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 6, at any time prior to May 1, 2019, the Issuers may on any one or more
occasions redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes (including any Additional Notes) issued under this Indenture at a
redemption price of 106.375% of the principal amount with an amount not to exceed
the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an Interest Payment Date that is on or prior to the Redemption Date); provided that at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued under this Indenture (excluding Notes held by TLLP and its Subsidiaries) remains
outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity
Offering.
(0) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 6, at any time prior to May 1, 2019, the Issuers may redeem all or a part of the
Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon
to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, subject to the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment
Date.
For purposes of this Paragraph 6, “Appliiqablej’iremium” means, with respect to any Note on any Redemption Date, the greater of (1) 1.0% of the
principal amount of the Note; and (2) the excess of: (a) the present value at such Redemption Date of (i) the principal amount of the Notes plus (ii) all
required interest payments due on the Note (excluding accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date) through May 1, 2019, computed
using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate as of such Redemption Date plus 50 basis points; over (b) the principal amount of the Note. “TreasuryiRate”
means, as of any Redemption Date, the yield to maturity as of such Redemption Date of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as
compiled and published in the most recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H15 (519) that has become publicly available at least two Business Days prior
to the Redemption Date (or, if such Statistical Release is no longer published, any publicly available source of similar market data)) most nearly equal to the
period from the Redemption Date to May 1, 2019; provided, however, that if the period from the Redemption Date to May 1, 2019, is less than one year, the
weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year will be used.
7. Mandatory Redemption. Neither of the Issuers is required to make mandatory redemption or sinking ﬁind payments with respect to the Notes.
8. Repurchase at the Option of Holder.
(a) If there is a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers will be required to make an offer (a “Change,o,f,C,ontro,Lfoer”) to each Holder to
repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $ 1 ,000 in excess thereof) of each Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes repurchased to, but excluding, the date of purchase, subject to
the rights of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date (the “Change,o,f,C,ontrol,Payment"). Within 30
days following any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuers will mail a notice to each Holder setting forth the procedures governing the Change of
Control Offer as required by the Indenture.
(b) If the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP consummates any Asset Sales, within ﬁve days aﬁer the date on which the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million (or, at the Issuers’ option, any earlier date), the Issuers will commence an offer to all Holders of Notes and all holders
of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or
redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets (an “AssetiSaleiOﬂer’ﬁ pursuant to Section 3.09 of the Indenture to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an oﬁ‘er price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the
principal amount
(or accreted value) thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. To the extent
that the aggregate amount of Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the TLLP (or
such Restricted Subsidiary) may use such deﬁciency for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes
and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Oﬁ‘er exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and the
representative of such other pari passu Indebtedness will select such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Holders of Notes that
are the subject of an oﬁ‘er to purchase will receive an Asset Sale Offer from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date and may elect to have such Notes
purchased by completing the form entitled “Qpﬁon of Holder to Elect Purchase” attached to the Notes.
9. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder
whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the
notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction or discharge of the Indenture. Notes in denominations larger than $2,000 may
be redeemed in part but only in whole multiples of $ 1 ,000 and in excess of $2,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder are to be redeemed.
