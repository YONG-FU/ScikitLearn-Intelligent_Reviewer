DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
THRIFT PLANWe sponsor an employee thrift 401(k) plan (the "Thrift Plan”) that provides for contributions, subject to certain limitations, by eligible
employees into designated investment funds with a matching contribution by Tesoro. Employees may elect tax-deferred or Roth treatment in accordance with
the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. We match 100% of employee contributions, up to 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation
(subject to applicable union collective bargaining agreements).
We began a proﬁt-sharing contribution to the Thrift Plan effective January 1, 2013. This discretionary contribution, calculated as a percentage of
employee’s base pay based on a pre-determined target for the calendar year, can range from 0% to 4% based on actual performance. Contributions will normally
be made following the performance year. All employees eligible for the Thrift Plan who are employed on December 31$t of the year the results are achieved are
qualiﬁed to receive this contribution, even if they are not contributing to the Thrift Plan. Our contributions to the Thrift Plan amounted to $60 million, $57
million and $42 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $24 million were discretionary contributions accrued under the proﬁt-sharing program
for 2015 for payment in February 2016. There were no discretionary contributions accrued under the proﬁt-sharing program for 2016. Until September 2015,
we sponsored a separate 401(k) savings plan for eligible retail store employees who met the plan’s eligibility requirements (the "Retail Savings Plan”). Eligible
employees automatically received a non-elective employer contribution equal to 3% of eligible earnings, regardless of participation. On September 28, 2015, the
remaining assets in the Retail Savings Plan were merged into the Thrift Plan.
EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
We also sponsor a non-qualiﬁed executive deferred compensation plan, which provides eligible employees the opportunity for additional pre-tax deferrals
and company contributions not provided under our Thrift Plan due to compensation and deferral limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
NOTE 15 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
OPERATING LEASES, PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
We have various cancellable and noncancellable operating leases related to land, office and retail facilities, ship charters, tanks and equipment and other
facilities used in the storage, transportation, and sale of crude oil, feedstocks and refined products. Rental expense for all operating leases, gross of sublease
income, including leases with a term of one month or less, was $576 million in 2016, $569 million in 2015 and $466 million in 2014.
The majority of our future operating lease payments relate to marine transportation, retail station and tank storage leases. As of December 31, 2016, we had
14 ships on time charter used to transport crude oil and reﬁned products. These ships have remaining time charters expiring between 2017 and 2021, with
options to renew. We also time charter tugs and product barges over varying terms ending in 2017 through 2018, most with options to renew and some with
rate escalation clauses. Our time charters contain initial terms up to five years. We have operating leases for most of our retail stations with primary remaining
terms up to 37 years, most of which contain renewal options and escalation clauses. Our storage tank leases run primarily through 2017.
Tesoro’s contractual purchase commitments consist primarily of crude oil supply contracts for our refineries from several suppliers with noncancellable
remaining terms ranging up to five years with renewal provisions. In addition to these purchase commitments, we also have minimum contractual capital
spending commitments totaling approximately $459 million in 2017.
We have certain commitments or obligations for the transportation of crude oil reﬁned products and NGLs as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical
processing services and utilities associated with the operation of our reﬁneries. The minimum commitments extend as many as 10 years. We recognized expense
of approximately $620 million, $687 million and $666 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, under these take-or-pay contracts.
