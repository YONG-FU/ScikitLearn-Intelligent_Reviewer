(a) Includes operating leases having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year.
(b) Prices under the term agreements ﬂuctuate due to market-responsive and other contract-speciﬁc pricing provisions. To estimate our annual commitments under
these contracts, we estimated crude oil prices using exchange-traded crude future prices by crude oil type as of December 31, 2016, with prices ranging from $56
per barrel to $57 per barrel, and volumes based on the contract’s minimum purchase requirements over the term of the contract.
ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES
We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental remediation liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or
operated reﬁning, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based
on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated. Additionally, we have recognized environmental remediation liabilities assumed in past
acquisitions from the prior owners that include amounts estimated for site cleanup and monitoring activities arising from operations at reﬁneries, certain
terminals and pipelines, and retail stations prior to the dates of our acquisitions. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering
assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available.

(a) Includes $22 million and $33 million of TLLP environmental liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our environmental liabilities include $170 million and $192 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to amounts estimated for site
cleanup activities arising from operations at our Martinez reﬁnery and operations of assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition prior to their respective
acquisition dates. We are at various stages of remediation with respect to these assumed liabilities, which may require additional amounts to be recognized for
remediation as more information becomes available in the future or changes in scope occur. The amounts recognized to date reflect management’s best estimate
of amounts determined to be estimable based on facts known at this time. Future changes in amounts recognized for these assumed liabilities may have a
material impact on our results of operations. Of the $170 million accrued at December 31, 2016, approximately $36 million is subject to a cost-share agreement
for the Martinez refinery where we are responsible for 75% of the expenditures.
Our estimates for site cleanup activities reﬂect amounts for which we are responsible under applicable cost-sharing arrangements. On July 10, 2015, a
federal court issued an order denying coverage pursuant to insurance policies for environmental remediation liabilities at our Martinez reﬁnery and those
liabilities are included in our accruals above. The insurer had filed a
