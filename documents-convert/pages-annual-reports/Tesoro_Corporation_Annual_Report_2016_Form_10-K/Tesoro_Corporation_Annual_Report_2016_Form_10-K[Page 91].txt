(a) Certain of our derivative contracts, under master netting arrangements, include both asset and liability positions. We offset both the fair value amounts and any
related cash collateral amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when there is a legally enforceable right and
an intention to settle net or simultaneously. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had provided cash collateral amounts of $88 million and $12
million, respectively, related to our unrealized derivative positions. Cash collateral amounts are netted with mark-to-market derivative assets.
We believe the carrying value of our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and certain accrued
liabilities approximate fair value. Our fair value assessment incorporates a variety of considerations, including the short-term duration of the instruments and the
expected future insigniﬁcance of bad debt expense, which includes an evaluation of counterparty credit risk. The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility,
the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, TLLP Unsecured Term Loan Facility and our Term Loan Credit Facility, which include variable interest rates, approximate fair
value. The fair value of our ﬁxed rate debt is based on prices from recent trade activity and is categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying and
fair values of our debt were approximately $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2016, respectively, and approximately $4.1 billion for both the carrying
and fair values at December 31, 2015. These carrying and fair values of our debt do not consider the unamortized issuance costs, which are netted against our
total debt.
