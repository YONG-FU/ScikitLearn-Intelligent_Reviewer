SHARE REPURCHASES
We are authorized by the Board of Directors (our ”Board”) to purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions at our discretion. The
Board’s authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Purchases of our common stock can also be made to offset the
dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards and to meet our obligations under employee beneﬁt and compensation plans, including the exercise of stock
options and vesting of restricted stock and to fulﬁll other stock compensation requirements. The current program initially authorized $1.0 billion in share
repurchases. In October 2015, the Board authorized an additional $1.0 billion in share repurchases that became effective upon the full completion of the initial
program. On November 16, 2016, the Board approved a further $1.0 billion of share repurchases. We purchased approximately 3.2 million and 6.9 million
shares of our common stock in each year for approximately $250 million and $644 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
PREFERRED STOCK
We have 5.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized with no par value per share. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding as of December 31,
2016 and 2015.

NOTE 17 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
We issue stock-based awards as described below to employees under the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2011 Plan”). We also have outstanding awards
under our 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2006 Plan”), Amended and Restated Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan and Non-Employee Director Stock Plan.
Tesoro had 3,073,672 shares available for future grants under our plans at December 31, 2016, assuming a 200% payout of performance-based awards. Usually,
when stock options are exercised or when restricted common stock is granted, we issue new shares rather than issuing treasury shares. Our plans are described
below.
