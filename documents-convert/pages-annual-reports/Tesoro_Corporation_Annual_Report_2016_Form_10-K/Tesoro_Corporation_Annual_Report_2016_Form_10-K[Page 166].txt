“Attn'bytableiﬂebt” in respect of a sale-and-leaseback transaction means, at the time of determination, the present value (discounted at the interest rate
borne by the Notes, compounded annually) of the obligation of the lessee for net rental payments during the remaining term of the lease included in such
sale-and-leaseback transaction including any period for which such lease has been extended or may, at the option of the lessor, be extended. As used in the
preceding sentence, “net rental payments” under any lease for any such period shall mean the sum of rental and other payments required to be paid with
respect to such period by the lessee thereunder, excluding any amounts required to be paid by such lessee on account of maintenance and repairs, insurance,
taxes, assessments, water rates, utilities, operating and labor costs and other items that do not constitute payment for property rights. In the case of any lease
that is terminable by the lessee upon payment of penalty, such net rental payment shall also include the amount of such penalty, but no rent shall be
considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to the ﬁrst date upon which it may be so terminated.
“Alaiilableicash” has the meaning assigned to such term in the Partnership Agreement, as in effect on the Issue Date.
