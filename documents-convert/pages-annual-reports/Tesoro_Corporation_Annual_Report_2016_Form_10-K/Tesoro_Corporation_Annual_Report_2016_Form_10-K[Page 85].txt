(a) In connection with the Rockies Natural Gas Business acquisition in 2014, TLLP recognized $1.0 billion of business relationships associated with the acquired natural
gas processing and gathering operations. The value for the identiﬁed business relationships consists of cash ﬂows expected from existing contracts and future
arrangements from the existing customer base. The amounts and useful lives associated with these business relationships were ﬁnalized within TLLP’s
measurement period of the purchase price allocation. In addition, during 2016, we recognized S44 million and $19 million of business relationships associated with
the FHR and Great Northern Midstream acquisitions, respectively.
All of our acquired intangible assets are subject to amortization with the exception of certain indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets totaling $62 million and $14
million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets relate to the ARCO® brand included in the trade names category
and perpetual emission credits within the reﬁning operating permits, emissions credits and other category. Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets
was $63 million, S43 million and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated
amortization expense is expected to be $46 million for 2017 and $45 million for each of the next four years thereafter. In accordance with our policies, we
performed an impairment assessment on our indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets and no impairments were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014.
GOODWILL
Goodwill in our Refining segment was $47 million and $31 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reﬂecting acquisitions in the year. See Note
2 for further details regarding our acquisitions. TLLP’s goodwill was $117 million and $130 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reﬂecting the
deconsolidation of RGS. In our Marketing segment, goodwill was $26 million and $27 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For 2016, we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment using a two-step quantitative assessment process on TLLP’s goodwill and the qualitative
assessment process on our Reﬁning segment’s goodwill and our Marketing segment’s goodwill. Factors utilized in the qualitative assessments performed on
goodwill in our Reﬁning and Marketing segments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors,
overall financial performance, company specific operating results and other relevant entity-specific events affecting individual reporting units.
As part of our two-step quantitative goodwill impairment process for TLLP, we engaged a third party appraisal ﬁrm to assist in the determination of
estimated fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value of each TLLP reporting unit using both the income and market
approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results,
economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data
from within a comparable industry grouping. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make signiﬁcant estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums
appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, the discount rates, terminal growth rates, and forecasts of revenue, operating income,
depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures.
