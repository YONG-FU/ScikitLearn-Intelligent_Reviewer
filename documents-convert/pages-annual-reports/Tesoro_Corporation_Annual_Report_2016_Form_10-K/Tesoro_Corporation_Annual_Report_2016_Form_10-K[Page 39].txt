MID-CONTINENT. Average Mid-Continent crack spreads were down approximately 10.9% in 2016 compared to 2015 but were up approximately 10.2% in
2015 versus 2014. Margins and differentials both decreased in 2016 over 2015 resulting in lower gross reﬁning margin. The region had experienced strong
growth driven by crude oil drilling in recent years, but 2016 experienced lower crude oil prices and signiﬁcantly reduced drilling activities which lowered crude
oil supply, which led to decreasing differentials, and lowered product demand, which reduced margins. The WTI to Bakken differential decreased approximately
$0.91 per barrel, increasing the price of Bakken, which resulted in a lower gross margin in 2016 compared to 2015. Bakken crude oil represented about 57% of
the crude oil consumed by our Mid-Continent system in 2016.
OPERATIONAL DATA AND RESULWLanagement uses various operating metrics to evaluate performance and efficiency and to compare proﬁtability to
other companies in the industry. These measures include:
0 Gross reﬁning margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross reﬁning margin (revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased reﬁned products,
transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput; and
0 Manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense ("Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel is calculated by dividing Manufacturing Costs by
total refining throughput.
Investors and analysts use these ﬁnancial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These
ﬁnancial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of
financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
