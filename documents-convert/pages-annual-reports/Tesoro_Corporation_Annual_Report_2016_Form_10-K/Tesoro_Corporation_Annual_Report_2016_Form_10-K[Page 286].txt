as they continue to constitute Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the preceding, any Guarantee of a Restricted Subsidiary that was incurred pursuant
to this Section 4.;6, will be released in accordance with Section 10.06 hereof.
Section 4.17 Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries.
The Board of Directors of the General Partner may designate any Subsidiary of TLLP to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not
cause a Default. If a Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by TLLP
and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of the
designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under Section 4.07 hereof or under one or more clauses of the deﬁnition of
“Permitted Investments”, as determined by TLLP; provided that any designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and
if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the deﬁnition of an “Unrestricted Subsidiary”.
Any designation of a Subsidiary of TLLP as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the Trustee by ﬁling with the Trustee a certiﬁed copy of a
resolution of the Board of Directors of the General Partner giving effect to such designation and an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate certifying that such designation
complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by Section 4.07, hereof. If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the
preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of this Indenture and any
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted
to be incurred as of such date under Section 4.09 hereof, TLLP will be in default of such covenant. The Board of Directors of the General Partner may at any
time designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be
permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under Section 4.09 hereof, calculated on a pro forma basis and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in
existence following such designation.
Section 4.18 Covenant Termination.
Ifat any time (a) the Notes are assigned an Investment Grade Rating from either Moody’s or S&P, (b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing under this Indenture and (c) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate certifying as to matters speciﬁed in clauses (a) and
(b) of this sentence as of the date of such certiﬁcate (the “TerminationDateU, TLLP and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be subject to the provisions
of Sections A .01, 4.08, 4.02, iLQ, iﬂ, $176, and i .DICaX i), of this Indenture.
No Subsidiary shall be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Termination Date.
