DISGUSSION mm ]
In response to incidents in February and March 2014 at our Martinez reﬁnery involving sulfuric acid exposure at the Alkylation Unit, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is conducting an investigation to evaluate the Martinez reﬁnery’s compliance with certain federal environmental acts and the Risk
Management Plan requirements under the Clean Air Act. While we cannot currently predict the timing and the resolution of this investigation, we believe the
outcome will not have a material impact on our liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.
TAX. We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws
and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on
our tax matters.
LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS
During the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our reﬁneries along with
other debt service and lease arrangements (see Notes 12 and 15 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements in Item 8 for additional information). We also have
minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual
obligations to TLLP under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.

(a) Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments
due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings. Interest payments assume the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2016.
(b) Capital lease obligations include amounts classiﬁed as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease
commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not
reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.
(c) Represents an estimate of our long-term contractual purchase commitments for crude oil, having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year. At December 31,
2016, these agreements have remaining terms ranging from one month to six years. Prices under these term agreements ﬂuctuate due to market-responsive
pricing provisions. To estimate our annual commitments under these contracts, we estimated crude oil prices using exchange-traded crude future prices by crude
oil type as of December 31, 2016, with prices ranging from $56 per barrel to $57 per barrel, and volumes based on the contract’s minimum purchase requirements
over the term of the contract. We also purchase additional crude oil under short-term renewable contracts and in the spot market, which are not included in the
table above.
(cl) Represents long-term commitments primarily for the transportation of crude oil, reﬁned products and NGLs as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical
processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.
(e) Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.
We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our deﬁned beneﬁt plans and other postretirement beneﬁts, environmental liabilities and asset
retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classiﬁed as current, there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash ﬂows related to these obligations.
As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other
postretirement beneﬁts, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Notes 14 and 15, respectively, to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
Item 8.
In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash ﬂows with our unrecognized tax beneﬁts, with the exception of amounts classiﬁed as current,
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table S6 million of unrecognized
tax beneﬁts recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Related to these unrecognized tax beneﬁts, and also excluded from the table, is a liability
for potential interest and penalties of $2 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.
