are to be redeemed or purchased, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if not a multiple of $ 1 ,000, shall be redeemed or
purchased. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption or purchase also apply to
portions of Notes called for redemption or purchase.
Section 3.03 Notice of Redemption.
Subject to the provisions of Sectioniﬁg hereof, at least 15 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption Date, the Issuers will mail or cause to
be mailed, by ﬁrst class mail, a notice of redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices
may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a Redemption Date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture pursuant to Articles,8, or_1_1_ hereof. Notice of any redemption of the Notes, (including upon an Equity Offering or in connection
with a transaction (or series of related transactions) that constitute a Change of Control) may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be given prior to the completion
thereof and be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of the related Equity Offering or Change of Control. In
addition, if such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuers’ discretion, the
Redemption Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was delivered) as any or all such
conditions shall be satisﬁed, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisﬁed by the Redemption Date, or by the Redemption Date so delayed, or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Issuers’ discretion if in the
good faith judgment of the Issuers any or all of such conditions will not be satisﬁed. In addition, the Issuers may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Issuers’ obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.
The notice will identify the Notes to be redeemed and will state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the redemption price, if then determinable, and, if not, then a method for determination;
(3) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the Redemption Date
upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion will be issued upon cancellation of the original
Note;
(4) the name and address of the Paying Agent;
(5) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;
(6) that, unless the Issuers default in making such redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the
Redemption Date;
(7) the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and
(8) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes.
At the Issuers’ request, the Trustee will give the notice of redemption in the Issuers’ names and at their expense; provided, however, that the Issuers
have delivered to the Trustee, at least 20 days prior to the Redemption Date (or such shorter time period as the Trustee may agree), an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate
requesting that the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.
Section 3.04 Eﬁ’ect of Notice of Redemption.
Once notice of redemption is delivered in accordance with S,e,c,tion,3,.0,3, hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on
the Redemption Date at the redemption price, unless the redemption is subject to a condition precedent that is not satisﬁed or waived.
