LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF INCOMlldiAKs from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of tax, were $4
million in 2015, compared to $29 million in 2014. The loss in 2014 primarily related to $42 million in charges related to regulatory improvements we are
obligated to make at the Hawaii reﬁnery to resolve the Clean Air Act matters discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements in Item 8. The loss in
2015 is related to a change in estimate for the regulatory improvements we are required to make.

We currently own and operate seven petroleum reﬁneries located in the western United States and sell transportation fuels to a wide variety of customers.
Our reﬁneries produce the majority of the transportation fuels that we sell. Our seven reﬁneries have a combined crude oil capacity of 895 Mbpd. We purchase
crude oil and other feedstocks from domestic and foreign sources, including the Middle East, South America, western Africa, Canada, and other locations either
in the spot market or through term agreements with renewal provisions. Our Marketing segment, including its branded retail network, provides a committed
outlet for the majority of the gasoline produced by our reﬁneries; however, we also sell gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oils and
residual products in bulk and opportunistically export refined products to certain foreign markets.

(a) Tesoro had a total reﬁning capacity of 895 Mbpd in 2016 following the acquisition of the Dickinson reﬁnery in June, in line with our acquisition oriented growth
strategy. In December 2015, we updated our capacity to 875 Mbpd after the completion of several key capital projects. For purposes of the utilization calculation
above, a total refining capacity of 850 Mbpd was used for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
MARKET OVERVIEW. Results from our Reﬁning segment are highly volatile and subject to many factors that are beyond our control. Revenue is not a good
proxy for ﬁnancial performance as the key driver of revenue is the underlying price per barrel of crude oil. Gross reﬁning margin, reﬁnery throughputs, crack
spreads and crude oil differentials are better metrics to measure the performance of the Refining segment.
The gross reﬁning margin is the difference between the prices of all manufactured reﬁned products sold and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks used
to produce reﬁned products, including the cost of transportation and distribution paid to TLLP and third parties at contractual rates. The market for crude oil
and products is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand balance. Product values and crude oil prices are set by the market and are
outside of our control. When evaluating the markets in which we operate, we utilize the US. Energy Information Administration and other industry sources, to
gather supply, demand, utilization, import and export information to forecast and monitor market conditions for our operating
