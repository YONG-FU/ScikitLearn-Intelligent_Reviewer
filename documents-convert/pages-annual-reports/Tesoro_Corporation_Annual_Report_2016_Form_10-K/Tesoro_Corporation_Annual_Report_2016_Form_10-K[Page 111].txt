PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS
PERFORMANCE CONDITION/Se last granted performance condition performance share awards under the 2011 Plan in February 2014 and have not
granted any since. A performance share award represents the right to receive shares of Tesoro common stock at the end of a 3-year performance period
depending on the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance measures. The performance share awards can range from 0% to 200% of the number
of original shares granted. The value of the award ultimately paid will be based on return on capital employed, which is measured against the performance peer
group over the performance period. The fair value of performance share awards tied to performance measures is estimated using the market price of our
common stock on the grant date. The estimated fair value of these performance share awards is amortized over a 3-year vesting period using the straight-line
method.
MARKET CONDITIONWe granted market condition performance share awards under the 2011 Plan in February 2015 and January 2016. A market

achievement of pre-established market conditions. The market condition awards can range from 0% to 200% of the number of original shares granted. The value
of the award ultimately paid will be based on relative total shareholder return, which is measured against the performance peer group, XLE Energy Index and the
S&P 500 Index over the performance period. The estimated fair value for performance share awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the
grant date and the related expense is amortized over a 3-year vesting period using the straight-line method.
