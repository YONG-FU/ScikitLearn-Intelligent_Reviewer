PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The performance graph below compares the cumulative total return of our common stock to (a) the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Composite
Index and (b) a composite peer group ("Peer Group”) comprised of HollyFrontier Corporation, Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corporation.
The graph below is for the five year period commencing December 31, 2011 and ending December 31, 2016.
We selected the Peer Group to include four domestic refining companies we believe follow a similar business model to ours, including reﬁning, transporting,
storing and marketing transportation fuels and related products. The Peer Group is representative of companies that we internally benchmark against.
