TESORO CORPORATION REVOLVING CREDIT FACIIO'IiYSeptember 30, 2016, we entered into a new senior revolving credit agreement (the "Revolving
Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks and ﬁnancial institutions that provides for a total available revolving capacity of $2.0 billion. The credit availability
is not subject to borrowing base redetermination and is scheduled to mature on September 30, 2020. Once certain conditions are satisﬁed, the Revolving Credit
Agreement allows Tesoro to request an increase in capacity to $2.3 billion prior to an investment grade credit rating from either Moody's Investors Service or
S&P Global Ratings and up to $3.0 billion afterward, subject to receiving increased commitments from lenders. We had unused credit availability of
approximately 100% of the borrowing capacity at December 31, 2016. The Revolving Credit Agreement replaced Tesoro’s Sixth Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement dated January 4, 2013, which was terminated on September 30, 2016.
Borrowings bear interest at either a base rate (3.75% at December 31, 2016), plus the applicable spread, or a Eurodollar rate (0.77% at December 31, 2016
(1M LIBOR)), plus the applicable spread. The applicable spread at December 31, 2016 was 0.75% in the case of the base rate and 1.75% in the case of the
Eurodollar rate but will vary generally based on the credit ratings in effect on Tesoro’s senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long-term debt. The commitment
fee for the unused portion of the facility was 0.30% at December 31, 2016.
On December 13, 2016, in connection with the Merger with Western Reﬁning, Tesoro entered into an amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement (the
"Amendment Agreement”) with the banks which provides for an incremental revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion (the "Incremental
Revolver”) and increases the aggregate commitments from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion. Subject to certain conditions, the Incremental Revolver may be initially
borrowed to fund the potential cash consideration payable in connection with the Company’s acquisition of Western Reﬁning, the repayment and redemption of
certain outstanding indebtedness of Western Reﬁning and its subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the payment of fees and expenses associated with
the foregoing.
Following the initial borrowing of the Incremental Revolver and subject to certain conditions, the Incremental Revolver will convert into a single tranche
with the existing commitments and will be available for working capital and general corporate purposes. Following the conversion of the Incremental Revolver,
the Company will have a single tranche of $3.0 billion of commitments under the Amendment Agreement.
