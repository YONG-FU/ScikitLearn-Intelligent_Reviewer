currency, and such reﬁnancing would cause the applicable US. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such reﬁnancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such reﬁnancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being reﬁnanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of
fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with such reﬁnancing. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
incurred to reﬁnance other Indebtedness, if incurred in a diﬁ‘erent currency from the Indebtedness being reﬁnanced, shall be calculated based on the currency
exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such reﬁnancing.
Section 4.10 Asset Sales.
TLLP will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:
(1) TLLP (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at least equal to the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value
to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale and which shall give effect to the assumption by another Person of any
liabilities as provided for in clause (A) of the following paragraph) of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and
(2) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale (as determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale), together
with all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date (on a cumulative basis) by TLLP or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.
For purposes of the preceding clause (2) of this provision, each of the following shall be deemed to be cash or Cash Equivalents:
(A) any liabilities, as shown on TLLP’s most recent consolidated balance sheet, of TLLP or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent
liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantees) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets
pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases TLLP or such Restricted Subsidiary from ﬁirther liability;
(B) any securities, notes or other obligations received by TLLP or any such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such transaction that within
90 days after the Asset Sale (subject to ordinary settlement periods) are converted by TLLP or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents,
to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;
(C) any stock or assets of the kind referred to in clauses (2) or (4) of the next succeeding paragraph received by TLLP or any such Restricted
Subsidiary in connection with such transaction; and
(D) accounts receivable of a business retained by TLLP or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, following the sale of such
business, provided such accounts receivable (x) are not past due more than 60 days and (y) do not have a payment date greater than 90 days from the
date of the invoices creating such accounts receivable;
provided that any Asset Sale pursuant to a condemnation, appropriation or other similar taking, including by deed in lieu of condemnation, or pursuant to the
foreclosure or other enforcement of a Lien incurred not in violation of Section 4.12 or exercise by the related lienholder of rights with respect thereto,
including by deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, shall not be required to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (1) and (2) of this paragraph.
Within 3 65 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (the “AssetsaleProceedsAppli,catio,n,Perio,d,”), TLLP (or any Restricted
Subsidiary) may apply an amount not to exceed such Net Proceeds at its option to any combination of the following:
(1) to prepay, repay, redeem or repurchase Senior Indebtedness of TLLP and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;
(2) to acquire a controlling interest in another business or all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock or operating line of, another
business, in each case engaged in a Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of TLLP;
(3) to make capital expenditures; or
(4) to acquire other assets that are not classiﬁed as current assets under GAAP and that are used or useﬁll in a Permitted Business;
provided that, in the case of clauses (2), (3) and (4) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date
of such commitment so long as TLLP (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) enters into such commitment with the good faith
expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale Proceeds Application
Period (an "Acceptablejlommitmem") and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days of the expiration of the Asset Sale
Proceeds Application Period (the period from the
