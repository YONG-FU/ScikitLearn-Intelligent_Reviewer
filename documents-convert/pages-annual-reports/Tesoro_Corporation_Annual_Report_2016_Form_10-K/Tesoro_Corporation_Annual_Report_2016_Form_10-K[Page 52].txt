future asset acquisitions including transactions with Tesoro. The terms, covenants and restrictions under this facility are substantially the same with its amended

and equipment and both facilities matureJanuary 29, 2021. In addition, upon an upgrade of TLLP’s corporate family rating to investment grade, certain
covenants and restrictions under each facility will automatically be eliminated or improved. See further discussion in Note 12 to our consolidated ﬁnancial

the year ended December 31, 2016 at an average price of $78.56 per share and 6.9 million shares of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2015

CASH FLOW SUMMARY
Working capital (excluding cash) decreased $270 million in 2016 primarily related to the 4.250% senior notes due 2017 and the timing of our payments for
crude oil and reﬁned product purchases partially offset by a higher inventory balance due to higher crude oil prices and the timing of receivables. Working
capital (excluding cash) increased $191 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily related to the timing of our payments for crude oil and reﬁned product
purchases, which was offset by timing of receivables, and the net decrease in inventories, which included a $359 million net lower of cost or market inventory
adjustment due to the lower price environment we experienced during 2015.
