(a) Federal and state motor fuel taxes on sales by our Marketing segment are included in both revenues and cost of sales in our statements of consolidated
operations. These taxes totaled $577 million, $561 million and $581 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(b) Our Reﬁning segment uses Rle to satisfy its obligations under the Renewable Fuels Standard, in addition to physically blending required biofuels. At the end of
2014, given the price of Rle had become more transparent in the price of biofuels, we determined our intersegment pricing methodology should include the
market value of Rle as a reduction to the price our Marketing segment pays to our Reﬁning segment. We made this change effective January 1, 2015. We have
not adjusted ﬁnancial information presented for our Reﬁning and Marketing segments for the year ended December 31, 2014. Had we made this change effective
January 1, 2014, operating income in our Reﬁning segment would have been reduced by $125 million with a corresponding increase to operating income in our
Marketing segment for the year ended December 31, 2014.
(c) We present TLLP’s segment operating income net of general and administrative expenses totaling $53 million, $54 million and $39 million representing TLLP’s
corporate costs that are not allocated to TLLP’s operating segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
