MARKET STOCK UNITS
We granted market stock units under the 2011 Plan in February 2015 and January 2016. These market stock units represent the right to receive a target
number of shares that will vest at the end of a 3-year performance period. The number of shares ultimately issued will be based on Tesoro’s stock price changes
over the performance period. The market stock units’ potential payout can range from 50% to 200% of the targeted award value, unless the average closing
stock price at vesting has decreased more than 50% from the average closing stock price at the grant date, then no market stock units will be paid out. The fair
value of each market stock unit is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of these market stock units is
amortized over a 3-year vesting period using the straight-line method. The estimated weighted average payout percentage for these awards was 130% as of
December 31, 2016. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested market stock units totaled $39 million as of December 31, 2016, which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 years. The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of market stock units granted
during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $84.84, $114.57 and $57.60, respectively.

Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock. We use historical data to estimate employee termination within the valuation model.
Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The risk-free rate for periods within the performance period is based on the US.
