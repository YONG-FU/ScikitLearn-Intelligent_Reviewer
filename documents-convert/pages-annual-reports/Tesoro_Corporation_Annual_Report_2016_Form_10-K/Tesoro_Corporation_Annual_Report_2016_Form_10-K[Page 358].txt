for the registrant and have:
(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
those entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report is being prepared;
(b) Designed such internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, or caused such internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting to be designed under our

likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a signiﬁcant role in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.
