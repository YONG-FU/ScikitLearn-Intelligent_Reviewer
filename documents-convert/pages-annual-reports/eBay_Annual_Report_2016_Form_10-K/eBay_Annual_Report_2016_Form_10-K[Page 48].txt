Seasonality
We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer
buying patterns and expect that these trends will continue. The following table sets forth, for
the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of
these net revenues (in millions, except percentages):

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Our commerce platforms operate globally, resulting in certain revenues that are
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Korean won and
Australian dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our
financial results. Because of this and the fact that we generated a majority of our net revenues
internationally during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we are subject to the
risks related to doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “Part I — Item 1A — Risk
Factors.”
In addition to the corresponding measures under generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”), management uses non—GAAP measures in reviewing our financial results.
The foreign exchange (“FX-Neutral”), or constant currency, net revenue amounts discussed
below are non—GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,
measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the FX—Neutral information
appearing in the following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction
with the information provided in “Non—GAAP Measure of Financial Performance,” which
includes reconciliations of FX-Neutral financial measures to the most directly comparable
GAAP measures. We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements
using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency
amounts.
The effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2016 was due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the British pound, Korean
won, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar.
Fiscal Year Highlights
Net revenues increased 5% to $9.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by
StubHub net transaction revenues and marketing, services and other revenues, partially offset
by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.
FX-Neutral net revenues increased 7% in 2016 compared to 2015.
