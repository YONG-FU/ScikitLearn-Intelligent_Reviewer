Interest and Other, Net
Interest and other, net primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and
investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our portion of operating
results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment
gain/loss on acquisitions or disposals and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on
any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit
agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if
any. The following table presents interest and other, net (in millions, except percentages):

The increase in interest and other, net in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the
$1.3 billion pre—tax gain from the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc., and our
hedging strategy, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of
senior notes during the first quarter of 2016. The increase in interest and other, net in 2015
compared to 2014 was primarily due to gains on sale of investments, partially offset by an
increase in interest expense due to the issuance of debt securities in 2014 and a decrease in
interest income attributable to the lower overall balance of cash, short—term investments and
long-term investments after the Distribution.

Effective tax rate (99.5)% 19.1% 134.4%
Our effective tax rate was (99.5)% in 2016 compared to 19.1% in 2015. The decrease in our
effective tax rate during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the recognition in 2016 of
deferred tax assets of approximately $4.6 billion as a result of the realignment of our legal
structure and the associated tax agreements. This was partially off—set by the $485 million tax
effect on the $1.3 billion gain on the sale of our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc.
Our effective tax rate was 19% in 2015 compared to 134% in 2014. The decrease in our
effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due to the recognition in 2014 of deferred
tax liabilities of approximately $3.0 billion of U.S. income and applicable foreign withholding
taxes on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for
2013 and prior years. This was partially offset by the tax effect of gains on sale of certain
investments in 2015.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we began the process of realigning our legal structure,
subsequent to the distribution of PayPal Holdings, Inc., to better reflect how we manage and
