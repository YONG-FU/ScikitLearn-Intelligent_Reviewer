NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
The following table reflects changes in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended
December 31, 2016,2015 and 2014 (in millions):
2016 2015 2014
Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the beginning of
the period $440 $367 $304
Increases related to prior period tax positions 24 36 35
j Decreases related to prior period tax positions (20) (8) (18)j
Increases related to current period tax positions 47 51 59
j Settlements (33) (e) (13)j
Gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of the
period $458 $440 $367
Included within our gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits of $458 million as of
December 31, 2016 is $107 million of unrecognized tax benefits indemnified by PayPal. If the
remaining balance of unrecognized tax benefits were realized in a future period, it would result in
a tax benefit of $385 million. Of this amount, approximately $98 million of unrecognized tax
benefit is indemnified by PayPal and a corresponding receivable would be reduced upon a future
realization. As of December 31, 2016, our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were included in
accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred and other tax liabilities, net.
We recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense. In 2016, $6 million was included in tax expense for interest and penalties. The amount
of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately
$54 million and $61 million, respectively.
We are subject to both direct and indirect taxation in the U.S. and various states and foreign
jurisdictions. We are under examination by certain tax authorities for the 2003 to 2013 tax years.
We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately
result from these or other examinations. The material jurisdictions where we are subject to
potential examination by tax authorities for tax years after 2002 include, among others, the
U.S. (Federal and California), Germany, Korea, Israel, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Canada.
Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is
reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly
change in the next 12 months. However, given the number of years remaining subject to
examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the full
range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.
On July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the US. Tax Court issued an opinion
invalidating the regulations relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in
an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was issued by the Tax Court in
December 2015. The IRS is appealing the decision and filed its arguments opposing the Tax
Court decision in June 2016. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current
regulations, questions related to the scope of potential benefits or obligations, and the risk of
the Tax Court’s decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any benefit or
expense as of December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor ongoing developments and
potential impacts to our consolidated financial statements.
