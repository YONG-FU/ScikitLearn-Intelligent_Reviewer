combination, insurance settlement proceeds, and distributions from certain equity method
investees. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017. While we continue to assess the potential impact of
this standard, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires the recognition of the income tax
consequences of an intra—entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer
occurs. This removes the exception to postpone recognition until the asset has been sold to
an outside party. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods,
with early adoption is permitted. It is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis
through a cumulative—effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal
year of adoption. We are evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on
our consolidated financial statements.
