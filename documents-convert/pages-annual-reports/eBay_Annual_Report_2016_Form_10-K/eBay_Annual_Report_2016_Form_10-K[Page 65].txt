Commitments ano/ Contingencies
We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future
estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs,
contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in
actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the
timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our fixed contractual
obligations and commitments (in millions):

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above
table are as follows:
- Debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt
instruments. For additional details related to our debt, please see “Note 11 — Debt” to
the consolidated financial statements included in this report. This table does not
reflect any amounts payable under our $2 billion revolving credit facility or $1.5 billion
commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of
December 31, 2016.
- Lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non—cancelable operating
leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well as computer and office
equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. The amounts presented are
consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from
actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount
needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.
- Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for
advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications,
engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and
services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to
unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $436 million of such non-current
liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had assets classified as cash and
cash equivalents, as well as short—term and long-term non—equity investments, in an aggregate
amount of $11.0 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, this amount
included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $8.2 billion. Of
