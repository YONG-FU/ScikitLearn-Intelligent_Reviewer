to cash paid for investments of $11.2 billion, property and equipment of $626 million and net
cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $212 million, partially offset by proceeds of
$10.1 billion from the maturities and sales of investments.
The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $673 million in 2015 was due
primarily to cash paid for purchases of investments of $6.7 billion, purchases of property and
equipment of $668 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $24 million,

The net cash used in continuing investing activities of $1.3 billion in 2014 was due primarily
to cash paid for purchases of investments of $8.8 billion, purchases of property and
equipment of $622 million and net cash paid for acquisition of businesses of $55 million,

The largely offsetting effects of purchases of investments and maturities and sale of
investments results from the management of our investments. As our immediate cash needs
change, purchase and sale activity will fluctuate.
Continuing Financing Activities
The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $744 million in 2016 was primarily
due to $2.9 billion of cash paid to repurchase common stock, partially offset by $2.2 billion of
proceeds from debt issuances.
The net cash used in continuing financing activities of $3.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily
to cash outflows from $2.1 billion to repurchase common stock, $850 million payment of debt
upon maturity and cash paid for tax withholdings in the amount of $245 million related to net
share settlements of restricted stock units and awards. These cash outflows were partially
offset by cash inflows of $221 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with
the exercise of stock options and the effect of $74 million of excess tax benefits from stock-
based compensation.
