Operating expenses, net of $3 million from hedging activities, were favorably impacted
by $66 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2016 compared
to 2015. Operating expenses, net of $47 million from hedging activities, were favorably
impacted by $194 million due to foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar in 2015
compared to 2014.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs and marketing
programs (both online and offline), employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs
and depreciation on equipment. Online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs
in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. Offline
advertising includes primarily brand campaigns and buyer/seller communications.
The increase in sales and marketing expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due
to an increase in marketing program costs (both online and offline programs) partially offset by
a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The decrease
in sales and marketing expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a favorable
impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar, a decrease in marketing
program costs due in part to a shift in certain buyer and seller incentives (for which associated
expenses are recorded as a reduction in revenue instead of sales and marketing expense) and
employee-related savings from our global workforce reduction.
Product Development
Product development expenses primarily consist of employee compensation, contractor
costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. Product development expenses are net
of required capitalization of major platform and other product development efforts, including
the development of our platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, and seller tools.
Our top technology priorities include structured data, multi-screen capabilities, improved
seller tools and buyer experiences.
Capitalized internal use and platform development costs were $137 million and $136 million
in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when
amortized in future periods.
