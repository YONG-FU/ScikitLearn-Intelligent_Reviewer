$4.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing 54%, 55% and 57% of total net
transaction revenues in the respective periods. The decrease in net transaction revenues
earned internationally as a percentage of total net transaction revenue in 2016 compared to

currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar.
