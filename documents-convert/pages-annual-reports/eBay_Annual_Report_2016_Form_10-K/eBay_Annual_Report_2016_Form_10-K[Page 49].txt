In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $4.6 billion as a result of the
initial stages of realigning our legal structure and the associated tax rulings. In addition, we
sold our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. for net proceeds of $1.3 billion. The pre-tax gain
of $1.3 billion was recorded in interest and other, net on our consolidated statement of income.
Operating margin increased to 25.9% in 2016 compared to 25.6% in 2015. Diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations increased to $6.37 for 2016 compared to $1.60 for 2015.
In addition, we generated cash flow from continuing operating activities of $2.8 billion in 2016
compared to $2.9 billion in 2015.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net Revenues
We generate two types of net revenues: net transaction revenues and marketing services
and other (“MS and O”) revenues. Net transaction revenues are derived principally from final
value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub
platforms), listing fees and other service fees. M880 revenues consists of Marketplace,
StubHub and Classifieds revenue principally from the sale of advertisements, vehicles
classifieds listing on Marketplace platforms, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees,
marketing service fees and lead referral fees. Revenues are attributed to U.S. and international
geographies primarily based upon the country in which the seller, platform that displays
advertising, other service provider or customer, as the case may be, is located. To drive traffic
to our platforms, we provide incentives to our users in the form of coupons and buyer and
seller rewards. These incentives are generally treated as reductions in revenue.
