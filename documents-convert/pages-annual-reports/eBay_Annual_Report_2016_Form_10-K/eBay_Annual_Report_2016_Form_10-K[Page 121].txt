As of December 31, 2016, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for
income tax purposes were approximately $22 million, $74 million and $135 million,
respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various
limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state tax laws. If not
utilized, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will both begin to expire in 2018.
The carryforward periods on our foreign net operating loss carryforwards are as follows:
$37 million do not expire, $79 million are subject to valuation allowance and begin to expire in
2023, and $20 million are not subject to valuation allowance but will begin to expire in 2019. As
of December 31, 2016, state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were
approximately $69 million. Most of the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our federal capital loss carryover amounted to zero and
$336 million, respectively. The decrease in the capital loss carryover of $336 million is due to
utilization of the loss carryover against gains primarily from the sale of our equity holdings of
MercadoLibre, Inc, in 2016.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to
certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to operating losses in certain non—U.S.
jurisdictions that we believe are not likely to be realized.
