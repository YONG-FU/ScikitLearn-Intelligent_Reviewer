We have substantial indebtedness, and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness
in the future, and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to service our
indebtedness. Failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the
acceleration of our indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and
liquidity.
We have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial
additional indebtedness in the future, including under our commercial paper program and
revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities. Our
outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant
consequences, including, without limitation, any of the following:
- requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other
available cash to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash
available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;
- our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our
business, to competitive pressures, and to adverse changes in general economic and
industry conditions;
- adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating
agencies will likely increase our borrowing costs;
- our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, share repurchases or other general corporate and other purposes may
be limited; and
- our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry
may be limited.
Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends
upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry
cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of
operations and financial condition, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to
generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be
required to, among other things:
- repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost;
- seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;
- refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;
- sell selected assets; or
- reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.
Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any
such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable
terms or at all.
Our revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding
debt securities were issued contain, and any debt instruments we enter into in the future may
contain, financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict, among other things, our
business and operations. If we fail to pay amounts due under, or breach any of the covenants
in, a debt instrument, then the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate
repayment of all borrowings thereunder (subject in certain cases to grace or cure period).
Moreover, any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of any of our
