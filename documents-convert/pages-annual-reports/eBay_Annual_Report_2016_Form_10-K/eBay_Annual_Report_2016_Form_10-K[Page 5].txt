Focus on Our Strategic Priorities Moving Forward
While eBay will continue to evolve, the central tenets of our strategy are set. Our goal is to
accelerate our execution and innovation as the strategy rolls forward. We have also said that
re-positioning our business will take time and discipline.
We have worked diligently to create a marketplace that is inclusive and fair, fostered by
global trade and empowered by small business entrepreneurship. eBay’s business is strong
and 2016 showed that we are on the right path. Thank you for your continued support.
