Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue 3.6 billion
shares of common stock.
Stock Repurchase Program
In January 2015, our Board authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the
repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock. In June 2015, our Board authorized an
additional $1 billion stock repurchase program and in July 2016, our Board authorized an
additional $2.5 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no
expiration from the date of authorization.
Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of
dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other
factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding
share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made
through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including
accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as
management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing
alternatives. Our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without
prior notice. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of
factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions
and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
Stock repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs during 2016 was as
follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
