Performance Measurement Comparison
The graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return of an investment of $100
(and the reinvestment of any dividends thereafter) on December 31, 2011 (the last trading day
for the year ended December 31, 2011) in (i) our common stock, (ii) the Nasdaq Composite
Index, (iii) the S8P 500 Index and (iv) the S8P Information Technology Index. The SSP
Information Technology Index replaces the 88-P North American Technology Internet Index,
which is no longer tracked by S8P. For the purpose of this graph, the distribution of 100% of the
outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”) to our stockholders, pursuant to
which PayPaI became an independent company, is treated as a non—taxable cash dividend of
$41.46, an amount equal to the opening price of PayPaI common stock on July 20, 2015 which
was deemed reinvested in eBay common stock at the opening price on July 20, 2015.
