Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which could harm our business.
Our international businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and
Korea, and cross-border business from greater China, have generated a majority of our net
revenues in recent years. In addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from
our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing
business internationally, including:
- uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the United
Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union;
- uncertainty regarding how the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union Single
Market and the wider trading, legal, regulatory and labor environments, especially in
the United Kingdom and European Union, will be impacted by the United Kingdom’s
vote to exit the European Union, including the resulting impact on our business and
that of our clients;
- expenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data,
including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and
adapting our products and services to local preferences (e.g., payment methods) with
which we may have limited or no experience;
- trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;
- difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of
varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
- stringent local labor laws and regulations;
- credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
- profit repatriation restrictions, foreign currency exchange restrictions or extreme
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for a particular currency;
- political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;
- geopolitical events, including natural disasters, public health issues, acts of war, and
terrorism;
- import or export regulations;
- compliance with US. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and foreign laws
prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials, as well as US. and foreign laws
designed to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities;
- antitrust and competition regulations;
- potentially adverse tax developments and consequences;
- economic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debt;
- different, uncertain, or more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy, and
other laws;
- risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws;
- national or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rates;
- local licensing and reporting obligations; and
- increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable.
Violations of the complex foreign and US. laws and regulations that apply to our
international operations may result in fines, criminal actions, or sanctions against us, our
