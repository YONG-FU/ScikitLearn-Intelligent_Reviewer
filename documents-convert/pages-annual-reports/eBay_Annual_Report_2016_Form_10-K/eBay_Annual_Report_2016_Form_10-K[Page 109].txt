NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
Senior Notes
In 2016, we issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an aggregate principal
amount of $2.25 billion. The issuance consisted of $750 million aggregate principal amount of
2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.800% fixed
rate notes due 2022 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.000% fixed rate notes
due 2056.
Our floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we
may redeem some or all of the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to
time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the
other fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity,
generally at a make-whole redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of
control triggering event occurs with respect to the 2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, the
3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022 or the 6.000% fixed rate notes due 2056, we must, subject
to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of the applicable series at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the
previous issuance of certain senior notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that
effectively converted $2.4 billion of our fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on LIBOR
plus a spread. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair
value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The gains and
losses related to changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in
the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to changes in
market interest rates.
The effective interest rates for our senior notes include the interest payable, the
amortization of debt issuance costs and the amortization of any original issue discount on
these senior notes. Interest on these senior notes is payable either quarterly or semiannually.
Interest expense associated with these senior notes, including amortization of debt issuance
costs, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $254 million
and $178 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of these senior
notes was approximately $8.9 billion.
The indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary
covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume
or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease—back
transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of
default.
Other Indebtedness
Our other indebtedness is comprised of overdraft facilities. We have formal overdraft
facilities in India bearing interest on drawn balances at approximately a 9.1% rate per annum.
