Acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, and strategic investments could result in
operating difficulties and could harm our business.
We have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope,
technologies, services, and products and have in July 2015 distributed 100% of the
outstanding common stock of PayPal to our stockholders, pursuant to which PayPal became
an independent company, and sold our Enterprise business in November 2015. We also expect
to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of
our overall business strategy, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions
of businesses, technologies, services, products, and other assets, as well as strategic
investments and joint ventures.
These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including:
- the potential loss of key customers, merchants, vendors and other key business
partners of the companies we acquire, or dispose of, following and continuing after
announcement of our transaction plans;
- declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies
that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in compensation, or
changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of
the acquired or disposed business;
- difficulty making new and strategic hires of new employees;
- diversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to
the transaction, and in the case of an acquisition, integration and administration;
- the need to provide transition services to a disposed of company, which may result in
the diversion of resources and focus;
- the need to integrate the operations, systems (including accounting, management,
information, human resource and other administrative systems), technologies,
products and personnel of each acquired company, which is an inherently risky and
potentially lengthy and costly process;
- the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or
not implemented, and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a
result;
- the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a
larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition may have lacked such
controls, procedures and policies or whose controls, procedures and policies did not
meet applicable legal and other standards;
- risks associated with our expansion into new international markets;
- derivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or disposition;
- liability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction,
including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, violations of
laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and
unknown liabilities and, in the case of dispositions, liabilities to the acquirors of those
businesses under contractual provisions such as representations, warranties and
indemnities;
- the potential loss of key employees following the transaction;
