Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) for all eligible employees. Under the
plan, shares of our common stock may be purchased over an offering period with a maximum
duration of two years at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day of the
applicable offering period or on the last day of the six—month purchase period. Employees may
purchase shares having a value not exceeding 10% of their eligible compensation during an
offering period. During the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, employees purchased
approximately 4 million, 4 million and 4 million shares under this plan at average prices of
$18.97, $30.83 and $42.06 per share, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, approximately
20 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance.
