(1) In January 2015, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up
to $2 billion of our common stock. In June 2015, our Board authorized an additional $1 billion stock repurchase program and in July
2016, our Board authorized an additional $2.5 billion stock repurchase program. These stock repurchase programs have no
expiration from the date of authorization.
Our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation
programs and subject to market conditions and other factors, to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce
outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market
transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means
at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing
alternatives.
During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our
stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately $1.3 billion remained available for future repurchases
of our common stock under our July 2016 repurchase program.
We expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our common
stock. However, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. The timing and
actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, price
and other market conditions and management’s determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
