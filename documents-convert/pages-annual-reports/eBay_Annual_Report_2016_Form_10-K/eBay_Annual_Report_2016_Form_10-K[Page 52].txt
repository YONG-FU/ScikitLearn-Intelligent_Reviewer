driven by an increase in Sports, Concerts and Theater transactions on our platform, as well as a
higher 8tubHub transaction take rate. The increase in 8tubHub transaction take rate was
primarily due to a change in mix of events and sellers on the 8tubHub platforms. The increase
in 8tubHub net transaction revenue was greater than the increase in 8tubHub GMV due to the
higher 8tubHub transaction take rate.

The increase in total M880 revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily attributable
to an increase in FX-Neutral Classifieds M880 revenues and FX-Neutral Marketplace M880
revenues, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative
to the U8. dollar. The decrease in total M880 revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 was
primarily attributable to an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to
the U8. dollar, partially offset by increased FX—Neutral Classifieds revenue, and to a lesser
extent, increased FX-Neutral revenue from Marketplace marketing services.
Marketplace M880 Revenues
The increase in Marketplace M880 revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily
driven by increased fees earned for referral services and increased revenue from our revenue
share programs, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements
relative to the U8. dollar. The increase in fees earned for referral services primarily consisted
of fees for customers acquired and incentives for the usage of PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal”)
products on certain Marketplace platforms, which were not included in marketing services and
other revenues prior to the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal to
our stockholders (the “Distribution”).
