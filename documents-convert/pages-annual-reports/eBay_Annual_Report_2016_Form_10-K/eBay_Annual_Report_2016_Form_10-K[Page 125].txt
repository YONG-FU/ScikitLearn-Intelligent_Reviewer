Note 18 — Restructuring
There was no restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2016 and a restructuring
reserve of $2 million as of December 31, 2015. Restructuring costs in 2016 were not material.
In January 2015, at a regular meeting of our Board, our Board approved a plan to implement
a strategic reduction of our existing global workforce. As a result, we reduced our workforce
globally, completing the reduction in the first half of 2015. These restructuring costs were
included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.
$62 million of restructuring costs were recognized and $60 million of payments were made
during the year ended December 31,2015.
