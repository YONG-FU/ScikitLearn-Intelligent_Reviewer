Dear Stockholders,
Your Board of Directors remains focused on ensuring eBay operates in a manner that
supports the long—term interests of the stockholders and stakeholders it serves. In the first full
year after completing the spin—off of PayPal, eBay made solid progress on its strategic plan to
reposition the business for the future. Under the leadership of CEO Devin Wenig, the company
began delivering on its commitment to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most
powerful selling platform. The Board believes this strategy will contribute to a more resilient
and differentiated eBay in the years to come.
The Board also believes in taking a disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and
capital allocation. In 2016, the company returned $3.0 billion of capital to you, our valued
stockholders, through repurchases of common stock under Board authorized share
repurchase programs. We also approved and completed the monetization of eBay’s $1.3 billion
stake in MercadoLibre, Inc. as well as completing a number of acquisitions to support our
strategic direction and capabilities.
eBay is deeply committed to being a great and successful company; the ability to deliver
on this commitment is strengthened by eBay’s clear strategic direction, relentless focus on
execution and disciplined financial model. It is also supported by a strong belief in the
transformational power of commerce. Through eBay’s platforms, the company is creating a
better, more sustainable form of commerce that empowers people and creates opportunity.
While there is still much work ahead, the Board is pleased with the progress that eBay has
made over the past year and is excited about the opportunities ahead. On behalf of eBay’s
Board of Directors, I thank you for your support and look forward to continuing to serve you in
2017.
Thomas Tierney
Chairman of the Board
