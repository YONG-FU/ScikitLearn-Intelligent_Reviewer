Under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our derivative
contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are allowed to net settle transactions of the
same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. However, we have
elected to present the derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on our
consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, the potential effect of rights of set-off
associated with the foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and
liabilities by $48 million, resulting in net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities of
$83 million and $1 million, respectively. We are not required to pledge, nor are we entitled to
receive, collateral related to our foreign exchange derivative transactions. As of December 31,
2016, we had neither pledged nor received collateral related to our interest rate derivative
transactions.
