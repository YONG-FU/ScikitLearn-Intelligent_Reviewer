registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder.
Our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the
case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit
agreement.
In the first quarter of 2016, we issued senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an
aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion. This consists of $750 million aggregate principal
amount of 2.500% fixed rate notes due 2018, $750 million aggregate principal amount of
3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.000%
fixed rate notes due 2056.
We previously issued senior notes in underwritten public offerings under prior registration
statements. The senior notes that remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016 consisted of
$450 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2017, $1.0 billion aggregate
principal amount of 1.35% fixed rate notes due 2017, $400 million aggregate principal amount
of floating rate notes due 2019, $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.2% fixed rate notes
due 2019, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% fixed rate notes due 2020,
$750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% fixed rate notes due 2021, $1.0 billion
aggregate principal amount of 2.60% fixed rate notes due 2022, $750 million aggregate
principal amount of 3.45% fixed rate notes due 2024 and $750 million aggregate principal
amount of 4.00% fixed rate notes due 2042.
The net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were used for general corporate
purposes, including, among other things, capital expenditures, share repurchases, repayment
of indebtedness and possible acquisitions.
The floating rate notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. On and after March 1, 2021, we
may redeem some or all of the fixed rate notes due 2056 at any time and from time to time
prior to their maturity, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes
to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of the other
fixed rate notes of each series at any time and from time to time prior to their maturity,
generally at a make-whole redemption price plus accrued and unpaid interest. If a change of
control triggering event (as defined in the applicable notes) occurs with respect to the 2.500%
fixed rate notes due 2018, the 3.800% fixed rate notes due 2022 or the 6.000% fixed rate
notes due 2056, we must, subject to certain exceptions, offer to repurchase all of the notes of
the applicable series at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest.
To help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, we previously entered into
interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of the fixed rate notes to
floating rate debt based on the London lnterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread. These
swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed
rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.
The indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary
covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume
or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and leaseâ€”back
transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of
default.
Other Indebtedness
Our other indebtedness is comprised of overdraft facilities. We have formal overdraft
facilities in India bearing interest on drawn balances at approximately a 9.1% rate per annum.
