Notional Amounts of Derivative Contracts
Derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is
not recorded on the balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure
of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is
used only as the basis on which the value of foreign exchange payments under these
contracts are determined. The following table provides the notional amounts of our
outstanding derivatives as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):
