The following table presents certain key operating metrics that we believe are significant
factors affecting our net transaction revenues (in millions, except percentages):

i Total transaction take rate (4) 8.41% 0.05 % 8.36% (0.07)% 8.43%]
(i) We define Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”) as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our
Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually
consummated the transaction. We believe that GMV provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that
flow through our platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in GMV of closed transactions that are not ultimately
consummated.
(2) We define Marketplace transaction take rate as Marketplace net transaction revenues divided by Marketplace GMV.
(3) We define StubHub transaction take rate as StubHub net transaction revenues divided by StubHub GMV.
(4) We define total transaction take rate as total net transaction revenues divided by GMV.

The increase in net transaction revenues in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by
an increase in StubHub GMV and a higher transaction take rate, partially offset by an
unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar. The total
transaction take rate was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 due to an increase in our StubHub
transaction take rate, partially offset by a decrease in our Marketplace transaction take rate.
The decrease in net transaction revenues in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven
by an unfavorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar and a
lower transaction take rate, partially offset by an increase in FX-Neutral Marketplace GMV, and
to a lesser extent, StubHub GMV. The total transaction take rate was lower in 2015 compared
to 2014 due to a decrease in our Marketplace transaction take rate, partially offset by an
increase in our StubHub transaction take rate.
