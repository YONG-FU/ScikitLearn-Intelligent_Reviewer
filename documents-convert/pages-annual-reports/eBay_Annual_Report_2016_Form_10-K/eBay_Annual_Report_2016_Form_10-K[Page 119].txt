Modifications of Stock-Based Awards
During 2015, in connection with the Distribution, restricted and deferred stock awards and
employee stock option awards were modified and converted into new equity awards using
conversion ratios designed to preserve the value of these awards to the holders immediately
prior to the Distribution. On July 17, 2015, employees holding stock options, restricted stock
awards or units, deferred stock awards, and ESPP awards denominated in pre—Distribution
eBay stock received a number of otherwise-similar awards in post-Distribution eBay stock
and/or PayPal stock based on the conversion ratios outlined for each group of employees in
the Employee Matters Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Distribution.
Adjustments to our outstanding stock based compensation awards, including ESPP awards,
resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $68 million to be recognized
over the remaining vesting life of the underlying awards.
In December 2014, the terms of various stock—based awards held by the Company’s CEO,
CFO, General Counsel, SVP of Human Resources and SVP of Corporate Communications (the
“Departing Executives”) were modified in anticipation of and contingent upon termination of
employment at the time of the Distribution. The modifications for the Departing Executives,
each of whom had his or her employment terminated at the time of the Distribution, provided
for the full acceleration of certain awards and extended the exercise periods of certain awards.
These modifications resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately $37 million
recognized from the modification date in December 2014 through the Distribution on July 17,
2015.
Employee Savings Plan
We have a defined contribution plan, which is qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their eligible
compensation, but not more than statutory limits. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we contributed one
dollar for each dollar a participant contributed, with a maximum contribution of 4% of each
employee’s eligible compensation, subject to a maximum employer contribution of $10,600,
$10,600 and $10,400 per employee for each period, respectively. Our non—U.S. employees are
covered by various other savings plans. Our total expense for these savings plans was
$49> million, $51 million and $43 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
