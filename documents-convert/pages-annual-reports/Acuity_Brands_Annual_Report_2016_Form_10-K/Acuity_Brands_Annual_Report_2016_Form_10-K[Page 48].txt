Through multiple acquisitions, the Company acquired intangible assets consisting primarily of trademarks and
trade names associated with specific products with finite lives, deﬁnite-lived distribution networks, patented technology,
non-compete agreements, and customer relationships, which are amortized overtheir estimated useful lives. Indefinite-
lived intangible assets consist oftrade names that are expected to generate cash ﬂows indefinitely. Signiﬁcant estimates
and assumptions were used to determine the initial fair value of these acquired intangible assets, including estimated
future net sales, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. The current year increase in the gross
carrying amounts for the acquired intangible assets was due primarily to the acquisitions of Distech Controls, Juno
Lighting, Geometri and DGLogik (refer to the Acquisitions and Investments footnote), while decreases were due to the
impairment of an indeﬁnite-lived trade name and foreign currency translation adjustments.
The Company recorded amortization expense of $21.4, $11.0, and $11.2 related to intangible assets with ﬁnite
lives during ﬁscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line
basis and is expected to be approximately $23.0 in ﬁscal 2017, $23.0 in fiscal 2018, $23.0 in ﬁscal 2019, $22.6 in fiscal
2020, and $21.2 in fiscal 2021.
The Company tests goodwill and indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more
frequently as facts and circumstances change, as required by ASC Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (“ASC
350”). The goodwill impairment test has three steps: a qualitative review and a two-step quantitative method. The
preliminary step allows for a qualitative analysis to determine the likelihood of impairment. If the qualitative review
results in a more likely than not probability of impairment, the ﬁrst quantitative step is required. The ﬁrst step identiﬁes
potential impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair
values can be determined based on a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of
future cash flows, a market multiple approach, and a comparable transaction approach. If the fair value of a reporting
unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not necessary. lfthe carrying
value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the second step calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing
the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying
value, an impairment charge is recorded. In ﬁscal 2016, a qualitative fair value analysis was used to determine the
likelihood of goodwill impairment for the Company’s one reporting unit. The analysis for goodwill did not result in an
impairment charge during ﬁscal 2016, 2015, or 2014.
