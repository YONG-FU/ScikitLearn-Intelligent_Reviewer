Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding, which has been modified to include the effects of all participating
securities (unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends) as prescribed by
the two-class method under ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260”), during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed similarly but reﬂects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive options were exercised and
restricted stock awards were vested. Stock options of approximately 40,000 and 44,000 were excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the effect of inclusion
would have been antidilutive. Approximately 4,000 and 26,000 shares of restricted stock were excluded from the diluted
earnings per share calculation for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The following table calculates basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share for the
years ended August 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014:
