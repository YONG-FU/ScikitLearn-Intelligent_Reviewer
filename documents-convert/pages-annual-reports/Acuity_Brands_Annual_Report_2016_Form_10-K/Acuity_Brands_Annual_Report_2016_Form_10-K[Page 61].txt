Multi-emplo yer Pension Plans
The Company contributes to three multi-employer deﬁned benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-
bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multi-
employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:
- Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to
employees of other participating employers.
- If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be
shared by the remaining participating employers.
- If a participating employer chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the
employer may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan,
referred to as a withdrawal liability.
The Company’s contributions to these plans were $0.7, $0.5, and $0.4 for the years ended August 31, 2016,
2015, and 2014, respectively. During fiscal 2016 as a result of closing a facility, the Company withdrew from one of
these multi-employer pension plans and incurred a withdrawal liability of $3.9.
