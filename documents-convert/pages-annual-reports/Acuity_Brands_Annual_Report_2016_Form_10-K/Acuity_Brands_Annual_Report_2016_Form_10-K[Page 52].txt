3. New Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2016
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance
Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes ("ASU 2015-17"), requiring that all tax liabilities and assets be classiﬁed as
noncurrent in a classiﬁed statement of ﬁnancial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17, which resulted in a reclassification of $23.1 from
current deferred income taxes to noncurrent deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
August 31, 2015.
Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting, ("ASU 2016-09"), which will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees.
ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December
15, 2016. The standard requires that all excess tax benefits and deficiencies currently recorded as additional paid in
capital be prospectively recorded in income tax expense. As such, implementation of this standard could create
volatility in the Company's effective income tax rate on a quarter by quarter basis. The volatility in the effective income
tax rate is due primarily to fluctuations in the Company's stock price and the timing of stock option exercises and
vesting of restricted share grants. The standard also requires excess tax beneﬁts to be presented as an operating
activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a ﬁnancing activity. This element of the guidance may be applied
retrospectively or prospectively. The Company intends to implement the standard as required in fiscal 2018.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, ("ASU 2016-02"), which requires lessees to
include most leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years (and interim reporting periods
within those years) beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
provisions of ASU 2016-02.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the
Accounting for Measurement—Period Adjustments ("ASU 2015-16"), which simpliﬁes the accounting for measurement-
period adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 is effective for ﬁscal
years (and interim reporting periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2016. The provisions of ASU
2015-16 are not expected to have a material effect on the Company's ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, or cash
ﬂows.
