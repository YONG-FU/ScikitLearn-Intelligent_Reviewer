estimates that each 100 basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional net
periodic pension cost of $1 .3 and $0.3 for domestic plans and international plans, respectively. The rate of compensation
increase is also evaluated and is adjusted by the Company, if necessary, annually.
The Company’s investment objective for domestic plan assets is to earn a rate of return sufﬁcient to match or
exceed the long-term growth of the plans’ liabilities without subjecting plan assets to undue risk. The plan assets are
invested primarily in high quality equity and debt securities. The Company conducts a periodic strategic asset allocation
study to form a basis for the allocation of pension assets between various asset categories. Specific allocation
percentages are assigned to each asset category with minimum and maximum ranges established for each. The assets
are then managed within these ranges. During ﬁscal 2016, the US. targeted asset allocation was 55% equity securities,
40% fixed income securities, and 5% real estate securities. The Company’s investment objective for the international
plan assets is also to add value by matching or exceeding the long-term growth of the plans’ liabilities. During ﬁscal
2016, the international asset target allocation approximated 60% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities, 10%
multi-strategy funds, and 5% real estate securities.
