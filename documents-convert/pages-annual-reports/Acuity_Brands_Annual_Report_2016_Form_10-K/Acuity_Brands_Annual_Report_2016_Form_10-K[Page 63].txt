before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense), as such terms are defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility agreement. These ratios are computed at the end of each ﬁscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period.
The Revolving Credit Facility allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.50 and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio
of 2.50, subject to certain conditions defined in the financing agreement. Generally, amounts outstanding under the
Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate”. Eurocurrency rate advances can be denominated in
a variety of currencies, including US dollars, and amounts outstanding bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to
the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) forthe applicable currency plus a margin as determined bythe Company's
leverage ratio (“Applicable Margin”). The Applicable Margin is based on the Company’s leverage ratio, as defined in
the Revolving Credit Facility, with such margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.575%. Additionally, the Company is required
to pay certain fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, including administrative service fees and an annual
facility fee. The annual facility fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is determined by the Company’s leverage ratio
as deﬁned in the Revolving Credit Facility. This facility fee ranges from 0.125% to 0.300% of the aggregate $250.0
commitment of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company was compliant with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility as of August 31,
2016. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $11.0, primarily for securing
collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and providing credit support for the

2016, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $243.9 under the most
restrictive covenant in effect atthe time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding
