MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
ACUITY BRANDS, INC.
The management of Acuity Brands, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is deﬁned in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial
reporting as of August 31, 2016. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of August 31, 2016, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting did
not include the internal controls of the acquired operations of Juno Lighting LLC and Distech Controls Inc. (collectively,
the “201 6 Acquisitions”), which are included in the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of August 31 , 2016
and for the period from the respective acquisition dates through August 31, 2016. As of August 31, 2016, the 2016
Acquisitions constituted less than 15% and 28% ofthe Company’s tangible assets and net tangible assets, respectively.
For the year ended August 31 , 2016, the 2016 Acquisitions constituted less than 10% of both the Company's net sales
and pre-tax income.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their audit of the
Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. This report dated October 27, 2016 is included within this Form 10-
