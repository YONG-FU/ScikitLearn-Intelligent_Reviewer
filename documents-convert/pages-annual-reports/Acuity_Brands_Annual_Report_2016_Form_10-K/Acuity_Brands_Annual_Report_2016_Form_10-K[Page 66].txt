Employee Deferred Share Units
The Company previously allowed employees to defer a portion of restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2003
and fiscal 2004 into the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (“SDSP”) as share units. The share units are payable
in shares of stock at the time of distribution from the SDSP. As of August 31, 2016, approximately 10,000 fully vested
share units remain deferred, but undistributed, under the 2012 Plan. There was no compensation expense related to
these share units during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Director Deferred Share Units
The Company previously required its Directors to defer at least 50% of their annual retainer into the 2006
Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan ("2006 Plan"). Shares deferred under the 2006 Plan are to be
paid in shares at retirement from the Board. In January 2012, the Company's stockholders approved the 2011
Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan ("2011 Plan"), following the expiration of the 2006 Plan on
November 30, 2011. Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, fees deferred by nonemployee directors can be invested in deferred
stock units to be paid in shares or credited to an interest-bearing account to be paid in cash at retirement from the
Board. 300,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2011 Plan, which incorporated
approximately 86,000 shares previously available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Beginning in ﬁscal year 2013, the
deferral requirement was adjusted to 55% of the annual director fees. On September 28, 2012, the 2011 Plan was
amended to allowfor stock grants in lieu of mandatory deferrals forthe non-cash component of a nonemployee director's
annual fee if a director exceeds the stock ownership requirement of ﬁve-times the annual cash retainer fee. Shares
available for issuance under both plans were approximately 400,000 at August 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. As of
August 31, 2016, approximately 130,000 share units were deferred, but undistributed, under the 2006 Plan and the
2011 Plan.
