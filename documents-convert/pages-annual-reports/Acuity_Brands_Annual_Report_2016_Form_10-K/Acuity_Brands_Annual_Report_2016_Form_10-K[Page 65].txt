As of August 31, 2016, there was $52.6 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted
stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The total fair value of shares
vested during the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, was approximately $18.8, $14.3, and $13.0,
respectively.
Stock Options
As of August 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 258,000 options outstanding to officers and other key
employees under the 2012 Plan. Options issued under the 2012 Plan are generally granted with an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant (but never less than the fair market value
on the grant date) and expire 10 years from the date of grant. These options generally vest and become exercisable
over a three-year period. The stock options granted under the Directors’ Plan vested and became exercisable one
year from the date of grant. Options under the Directors' Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the Company’s stock on the date of the grant and expire 10 years from that date. As of August 31, 2016, there were
no options outstanding under the Director’s Plan. Compensation expense recognized related to the awards under the
current and prior equity incentive plans was $2.9, $2.4, and $2.4 in ﬁscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. There
was no expense related to the director plan in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014.
The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The dividend
yield was calculated based on annual dividends paid and the trailing 12-month average closing stock price at the time
of grant. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock, calculated using the most recent
time period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield
for a term equal to the expected life of the options at the time of grant. The Company used historical exercise behavior
data of similar employee groups to determine the expected life of options. All inputs into the Black-Scholes model are
estimates made at the time of grant. Actual realized value of each option grant could materially differ from these
estimates, without impact to future reported net income.
The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in the
ﬁscal years ended August 31:
