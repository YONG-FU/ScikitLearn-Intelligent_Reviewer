ACUITY BRANDS, INC
7 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) 7
Accounts Receivable
The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes a reserve for doubtful
accounts to reﬂect losses anticipated on accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based on historical write-
offs, an analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and economic status of
customers, if known. Management believes that the allowance is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts; however,
there can be no assurance that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact
on the Company’s results of operations.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are generally limited due
to the wide variety of customers and markets using the Company’s lighting and building management solutions as well
as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. Receivables from The Home Depot were approximately
$62.7 and $59.9 at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10%
of consolidated receivables at August 31, 2016 or 2015. Additionally, net sales to The Home Depot accounted for
approximately 11% and 12% in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10%
of net sales in ﬁscal 2016.
Reclassifications
Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassiﬁed to conform to the current year presentation, including a
reclassification of $23.1 from current deferred income taxes to noncurrent deferred income taxes as ofAugust 31 , 2015
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2015-17. See the New
Accounting Pronouncements footnote for more information.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure for occurrences and transactions
after the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of August 31, 2016.
Inventories
Inventories include materials, direct labor, in-bound freight, and related manufacturing overhead, are stated at
the lower of cost (on a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out or average cost basis) or market, and consist of the following:
August 31,
i 2016 2015 7
[Raw materials, supplies, and work in process“) $ 170.3 $ 125.7 l
Finished goods 145.3 113.9
l 315.6 239.6 l
Less: Reserves 7 (20.4)? (14.8),
[Total Inventory is 295.2 :s 224.8l
(1) Due to the immaterial amount of estimated work in process and the short lead times for the conversion of raw materials to ﬁnished
goods, the Company does not believe the segregation of raw materials and work in process to be meaningful information.
Management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory
primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A signiﬁcant change in customer demand
or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s operating results in the period the change occurs.
Assets Held for Sale
The Company classifies assets as held for sale upon the development of a plan for disposal and in accordance
with applicable US. GAAP and ceases the depreciation and amortization of the assets at that date. The Company is
actively marketing the property classiﬁed as held for sale. As of August 31, 2016, the carrying value of the property
held for sale was $5.4, which is included in Prepayments and othercurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
