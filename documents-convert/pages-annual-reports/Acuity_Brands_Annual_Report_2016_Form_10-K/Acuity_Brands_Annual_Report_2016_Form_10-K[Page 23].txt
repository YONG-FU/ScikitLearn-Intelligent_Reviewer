cash received of $14.2 from stock issuances primarily in connection with stock option exercises. Cash generated from
operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current year primarily to fund acquisitions of $623.2
and capital expenditures of $83.7 as well as pay dividends to stockholders of $22.9. Foreign currency related items
had an unfavorable effect on cash flows of $4.0 during the current year.
During fiscal 2016, net cash generated from operating activities increased $56.8 to $345.7 compared with $288.9
generated in the prior-year period due primarily to higher net income partially offset by higher operating working capital
requirements. Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting
accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) increased by approximately
$53.3 during fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of $38.1 during fiscal 2015. Operating working capital requirements
increased primarily due to greater production and purchases necessary to support the higher level of net sales.
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on the
Company’s invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value. The Company invested $83.7 and $56.5 in
ﬁscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily for new tooling, machinery, equipment, facility enhancements, and
information technology.

(1) These amounts (which represent the amounts outstanding at August 31, 2016) are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for additional information regarding debt and other matters.
(2) These amounts represent primarily the expected future interest payments on outstanding debt held by the Company at August 31, 2016
and the Company’s outstanding loans related to its corporate-owned life insurance policies (“COLI”), which constitute a small portion of
the total amounts shown. COLl-related interest payments included in this table are estimates. These estimates are based on various
assumptions, including age at death, loan interest rate, and tax bracket. The amounts in this table do not include COLl-related payments
after ten years due to the difﬁculty in calculating a meaningful estimate that far in the future. Note that payments related to debt and the
COLl are reﬂected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
(3) The Company’s operating lease obligations are described in the Commitments and Contingencies footnote.
(4) Purchase obligations include commitments to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all
signiﬁcant terms, including open purchase orders.
(5) These amounts are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and largely represent other liabilities for which the Company
is obligated to make future payments under certain long-term employee benefit programs. Estimates of the amounts and timing of these
amounts are based on various assumptions, including expected return on plan assets, interest rates, and other variables. The amounts
in this table do not include amounts related to future funding obligations under the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans. The amount and timing
of these future funding obligations are subject to many variables and are also dependent on whether or not the Company elects to make
contributions to the pension plans in excess of those required under ERISA. Such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer the funding
obligations. See the Pension and Proﬁt Sharing Plans footnote for additional information. These amounts exclude $5.2 of unrecognized
tax beneﬁts as the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities cannot be reasonably estimated.
(6) Deferred income tax liabilities as ofAugust 31 , 2016 were approximately $187.8. Referto the Income Taxes footnote for more information.
This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because the Company believes this presentation would not be
meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported ﬁnancial
statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any
future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this
scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
Capitalization
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its
stockholders. Total debt outstanding, consisting primarily of ﬁxed-rate obligations net of discount and deferred costs,
was $355.2 at August 31, 2016 compared with $352.4 at August 31, 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Company borrowed
$2.5 under recently-executed ﬁxed rate long-term bank loans.
