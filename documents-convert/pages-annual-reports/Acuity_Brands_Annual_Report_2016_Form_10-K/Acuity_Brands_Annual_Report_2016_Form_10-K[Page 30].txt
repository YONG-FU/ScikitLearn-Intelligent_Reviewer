Gross Proﬁt
Gross proﬁt for ﬁscal 2015 increased $166.4, or 17.0%, to $1 ,145.6 compared with $979.2 for the prior year. The
increase in gross proﬁt margin was due primarily to additional contribution on higher net sales, lower material and
component costs, and improved manufacturing productivity. These items were partially offset by unfavorable price/
mix and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rate changes. As a result of these factors, gross profit margin
increased 140 basis points to 42.3% for the year ended August 31, 2015 compared with 40.9% for the year ended
August 31, 2014.
Operating Proﬁt
Selling, Distribution, and Administrative (“SD&A”) expenses for the year ended August 31 , 2015 increased $76.6,
or 11.3%, to $756.9 compared with $680.3 in the prior year. The increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to
higher costs to support the greater sales volume, including freight and commissions, and higher employee-related
costs, including variable incentive compensation costs, partially offset by savings from recent streamlining efforts.
Compared with the prior-year period, SD&A expenses as a percent of sales declined 40 basis points to 28.0% for fiscal
2015 from 28.4% in ﬁscal 2014. Adjusted SD&A expenses were $724.5, or 26.8% of net sales, in ﬁscal 2015 compared
to $657.2, or 27.5% of net sales, in the year-ago period.
During the year ended August 31 , 2015, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges of $1 2.4 related primarily
to the Company's continued efforts to streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within
various selling, distribution, and administrative departments and the consolidation of certain production activities. During
ﬁscal 2014, the Company recorded a reversal of pre-tax special charges of $0.2 due primarily to lower-than-anticipated
costs related to previously-initiated streamlining efforts of $0.6 partially offset by production transfer costs of $0.4.
Further details regarding the Company's special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating proﬁt for fiscal 2015 was $376.3 compared with $299.1 reported for the prior-year period, an increase
of $77.2, or 25.8%. Operating proﬁt margin increased 140 basis points to 13.9% for ﬁscal 2015 compared with 12.5%
for fiscal 2014 due primarily to higher gross proﬁt, partially offset by higher costs to support greater sales volume,
special charges, and employee-related costs, including variable incentive compensation.
Adjusted operating proﬁt increased $99.1, or 30.8%, to $421.1 compared with $322.0 for ﬁscal 2014. Adjusted
operating proﬁt margin increased 210 basis points to 15.6% compared with adjusted operating proﬁt margin of 13.5%

The effective income tax rate was 35.4% and 33.8% for the years ended August 31 , 2015 and 2014, respectively.

2015.
Net income forfiscal 2015 increased $46.3, or 26.3%, to $222.1 from $175.8 reported forfiscal 2014. The increase
in net income resulted primarily from higher operating proﬁt partially offset by higher tax expense.

diluted earnings per share for ﬁscal 2015 were $5.83 compared with $4.40 for fiscal 2014, which represented an
