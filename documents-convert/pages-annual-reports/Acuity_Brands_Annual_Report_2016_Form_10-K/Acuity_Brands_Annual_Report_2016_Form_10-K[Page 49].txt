ACUITY BRANDS, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
The impairment test for indefinite-lived trade names consists of comparing the fair value of the asset with its
carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of indeﬁnite-lived trade names using a fair value model based
on discounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss would
be recorded in the amount of the excess. Signiﬁcant assumptions, including estimated future net sales, royalty rates,
and discount rates, are used in the determination of estimated fair value for indeﬁnite-lived trade names. During fiscal
2016, management began to rationalize the Company's portfolio of brands, resulting in the initiation of the phase out
of one of the trade names. The Company recognized an impairment charge of $5.1 related to this trade name and
concluded the trade name is definite-lived. The impairment charge is included in Selling, Distribution, andAdministrative
Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The indefinite-lived intangible asset analysis
did not result in any other impairment charges, as the fair values exceeded the carrying values for each of the other
trade names. None of the analyses for the indefinite-lived trade names resulted in an impairment charge during fiscal
2015 or 2014.
