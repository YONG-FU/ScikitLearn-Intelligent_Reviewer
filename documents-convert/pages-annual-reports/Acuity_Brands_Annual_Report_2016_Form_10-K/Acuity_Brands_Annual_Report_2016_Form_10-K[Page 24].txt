The Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Company's prior $250.0 revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to
mature on January 31, 2017. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be
due and payable on August 27, 2019. The Company was compliant with all ﬁnancial covenants under the Revolving
Credit Facility as of August 31, 2016. As of August 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling
$11.0, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the casualty insurance programs for the Company and
providing credit support for the Company's industrial revenue bond. At August 31, 2016, the Company had additional
borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility of $243.9 under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the
time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less outstanding letters of credit of $6.1 issued
under the Revolving Credit Facility. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.
During ﬁscal 2016, the Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $299.8 to $1 ,659.8 at August 31 ,
2016 from $1 ,360.0 at August 31, 2015. The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, as well
as amortization of stock-based compensation, and stock issuances resulting primarily from the exercise of stock options,
partially offset by payment of dividends, pension plan adjustments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The
Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total
stockholders’ equity) was 17.6% and 20.6% at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The ratio of debt, net of cash,
to total capitalization, net of cash, was (3.6)% at August 31, 2016 and (42.3)% at August 31, 2015 as cash on hand
continued to exceed debt.
