The following table reconciles certain ﬁnancial measures prepared in accordance with US. generally accepted
accounting principles ("US GAAP") to the corresponding non-U.S. GAAP measures referred to in the discussion of
the Company’s results of operations, which exclude the impact of acquisition-related items, amortization of acquired
intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, impairment of intangible asset, special charges associated
primarily with continued efforts to streamline the organization, and net losses associated with ﬁnancial instruments.
Although special charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and share-based compensation expense have
been recognized in prior periods and could recur in future periods, management typically excludes the impact of these
charges during internal reviews of performance and uses these non-U.S. GAAP measures for baseline comparative
operational analysis, decision making, and other activities. Primarily due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed
during ﬁscal 2016, the Company experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangibles, share-based
payments used to improve retention and align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses, and special charges
due to activities to streamline and integrate those acquisitions. These non-U.S. GAAP ﬁnancial measures, including
adjusted gross proﬁt and margin, adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative expenses, adjusted operating proﬁt
and margin, adjusted other income/expense, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are provided
to enhance the user’s overall understanding ofthe Company’s current financial performance. Speciﬁcally, the Company
believes these non-U.S. GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the results of
operations. The non-U.S. GAAP ﬁnancial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or
superior to, results prepared in accordance with US. GAAP.
