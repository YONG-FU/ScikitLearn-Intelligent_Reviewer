associated with inbound freight and freight between manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are generally
recorded in Cost of Products Sold. Other shipping and handling costs are included in Selling, Distribution, and
Administrative Expenses and totaled $124.0, $105.6, and $100.9 in ﬁscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions in the ﬁnancial
statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued. The Company accounts for
stock options, restricted shares, and share units representing certain deferrals into the Director Deferred Compensation
Plan or the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (both of which are discussed further in the Share-Based Payments
footnote) based on the grant—date fair value estimated underthe current provisions ofASC Topic 718, Compensation —
Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”).
Share-based expense includes expense related to restricted stock and options issued, as well as share units
deferred into the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The Company recorded $27.7, $18.2, and $17.7 of share-
based expense for the years ending August 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The total income tax beneﬁt
recognized for share-based compensation arrangements was $9.6, $6.4, and $6.0 for the years ended August 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The Company accounts for any awards with graded vesting on a straight-line
basis. Additionally, forfeitures of share-based awards are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant
and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. The Company did not capitalize
any expense related to share-based payments and has recorded share-based expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
in Selling, Distribution, and Administrative Expenses.
Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized share-based compensation cost are reported as a financing
cash ﬂow, rather than as an operating cash flow, in the Company’s Statements of Cash Flows and amounted to $25.6,
$17.6, and $10.4 for ﬁscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
See the Share-Based Payments footnote for more information.
Depreciation
For ﬁnancial reporting purposes, depreciation is determined principally on a straight-line basis using estimated
useful lives of plant and equipment (10 to 40 years for buildings and related improvements and 3 to 15 years for
machinery and equipment), while accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement.
Depreciation expense amounted to $40.9, $34.4, and $31.8 during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Research and development (“R&D”) expense, which is expensed as incurred, consists of compensation, payroll
taxes, employee beneﬁts, materials, supplies, and other administrative costs, but does not include all new product
development costs, and is included in Selling, Distribution, andAdministrative Expenses in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Comprehensive Income. R&D expense amounted to $47.1, $41.1, and $35.3 during ﬁscal 2016, 2015,
and 2014, respectively.

and $13.3 during fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The increase during fiscal 2016 is primarily due to the
impact of acquisitions.

store beneﬁts, including lighting display maintenance. Costs associated with this program totaled $7.0, $6.6, and $6.1
