Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2016 increased by 21.6% compared with the prior-year period due primarily
to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 15% and the favorable impact of acquired revenues from acquisitions
of 9%, partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold ("price/
mix") of approximately 2% and unfavorable foreign currency rate changes of less than 1%. Sales volume was higher
across most product categories and key sales channels. Sales of LED-based luminaires during the year ended
August 31, 2016 increased almost 50% compared to the year-ago period and represented approximately 60% of total
net sales. The change in price/mix was due primarily to unfavorable pricing on LED luminaires, reﬂecting the decline
in certain LED component costs, as well as a change in sales channel mix. Due to the changing dynamics of the
Company's product portfolio, including the increase of integrated lighting and building management solutions as well
as the proliferation of new products due to the adoption of solid-state lighting, it is not possible to precisely quantify or
differentiate the individual components of volume, price and mix.
Gross Proﬁt
Gross profit for fiscal 2016 increased $290.6, or 25.4%, to $1 ,436.2 compared with $1 ,145.6 for the prior year.
The increase in gross proﬁt was due primarily to additional contribution on higher net sales, lower material and
component costs, and improved productivity. These items were partially offset by unfavorable price/mix, acquisition-
related items, and speciﬁcally in the fourth quarter, certain disruptions in the supply chain. As a result of these factors,
gross profit margin increased 130 basis points to 43.6% for the year ended August 31, 2016 compared with 42.3% for
the year ended August 31 , 2015.
Adjusted gross proﬁt for ﬁscal 2016 increased $293.4, or 25.6%, to $1 ,439.0 compared with $1 ,145.6 forthe prior
year. Adjusted gross proﬁt margin increased 140 basis points to 43.7% compared to 42.3% in the prior year.
Operating Proﬁt
Selling, Distribution, and Administrative (“SD&A”) expenses forthe year ended August 31 , 2016 increased $189.1,
or 25.0%, to $946.0 compared with $756.9 in the prior year. The increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to
higher costs to support the greater sales volume, including freight and commissions, higher employee-related costs,
higher amortization of acquired intangible assets related to recent acquisitions, certain other acquisition-related items,
and the impairment of an intangible asset. The increase in employee costs reflects the Company's investments in
capabilities related to areas of future growth as well as enhanced customer service. The increase in employee costs
also includes increased variable compensation expense as well as share-based compensation expense due primarily
to restricted stock issued as part of certain recent acquisitions. These items were partially offset by savings from recent
streamlining efforts. Compared with the prior-year period, SD&A expenses as a percent of sales increased 70 basis
points to 28.7% for fiscal 2016 from 28.0% in ﬁscal 2015. Adjusted SD&A expenses were $883.8, or 26.9% of net
sales, in fiscal 2016 compared to $724.5, or 26.8% of net sales, in the year-ago period.
The Company recognized pre-tax special charges of $15.0 during ﬁscal 2016 compared with pre-tax special
charges of $12.4 during fiscal 2015. These charges related primarily to the Company's continued efforts to integrate
recent acquisitions, streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within various selling,
distribution, and administrative departments, and the consolidation of certain production activities. Further details
regarding the Company's special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Operating proﬁt for fiscal 2016 was $475.2 compared with $376.3 reported for the prior-year period, an increase
of $98.9, or 26.3%. Operating proﬁt margin increased 50 basis points to 14.4% for ﬁscal 2016 compared with 13.9%
for fiscal 2015 due primarily to higher gross proﬁt, partially offset by higher costs to support greater sales volume,
special charges, employee-related costs, including variable incentive compensation, acquisition-related items, and the
impairment of an intangible asset.
Adjusted operating proﬁt increased $134.1, or 31.8%, to $555.2 compared with $421.1 for ﬁscal 2015. Adjusted
operating proﬁt margin increased 130 basis points to 16.9% compared with adjusted operating proﬁt margin of 15.6%
in the year-ago period.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense (income) for the Company consists principally of net interest expense and net miscellaneous
expense (income) which includes gains and losses related to foreign exchange rate changes. Interest expense, net,
was $32.2 and $31.5 for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company reported net
miscellaneous income of $1.6 in fiscal 2016 compared with net miscellaneous expense of $1 .2 in ﬁscal 2015.
