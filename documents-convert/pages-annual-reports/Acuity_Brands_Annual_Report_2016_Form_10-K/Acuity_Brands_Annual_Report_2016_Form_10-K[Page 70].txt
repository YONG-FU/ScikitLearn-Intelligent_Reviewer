11. Special Charge
During ﬁscal 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a pre-tax special charge consisting primarily of severance
and employee-related costs, for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent
acquisitions. These streamlining activities include the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment
of certain responsibilities, primarily within various selling, distribution, and administrative departments. The Company

allow it to reduce spending in certain areas while permitting continued investment in future growth initiatives, such as
new products, expanded market presence, and technology and innovation.

tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse, deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the differences between the ﬁnancial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability.
