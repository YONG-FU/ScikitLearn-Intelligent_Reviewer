Publicly-traded securities are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the period.
Investments traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the last day
of the period are valued at the last reported bid price.
Investments in real estate are stated at estimated fair values based on the fund management’s valuations and
upon appraisal reports prepared periodically by independent real estate appraisers. These investments are classiﬁed
as Level 3 assets within the fair value hierarchy. The purpose of the appraisal is to estimate the fair value of the real
estate as of a specific date based on the most probable price for which the appraised real estate will sell in a competitive
market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale. Estimated fair value is based on (i) discounted cash ﬂows using
certain market assumptions, including holding period, discount rates, capitalization rates, rent and expense growth
rates, future capital expenditures and the ultimate sale of the property at the end of the holding period; (ii) direct
capitalization method; or (iii) comparable sales method.
