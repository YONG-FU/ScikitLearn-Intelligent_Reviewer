Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2015 increased by 13.1% compared with the prior-year period due
primarily to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 15%, partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable change
in product prices and the mix of products sold ("price/mix") of approximately 1% and unfavorable foreign currency rate
changes of 1%. Sales volume was higher across most product categories and key sales channels as the Company
realized greater demand for LED-based luminaires. Sales of LED-based luminaires during the year ended August 31 ,
2015 increased 57% compared to the year-ago period and represented 46% of total net sales. The change in price/
mix was due primarily to unfavorable pricing on LED luminaires, reﬂecting the decline in certain LED component costs,
as well as a change in sales channel mix. Due to the changing dynamics of the Company's product portfolio, including
the increase of integrated lighting and building management solutions as well as the proliferation of new products due
to the adoption of solid-state lighting, it is not possible to precisely quantify volume or differentiate the individual
components of price/mix.
