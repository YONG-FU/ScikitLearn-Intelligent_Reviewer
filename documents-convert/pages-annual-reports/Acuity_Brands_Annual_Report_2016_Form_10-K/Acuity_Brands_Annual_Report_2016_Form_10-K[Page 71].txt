The Company currently intends to indeﬁnitely reinvest all undistributed earnings of and original investments in
foreign subsidiaries, which amounted to approximately $83.2 at August 31 , 2016; however, this amount could fluctuate
due to changes in business, economic, or other conditions. Earnings is the most signiﬁcant component of the basis
difference which is indefinitely reinvested. If these earnings were distributed to the US. in the form of dividends or
otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, the Company would
be subject to additional US. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding
taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings or investments
is not practicable.
At August 31, 2016, the Company had state tax credit carryfon/vards of approximately $1.1, which will expire
between 2018 and 2025. At August 31, 2016, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $24.3 that
expire beginning in 2030, state net operating loss carryforwards of $12.5 that begin expiring in 2028, and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of $21 .2 that begin expiring in 2017.
The gross amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts as ofAugust 31,2016 and 201 5 totaled $5.2 and $4.5, respectively,
which includes $3.9 and $2.2, respectively, of net unrecognized tax beneﬁts that, if recognized, would affect the annual
eﬁective tax rate. The Company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts as a
component of income tax expense; such accrued interest and penalties are not material. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to United States federal, state, and local income tax examinations for years ended before
2012 or for foreign income tax examinations before 2010. The Company does not anticipate unrecognized tax beneﬁts
will signiﬁcantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
