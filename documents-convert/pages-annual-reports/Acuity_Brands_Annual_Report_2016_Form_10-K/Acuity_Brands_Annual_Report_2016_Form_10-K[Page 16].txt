The Company believes that its properties are well maintained and in good operating condition and that its properties
are suitable and adequate for its present needs. During ﬁscal 2017, the Company expects to make investments to
expand capacity at certain manufacturing and other non-manufacturing facilities. In addition, initiatives related to
enhancing the global supply chain may result in the future consolidation of certain facilities.
Although a loss at any of the facilities could temporarily impact the Company’s ability to serve the needs of its
customers, a substantial loss at the Company’s largest manufacturing facilities in Mexico could have a material, adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash ﬂows. The Company believes the ﬁnancial
impact of any loss would be partially mitigated by various insurance programs in place as well as capacity contingencies
developed as part of an enterprise-wide contingency plan.
