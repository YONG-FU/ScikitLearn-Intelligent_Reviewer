ACUITY BRANDS, INC
7 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) 7
During ﬁscal 2015, the domestic plans recognized $10.5 related to the following amendments to the Acuity Brands,
Inc. 2002 Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan:
- An incremental beneﬁt was added for participants who were actively employed by the Company on June 26,
2015 (or who first become a participant on or after June 26, 2015). The incremental benefit provides a monthly
benefit for 1 80 months commencing at age 60 equal to 1.4% of the participant's "average annual compensation"
multiplied by his years of credited service not to exceed 10 years, divided by 12. Participants may elect to
receive the actuarial equivalent of the incremental benefit in the form of a lump sum cash payment.
- The deﬁnition of actuarial equivalent (with respect to accrued beneﬁts other than the participant’s vested
accrued beneﬁt as of December 31, 2004) was changed. Prior to the amendment, the deﬁnition of actuarial
equivalent used an interest rate equal to the lesser of 7% per annum or the yield on 10-Year US. Treasury
Bonds plus 1.50%; after the amendment, an interest rate equal to the lesser of 2.5% per annum or the yield
on 10-Year US. Treasury Bonds will be used.
- Upon the occurrence of a Section 409A change in control event (as defined in the SERP), the SERP shall be
terminated consistent with the requirements of Treasury Regulation section 1.409A—3(j)(4)(ix)(B), and the
Company shall, within ﬁve (5) days of such an event, pay to each participant a lump sum cash payment equal
to the lump sum actuarial equivalent of the participant’s accrued beneﬁt as of such date.

It is the Company’s policy to adjust, on an annual basis, the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit
obligation to approximate rates on high-quality, long-term obligations based on the Company’s estimated benefit
payments available as of the measurement date. The Company uses a publicly published yield curve to assist in the
development of its discount rates. The Company estimates that each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate
would result in reduced net periodic pension cost of approximately $1.2 and $1.6 for domestic plans and international
plans, respectively. The expected return on plan assets is derived from a periodic study of long-term historical rates
of return on the various asset classes included in the Company’s targeted pension plan asset allocation. The Company
