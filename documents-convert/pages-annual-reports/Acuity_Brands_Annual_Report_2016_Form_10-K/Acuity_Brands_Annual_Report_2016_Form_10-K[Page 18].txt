The indicated annual dividend rate on the Company's common stock is $0.52 per share. However, all decisions
regarding the declaration and payment of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the
"Board") and will be evaluated regularly in light of the Company’s ﬁnancial condition, earnings, growth prospects,
funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors that the Board deems relevant. The information required
by this item with respect to equity compensation plans is included under the caption Equity Compensation Plans in
the Company’s proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held January 6, 2017, to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A, and is incorporated herein by reference.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In September 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of two million shares of the Company's outstanding
common stock. None of the Company’s outstanding common stock has been repurchased under the current plan;
therefore, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the program equals two million.
Depending on market conditions, shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing market prices through
open market or privately negotiated transactions. No date has been established for the completion of the share
repurchase program and the Company is not obligated to repurchase any shares. Subject to applicable corporate
securities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate.
Repurchases under the program can be discontinued at any time management feels additional repurchases are not
warranted.
