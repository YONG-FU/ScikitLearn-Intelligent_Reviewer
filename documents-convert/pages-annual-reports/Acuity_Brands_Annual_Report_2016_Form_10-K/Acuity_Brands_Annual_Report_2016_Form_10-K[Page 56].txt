Investment in noncontrolling afﬁliate represents a strategic investment accounted for using the cost method. The
Company based the fair value of the investment on an offer by a third party to purchase the business. The sale
transaction subsequently closed in October 2016. (Level 3).
The senior unsecured public notes are carried at the outstanding balance, including bond discounts and deferred
costs, as of the end of the reporting period. Fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash ﬂows using rates
currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
The industrial revenue bond is carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period. The
industrial revenue bond is a tax-exempt, variable-rate instrument that resets on a weekly basis; therefore, the Company
estimates that the face amount of the bond approximates fair value as of August 31, 2016 based on bonds of similar
terms and maturity (Level 2).
The bank loans are carried at the outstanding balance as of the end of the reporting period. Fair value is estimate
based on discounted future cash ﬂows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2).
ASC 825 excludes certain ﬁnancial instruments and all nonﬁnancial instruments from its disclosure requirements.
Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to the Company. In
many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the
disclosed value be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. In evaluating the Company’s management of
liquidity and other risks, the fair values of all assets and liabilities should be taken into consideration, not only those
presented above.
