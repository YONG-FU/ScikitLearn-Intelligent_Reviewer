Reinsurance segment
For the reinsurance segment, the December 31, 2016 estimate of loss and settlement expense reserves for accident years
2015 and prior decreased $10.9 million from the estimate at December 31, 2015. This decrease represents 5.5 percent of the
December 31, 2015 carried reserves. Approximately $7.1 million of favorable development is attributable to the HORAD book
of business, with the remaining $3.8 million of favorable development associated with MRB.
In the HORAD book of business, $7.4 million of favorable development occurred in the pro rata line of business and
$0.3 million of adverse development occurred in the excess of loss line of business. The favorable development in the pro rata
line of business primarily occurred in the 2015 accident year, with accident years 2012 - 2014 generating $1.4 million of
adverse development and the remaining prior accident years experiencing little development in the aggregate. In the excess of
loss line of business, the 2015 accident year experienced over $3.0 million of favorable development; however, this favorable
development was more than offset by adverse development in many of the prior 21 accident years, with the greatest amount of
adverse development concentrated in accident years 2005 - 2014.
The favorable development experienced on the MRB business is mostly attributed to an increase in the amount of
negative bulk IBNR loss reserve carried on prior years' reserves. Recent actuarial reviews of MRB's reported reserves have
consistently indicated that those reserves challenged the upper level of the range of reasonable reserves. To address this issue, a
$2.0 million negative bulk IBNR loss reserve was established in 2015 for this business. During 2016, the negative bulk IBNR
loss reserve was increased to $4.0 million, with $5.3 million of negative IBNR loss reserve carried on prior accident years and
$1.3 million of positive lag IBNR loss reserve carried on the 2016 accident year. The recognition of the additional negative
IBNR loss reserve accounts for $3.3 million of the $3.8 million of favorable development experienced during 2016.
During 2016, the expected loss ratios utilized for prior contract years remained unchanged, except for ocean marine pro
rata business. The expected loss ratios associated with this contract type were decreased by approximately 2.5, 4.0 and 5.0
percentage points for contract years 2012, 2014 and 2015, respectively, from the ratios utilized during 2015. Additionally, the
expected loss ratio for contract year 2013 was increased by approximately 2.0 percentage points relative to the 2015 value.
These changes were made in response to reserving information supplied by the ceding company, a large writer of ocean marine
pro rata business.
The expected loss ratios utilized for the 2016 contract year were based on an extensive actuarial analysis of trended
historic ultimate loss ratios based on current-level earned premiums. Where applicable, new contract loss information or loss
histories were also incorporated into the reserving process. Compared to the 2015 contract year selections, the 2016 contract
year expected loss ratios for per risk excess and casualty excess business increased by 2.5 percentage points, while the expected
loss ratio for aggregate excess business decreased by 5.0 percentage points. The 2016 contract year expected loss ratio for
ocean marine pro rata business increased approximately 2.5 percentage points above the initial 2015 contract year selection, but
is now approximately 7.5 percentage points above the revised ratio.
Year ended December 31, 2015
Property and casualty insurance segment
For the property and casualty insurance segment, the December 31, 2015 estimate of loss and settlement expense
reserves for accident years 2014 and prior decreased $13.8 million from the estimate at December 31, 2014. This decrease
represented 3.0 percent of the December 31, 2014 carried reserves. No changes were made in the key actuarial assumptions
utilized to estimate loss and settlement expense reserves during 2015; however, the accident year allocation factors applied to
IBNR loss reserves, bulk case loss reserves, and the defense and cost containment portion of settlement expense reserves were
revised at December 31, 2015 as part of the annual review. This change resulted in the movement of $423,000 of reserves from
prior accident years to the current accident year, and hence, was reported as favorable development on prior years' reserves.
Reserves on previously reported claims developed favorably in 2015 by approximately $8.5 million. This includes
$514,000 of adverse development attributable to revised accident year allocation factors for bulk case loss reserves, which was
offset by $7.5 million of favorable development experienced on prior years’ reported claims (exclusive of the bulk case loss
reserve) and $1.5 million of favorable development from changes in the line of business distribution of the bulk case loss
reserves. Of the $8.5 million of favorable development, accident years 2012—20 14 experienced favorable development of $7.0
million. While all lines of business continued to experience very favorable development on claims which “closed” during
2015, adverse development on claims remaining “open” in the commercial auto liability line outpaced the favorable
development experienced on "closed" claims by $6.5 million. Favorable development on the combined "case plus bulk case
loss reserves" occurred in all lines of business except commercial auto liability, which experienced adverse development of
$2.5 million, and homeowners, which experienced adverse development of $28,000 mostly attributable to a reallocation of the
bulk case reserve. The following table displays the development experienced on previously reported claims, as well as the
development amounts generated by the change in accident year allocation factors, by line of business:
