Although reinsurance does not discharge the original insurer from its primary liability to its policyholders, it is the
practice of insurers for accounting purposes to treat reinsured risks as risks of the reinsurer since the primary insurer would
only re-assume liability in those situations where the reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations it assumes under the
reinsurance agreements. The ability to collect reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers.
The major reinsurers in the pool participants’ reinsurance programs during 2016 are presented below. The percentages
represent the reinsurers’ share of the total reinsurance protection under all coverages. Each type of coverage is purchased in
layers, and an individual reinsurer may participate in more than one type of coverage and at various layers within these
coverages. All programs (except the boiler, data compromise, cyber liability, identity recovery, and employment practice
liability programs, as well as the top layer of the property catastrophe program) are handled by reinsurance brokers. The
reinsurance of those programs is syndicated to 53 domestic and foreign reinsurers.
In formulating reinsurance programs, Employers Mutual is selective in its choice of reinsurers. Employers Mutual
selects reinsurers on the basis of financial stability and long-term relationships, as well as the price and coverage terms.
Reinsurers are generally required to have an AM. Best rating of “A” (Excellent) or higher and a minimum policyholders’
surplus of $500.0 million.
