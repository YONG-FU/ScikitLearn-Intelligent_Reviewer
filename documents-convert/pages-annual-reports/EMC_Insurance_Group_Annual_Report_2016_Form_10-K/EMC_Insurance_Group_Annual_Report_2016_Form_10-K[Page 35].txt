Approximately 98 percent of the favorable development experience for personal auto liability stemmed from reserve
take-downs on two large Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association unlimited personal injury protection claims which were
reported in 2002 and 2003. Similar to 2013, commercial auto liability’s adverse development is associated with a small number
of previously reported claims which experienced very significant upwards revisions in carried reserves and payments. Of the
total number of reported claims for this line, 18 percent developed adversely by more than $100,000, representing $11.2
million of adverse development. The development on the remaining 98.2 percent of commercial auto liability claims was a
favorable $1.7 million. Management believes prior accident years underwent significant strengthening during 2014, and that
the 2014 accident year is more adequately reserved than the 2013 accident year was at year-end 2013. Both workers'
compensation and other liability, which experienced adverse development on combined open and closed previously reported
claims at year-end 2013, exhibited favorable development as of year-end 2014, similar to year-end 2012. The remaining lines
of business experienced favorable development, though somewhat less than in 2013 which had a larger favorable impact from
the revision of the bulk case loss reserve accident year allocation factors.
IBNR loss reserves experienced $201,000 of adverse development, which was attributed to higher than expected
emergence ($1.4 million) and exposure growth ($1.9 million). These items were almost completely offset by favorable
development from changes in the IBNR accident year allocation factors ($1.8 million), and reserve decreases taken as the result
of scheduled reserve reviews ($1.2 million). Four of the eight reserving lines experienced adverse IBNR loss reserve
development, with higher than expected emergence being the main driver for each. The lines experiencing adverse
development included commercial property ($3.4 million), auto physical damage ($970,000), homeowners ($886,000) and
commercial auto liability ($291,000). Adverse development on the property lines of business is not totally unexpected.
Favorable development is consistently observed on reported property claims, therefore, lower levels of IBNR loss reserves are
generally carried to offset perceived redundancies. Favorable development, generally driven by lower than expected
emergence and/or decreases in carried reserves from scheduled reviews, was experienced in other liability ($4.3 million),
workers' compensation ($846,000), surety bonds ($250,000) and personal auto liability ($3,000). The following table displays
the development experienced on IBNR loss reserves from each of these factors, by line of business:
