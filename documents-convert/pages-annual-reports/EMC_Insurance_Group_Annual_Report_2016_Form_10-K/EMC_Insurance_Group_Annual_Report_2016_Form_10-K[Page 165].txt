13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has no stock-based compensation plans of its own; however, Employers Mutual has several stock plans
which utilize the common stock of the Company. Employers Mutual can provide the common stock required under its plans
by: 1) using shares of common stock that it currently owns; 2) purchasing common stock in the open market; or 3) directly
purchasing common stock from the Company at the current fair value. Employers Mutual's current practice is to purchase
common stock from the Company for use in all of its stock plans (including its non—employee director stock purchase plan and
its employee stock purchase plan).
Stock Plans
Employers Mutual currently maintains two separate stock plans for the benefit of oﬁicers and key employees of
Employers Mutual and its subsidiaries. A total of 2,250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock have been reserved for
issuance under the 2003 Employers Mutual Casualty Company Incentive Stock Option Plan (2003 Plan) and a total of
3,000,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the 2007 Employers Mutual Casualty Company Stock Incentive Plan
(2007 Plan). During 2016, the compensation committee of Employers Mutual and the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee of the Company approved the issuance of restricted stock awards to the non-employee directors of the Company
under the 2007 Plan.
The 2003 Plan permitted the issuance of incentive stock options only, while the 2007 Plan permits the issuance of
performance shares, performance units, and other stock-based awards, in addition to qualified (incentive) and non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Both plans provide for a ten-year time limit
for granting awards. No additional options can be granted under the 2003 Plan due to the expiration of the term of the plan.
Options granted under the plans generally have a vesting period of five years, with options becoming exercisable in equal
annual cumulative increments commencing on the first anniversary of the option grant. Option prices cannot be less than the
fair value of the common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan generally have a
vesting period of four years, with shares vesting in equal annual cumulative increments commencing on the first anniversary of
the grant. With the exception of death or permanent disability, any unvested shares of restricted stock are forfeited on
termination of employment, including retirement. Holders of unvested shares of restricted stock receive compensation income
equal to the amount of any dividends declared on the common stock. During 2016, 2,000 shares of restricted stock were
granted to non-employee directors of the Company. These shares of restricted stock vest over a period of three years, or upon a
director reaching 75 years of age while an active director.
The Senior Executive Compensation Committee of Employers Mutual ’8 Board of Directors grants the awards and is the
administrator of the plans. The Company’s Compensation Committee must consider and approve all awards granted to the
Company’s executive officers. Awards granted to directors are approved by the Company's Corporate Governance and
Nominating Committee.
The Company recognized compensation expense from these plans of $788,000 ($512,000 net of tax), $500,000
($325,000 net of tax) and $357,000 ($233,000 net of tax) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Due to the historically small
number of forfeitures, the Company has elected to recognize the reduction to compensation expense from forfeitures as they
occur.
A summary of the stock option activity under Employers Mutual’s stock plans for 2016, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:
