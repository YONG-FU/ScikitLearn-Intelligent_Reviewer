Mutual. Eﬁective February 1, 2013, the interest rate on the surplus notes was reduced to 1.35 percent. Reviews of the interest
rate are conducted by the Inter-Company Committees of the boards of directors of the Company and Employers Mutual every
five years, with the next review due in 2018. Payments of interest and repayments of principal can only be made out of the
applicable subsidiary’s statutory surplus and are subject to prior approval by the insurance commissioner of the respective
states of domicile. The surplus notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all obligations or liabilities of the
applicable insurance subsidiaries. Total interest expense on these surplus notes was $337,000 in 2016, 2015 and 2014. At
December 31, 2016, the Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries had received approval for the payment of the
