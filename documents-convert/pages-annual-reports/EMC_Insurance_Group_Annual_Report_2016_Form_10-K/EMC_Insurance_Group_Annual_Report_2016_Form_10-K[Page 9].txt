regarding fonNard—looking statements. Accordingly, any fonNard-looking statement contained in this report is based on management’s current beliefs,

the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives may vary materially from those expressed in the fonNard-
looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:
° catastrophic events and the occurrence of significant severe weather conditions;
° the adequacy of loss and settlement expense reserves;
° state and federal legislation and regulations;
° changes in the property and casualty insurance industry, interest rates or the performance of financial markets and the general economy;
° rating agency actions;
° “other—than—temporary” investment impairment losses; and
° other risks and uncertainties inherent to the Company’s business, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management intends to identify fonNard-looking statements when using the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” or similar
expressions. Undue reliance should not be placed on these fonNard—looking statements.
