The property and casualty insurance segment's new bulk reserving methodology is based on explicit assumptions
concerning the ultimate number (frequency) and average size (severity) of claims expected to be incurred. The prior
methodology separated the calculation of the aggregate reserves from the allocation of those reserves to the various accident
years, and thus did not utilize explicit claim frequency and severity assumptions. Under the new reserving methodology,
management seeks to better align expected and actual development by line of business and accident year. As this is a
transitional year, there are some discontinuities in the development amounts reported for 2016. The following comments are
based on a comparison of the explicit assumptions underlying the December 31, 2016 carried reserves to the implicit
assumptions underlying the December 31, 2015 carried reserves.
In the table above, five of the seven lines of business exhibited favorable development on a fairly consistent basis over
the prior five accident years, those being personal lines, auto physical damage, workers” compensation, other liability and other.
For these lines of business, favorable development for most accident years was driven by decreases in the frequency and/or
severity assumptions underlying the estimated ultimate accident year loss and allocated settlement expense ratios. The
workers” compensation line of business experienced adverse development on accident years prior to 2011, as management
strengthened those reserves in response to increases in the severity assumptions for those years due to the expansion of the
experience review period to thirty-five accident years.
The commercial auto liability line of business experienced adverse development in each of the latest three accident
years. Comparing the explicit assumptions utilized at December 31, 2016 to the implicit assumptions underlying the December
31, 2015 reserves, the ultimate claim frequency and severity assumptions for accident year 2015 were underestimated by 1.8
percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. Using the same comparison, claims severity for accident year 2014 was underestimated
by 3.4 percent, and for accident year 2013, claim frequency was slightly underestimated.
The commercial property line of business experienced the greatest number of development discontinuities by accident
year in connection with the change in reserving methodology. Under the previous methodology, negative bulk case loss
reserves were often carried in the commercial property line of business due to the perceived strength of the case loss reserves
relative to the other lines of business. With the elimination of the bulk case loss reserves under the new methodology, the
reserves for the commercial property line of business were reallocated in total and by accident year in accordance with the
explicit claim frequency and severity assumptions developed during 2016. The implicit assumptions utilized at year-end 2015
underestimated claim frequency for each of the five most recent accident years, and underestimated loss severity for all of those
years except 2014.
The Company increased asbestos and environmental IBNR loss and settlement expense reserves by $3.5 million during
2016, which is primarily reﬂected in the other liability line of business. The increase was in response to an indicated increase
in the ultimate asbestos liability produced by internal payout decay models. Management also notes that AM. Best increased
the industry’s estimated ultimate liability by $15 billion during 2016. Newly reported asbestos claims have decreased slightly
for the last two calendar years. Asbestos and environmental reserves constitute less than 3 percent of the property and casualty
insurance segment’s total direct reserves.
