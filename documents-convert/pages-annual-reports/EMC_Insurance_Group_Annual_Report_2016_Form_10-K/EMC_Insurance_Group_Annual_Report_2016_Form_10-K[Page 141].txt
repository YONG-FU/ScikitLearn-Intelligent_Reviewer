5. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS
The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental related claims associated with the insurance business written
by the parties to the pooling agreement and the reinsurance business assumed from Employers Mutual by the reinsurance
subsidiary. Asbestos and environmental losses paid by the Company have averaged $2.0 million per year over the past five
years. Reserves for asbestos and environmental related claims for direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business totaled
$13.3 million and $11.5 million ($13.0 million and $11.2 million net of reinsurance) at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
Estimating loss and settlement expense reserves for asbestos and environmental claims is very difficult due to the many
uncertainties surrounding these types of claims. These uncertainties exist because the assignment of responsibility varies
widely by state and claims often emerge long after a policy has expired, which makes assignment of damages to the appropriate
party and to the time period covered by a particular policy diﬁicult. In establishing reserves for these types of claims,
management monitors the relevant facts concerning each claim, the current status of the legal environment, social and political
conditions, and claim history and trends within the Company and the industry.
At present, the pool participants are defending approximately 1,856 asbestos bodily injury lawsuits, some of which
involve multiple plaintiffs. Most of the lawsuits are subject to express reservation of rights based upon the lack of an injury
within the applicable policy periods, because many asbestos lawsuits do not specifically allege dates of asbestos exposure or
dates of injury. The pool participants’ policyholders named as defendants in these asbestos lawsuits are typically peripheral
defendants who have little or no exposure and are often dismissed from asbestos litigation with nominal or no payment (i.e.,
small contractors, supply companies, and a furnace manufacturer).
Prior to 2008, actual losses paid for asbestos-related claims had been minimal due to the plaintiffs’ failure to identify an
exposure to any asbestos-containing products associated with the pool participants’ current and former policyholders.
However, paid losses and settlement expenses have increased significantly since 2008 as a result of claims attributed to one
former policyholder. During the period 2009 through 2016, the Company's share of paid losses and settlement expenses
attributed to this former policyholder, a furnace manufacturer, was $11.2 million (mostly settlement expenses). A coverage-in-
place agreement was executed with this former policyholder in 2009 and a national coordinating counsel was retained to
address the multi-state litigation issues. The asbestos exposure associated with this former policyholder has increased in recent
years, and this trend may possibly continue into the future with increased per plaintiff settlements. Approximately 728 asbestos
exposure claims associated with this former policyholder remain open.
While the Company does not have a significant amount of exposure to asbestos claims, management has been
strengthening the reserves carried for these exposures each year to the amount believed to be management's best estimate. In
2016, the loss and settlement expense reserves for asbestos claims were strengthened approximately $3.5 million.
