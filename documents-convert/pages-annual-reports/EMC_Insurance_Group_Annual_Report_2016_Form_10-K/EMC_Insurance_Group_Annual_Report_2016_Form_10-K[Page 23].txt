Statutory Combined Trade Ratios
The following table sets forth the statutory combined trade ratios of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, and the
property and casualty insurance industry averages, for the five years ended December 31, 2016. The combined trade ratios
below are the sum of the following: the loss and settlement expense ratio, calculated by dividing losses and settlement
expenses incurred by net premiums earned, and the expense ratio, calculated by dividing underwriting expenses incurred by net
premiums written and policyholder dividends by net premiums earned. Generally, if the combined trade ratio is below 100
percent, a company has an underwriting profit; if it is above 100 percent, a company has an underwriting loss.

1 Beginning in 2014, the expense ratios for the Company's property and casualty insurance subsidiaries reﬂect net periodic
postretirement benefit income allocated to them as a result of a plan amendment to Employers Mutual's postretirement medical
plan, which created a large prior service credit that is being amortized into benefit expense over a period of 10 years. In
addition, the service cost and interest cost components of the revised plan's net periodic benefit cost are significantly lower than
those of the prior plan. The 2013 expense ratio and combined trade ratio for “reinsurance” and “total insurance operations”
reﬂect $532,000 of negative premiums written (net of $53,000 reduction in the amount ceded to Employers Mutual under the
inter-company reinsurance program) and $223,000 of negative commission expense that were recorded in connection with the
change in Employers Mutual’s participation in MRB. Excluding these adjustments, the expense ratio and combined trade ratio
for “reinsurance” would have been 23.8 percent and 82.8 percent, respectively, and for “total insurance operations” would have
been unchanged at 32.3 percent and 97.5 percent, respectively. The 2012 expense ratio and combined trade ratio for
“reinsurance” and “total insurance operations” reﬂect $3.1 million of negative premiums written (net of $341,000 reduction in
the amount ceded to Employers Mutual under the inter-company reinsurance program) and $1.4 million of negative
commission expense that were recorded in connection with the cancellation of a large pro rata account written by MRB.
Excluding these adjustments, the expense ratio and combined trade ratio for “reinsurance” would have been 22.4 percent and
90.8 percent, respectively, and for “total insurance operations” would have been 32.4 percent and 99.1 percent, respectively.
