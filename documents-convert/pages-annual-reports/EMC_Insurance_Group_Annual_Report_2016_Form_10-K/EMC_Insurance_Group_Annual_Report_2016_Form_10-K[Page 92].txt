Acquisition and other expenses
Acquisition and other expenses increased 7.6 percent to $191.8 million in 2016 from $178.3 million in 2015. The
acquisition expense ratio increased to 32.4 percent in 2016 from 31.3 percent in 2015. Acquisition and other expenses reported
for both years include net periodic postretirement benefit income resulting from the amortization of a large prior service credit
that resulted from an amendment of Employers Mutual's postretirement medical plan in the fourth quarter of 2013. This prior
service credit was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the fourth quarter of 20 13, and is being amortized
out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income over a period of 10 years. The increase in the 2016 ratio
is primarily attributed to higher policyholder dividend expense in the property and casualty insurance segment.
The acquisition expense ratio for the property and casualty insurance segment increased to 34.8 percent in 2016 from
32.9 percent in 2015. The increase is primarily attributed to higher policyholder dividend expense resulting from favorable loss
experience on some safety dividend groups. The 2016 ratio also reﬂects the premiums ceded to Employers Mutual under the
new inter-company reinsurance program, which added 0.6 percentage points to the ratio.
The acquisition expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to 24.3 percent in 2016 from 25.1 percent in
2015. The 2015 ratio reﬂects a $1.1 million commission adjustment for prior periods reported by a ceding company. A
decrease in contingent commission expense on the offshore energy and liability proportional account contributed to the decline
in the acquisition expense ratio in 2016. The 2016 ratio also reﬂects the reduction in the total cost of the revised inter-company
reinsurance program with Employers Mutual, which reduced the acquisition expense ratio by 0.2 percentage points.
Investment results
Net investment income increased 4.2 percent to $47.5 million in 2016 from $45.6 million in 2015. The increase is
primarily attributed to a higher amount of dividend income in 2016, but also reﬂects an increase in investment income from
other long-term investments. The Company’s equity portfolio produced dividend income of $6.9 million and $5.6 million in
2016 and 2015, respectively. Current interest rate levels remain below the average book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio,
and will therefore likely continue to limit future growth in net investment income. The average coupon rate on the fixed
maturity portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, has declined slightly over the past year, coming in at 3.8 percent at
December 31, 2016 compared to 3.9 percent at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. The effective duration of the fixed maturity
portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, increased to 5.2 at December 31, 2016 from 4.6 at December 31, 2015.
The Company reported net realized investment gains of $4.1 million in 2016, compared to $6.2 million in
2015. Included in these amounts are losses of $6.3 million and $1.5 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, from declines in
the carrying value of a limited partnership that the Company has invested in since 2014 to help protect the equity portfolio from
a sudden and significant decline in value (an equity tail-risk hedging strategy). Due to the sharp decline in the equity markets
in August of 20 15, the losses from this investment were much lower in 2015. The large amount of losses experienced in 2016
were more than oﬂset by gains recognized during the fourth quarter from the sale of some equity securities in connection with a
small re-balance of the investment portfolio. The Company recognized "other-than-temporary" impairment losses of $ 1 .3
million and $1.5 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. With the exception of a $209,000 impairment loss recorded in
2016 on a new investment that conveys investment tax credits (included in other long-term investments), these impairment
losses were recognized on securities held in the Company's equity portfolio.
Other income
Included in other income are foreign currency exchange gains and losses recognized on the reinsurance segment’s
foreign currency denominated reinsurance business. The reinsurance segment had foreign currency exchange gains of
$356,000 and $898,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Income tax
Income tax expense decreased 20.9 percent to $17.0 million in 2016 from $21.5 million in 2015. The effective tax rate
for 2016 was 26.9 percent, compared to 30.0 percent in 2015. The primary contributors to the differences between these
effective tax rates and the United States federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent are tax-exempt interest income earned, the
dividends received deduction, and, in 2016, $1.5 million of investment tax credits recognized from a renewable energy tax
credit investment.
