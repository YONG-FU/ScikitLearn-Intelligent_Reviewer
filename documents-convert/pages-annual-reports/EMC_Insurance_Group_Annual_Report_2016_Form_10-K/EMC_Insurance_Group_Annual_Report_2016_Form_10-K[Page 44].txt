The Company’s investment strategy is to conservatively manage its investment portfolio by investing primarily in
readily marketable, investment-grade fixed maturity securities and equity securities. The board of directors of each of the
Company’s insurance company subsidiaries has established investment guidelines and regularly reviews the portfolio for
compliance with those guidelines. The Company does not hold foreign denominated investments. The Company does not
purchase non-investment grade securities. Any non-investment grade securities held are the result of rating downgrades that
occurred subsequent to their purchase.
At December 31, 2016, the portfolio of ﬁxed maturity securities consisted of 0.7 percent US. Treasury, 21.0 percent
government agency, 14.0 percent asset-backed, 26.9 percent municipal and 37.4 percent corporate securities. As of
December 31, 2016, the effective duration of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, was
5.2, and the eﬁective duration of its liabilities was 3.1. At December 31, 2016, the Company held $3.0 million of non-
investment grade fixed maturity securities in a net unrealized gain position of $50,000.
The Company has two separate common stock equity portfolios that are diversiﬁed across a large range of industry
sectors and are managed for fees based on total assets under management (a large-cap blend equity portfolio managed by BMO
Global Asset Management and a high dividend value equity portfolio managed by Schafer Cullen Capital Management). As of
December 31, 2016, the common stock equity portfolios were invested in the following industry sectors:

The Company's other long-term investments consist of minority ownership interests in limited partnerships and limited
liability companies. During 2016 and 2015, the Company invested $4.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in a limited
partnership that is designed to help protect the Company from a sudden and significant decline in the value of its equity
portfolio (an equity tail-risk hedging strategy). This investment is carried under the equity method of accounting, with changes
in the carrying value (from both expired hedging contracts and changes in the value of contracts that are still in eﬁect) reported
as realized gains or losses in the Company's financial statements. During 2016, the Company's reinsurance subsidiary invested
approximately $6.6 million in a limited liability company designed to provide a return on investment through the receipt of
renewable energy tax credits. After reductions for the utilization of the tax credits and a $209,000 impairment loss, the carrying
value of this investment was approximately $2.0 million at December 31, 2016.
