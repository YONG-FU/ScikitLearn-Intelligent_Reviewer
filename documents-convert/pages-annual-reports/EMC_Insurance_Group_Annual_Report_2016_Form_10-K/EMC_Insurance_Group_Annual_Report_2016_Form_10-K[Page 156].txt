Gains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are included in net income. The cost of investments sold is
determined on the specific identification method using the highest cost basis first. The Company did not have any outstanding
cumulative credit losses on fixed maturity securities that have been recognized in earnings from “other-than—temporary”
impairments during any of the reported periods. The amounts reported as “other-than—temporary” impairments on equity
securities do not include any individually significant items. The net realized investment losses recognized on other long-term
investments primarily represent changes in the carrying value of a limited partnership that is used solely to support an equity
tail-risk hedging strategy, but for 2016 also includes an "other-than—temporary" impairment loss of $209,000 on a new
investment that conveys investment tax credits.
