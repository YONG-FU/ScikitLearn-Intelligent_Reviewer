The 2003 Plan does not generally generate income tax deductions for the Company because only incentive stock options
could be issued under the plan. The Company has recorded a deferred income tax benefit for a portion of the compensation
expense associated with the March 2008 grant and for all subsequent grants (all made under the 2007 Plan) because non-
qualified options and restricted stock awards were issued. The Company’s portion of the current income tax deduction realized
from exercises of non-qualified stock options was $284,000, $121,000 and $152,000 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
These actual deductions are generally in excess of the deferred tax benefits recorded in conjunction with the compensation
expense (referred to as excess tax benefits), which reduce income tax expense (prior to 2016 were recorded to additional paid in
capital). The income tax benefit that results from disqualifying dispositions of stock purchased through the exercise of
incentive stock options is deemed immaterial.
