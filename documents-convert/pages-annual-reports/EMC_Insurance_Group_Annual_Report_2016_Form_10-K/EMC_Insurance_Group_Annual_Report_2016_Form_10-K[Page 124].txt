In connection with the change in the inter-company reinsurance program in 2016, the reinsurance subsidiary began
purchasing additional reinsurance protection in peak exposure territories from external parties in which coverage is triggered
when losses experienced by the insurance industry from a catastrophic event exceed a specified threshold. Any reinsurance
recoveries received from external parties reduces the amount of losses ceded to Employers Mutual under the inter-company
reinsurance program. The net cost of the external reinsurance protection was approximately $3.5 million in 2016.
The reinsurance subsidiary does not directly reinsure any of the insurance business written by Employers Mutual or the
other pool participants; however, Employers Mutual assumes reinsurance business from the Mutual Reinsurance Bureau
underwriting association (MRB), which provides a small amount of reinsurance protection to the members of the EMC
Insurance Companies pooling agreement. As a result, the reinsurance subsidiary’s assumed exposures include a small portion
of the EMC Insurance Companies’ direct business, after ceded reinsurance protections purchased by MRB are applied. In
addition, the reinsurance subsidiary does not reinsure any “involuntary” facility or pool business that Employers Mutual
assumes pursuant to state law. The reinsurance subsidiary assumes all foreign currency exchange gain/loss associated with
contracts incepting on January 1, 2006 and thereafter that are subject to the quota share agreement. Operations of the quota
share agreement and the inter-company reinsurance program, as well as the purchase of the reinsurance protection from
external parties, give rise to inter-company balances with Employers Mutual, which are generally settled during the month
following the end of each quarter. The investment and income tax activities of the reinsurance subsidiary are not subject to the
quota share agreement.
Premiums earned assumed by the reinsurance subsidiary from Employers Mutual amounted to $135.2 million, $129.6
million and $122.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The reinsurance subsidiary ceded premiums of $5.1 million,
$10.8 million and $10.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, to Employers Mutual as payment for the inter-company
reinsurance program. Losses and settlement expenses assumed by the reinsurance subsidiary from Employers Mutual
amounted to $90.9 million, $77.5 million and $79.5 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Losses and settlement
expenses ceded to Employers Mutual under the inter-company reinsurance program totaled ($467,000), $622,000 and
($720,000) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
It is customary in the reinsurance business for the assuming company to compensate the ceding company for the
acquisition expenses incurred in the generation of the business. Commissions incurred by the reinsurance subsidiary under the
quota share agreement with Employers Mutual amounted to $27.4 million, $27.3 million and $25.6 million in 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively.
The net foreign currency exchange gains assumed by the reinsurance subsidiary from Employers Mutual were $367,000
in 2016, $386,000 in 2015 and $1.0 million in 2014. The total amount of net foreign currency exchange gains assumed by the
reinsurance subsidiary, including the business written on a direct basis outside the quota share agreement, were $356,000 in
2016, $898,000 in 2015 and $2.2 million in 2014.
