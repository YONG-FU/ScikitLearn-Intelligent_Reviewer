commissions, and prepaid reinsurance premiums as of December 31, 2016. This presentation differs from the presentation

(1) MRB is composed of Employers Mutual and four other unaffiliated mutual insurance companies. MRB is backed by the
financial strength of the five member companies. Three of the other member companies have an “A” (Excellent) rating
and the fourth has a “B++” (Good) rating from AM. Best.
(2) Amounts recoverable reﬂect the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ aggregate pool participation percentage of
amounts ceded to these organizations by Employers Mutual in connection with its role as “service carrier.” Under these
arrangements, Employers Mutual writes business for these organizations on a direct basis and then cedes the business
(typically at 100 percent) to these organizations. Credit risk associated with these amounts is minimal as all companies
participating in these organizations are responsible for the liabilities of such organizations on a pro rata basis.
(3) The total amount recoverable at December 31, 2016 represents $20.7 million in unpaid losses and settlement expenses,
$662,000 in unpaid contingent commissions, and $9.3 million in prepaid reinsurance premiums. Employers Mutual settles
with the pool participants (monthly) and the reinsurance subsidiary (quarterly) ceded paid losses and settlement expenses
under the reinsurance contracts and provides full credit for the ceded paid losses and settlement expenses generated during
the period (not just the collected portion). As a result, Employers Mutual's recoverable for paid losses and settlement
expenses represents, to the Company, an off-balance sheet arrangement with an unconsolidated entity that results in credit—
risk exposure that is not reﬂected in the Company’s financial statements. See note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of off-balance sheet credit exposures.
