The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) utilizes a risk-based capital model to help state regulators
assess the capital adequacy of insurance companies and identify insurers that are in, or are perceived as approaching, ﬁnancial
difficulty. This model establishes minimum capital needs based on the risks applicable to the operations of the individual
insurer. The risk-based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies measure three major areas of
risk: asset risk, credit risk and underwriting risk. Companies having less statutory surplus than required by the risk-based
capital requirements are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention, depending on the severity of the
inadequacy. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of $526.8
million, which is well in excess of the minimum risk-based capital requirement of $87.3 million.
