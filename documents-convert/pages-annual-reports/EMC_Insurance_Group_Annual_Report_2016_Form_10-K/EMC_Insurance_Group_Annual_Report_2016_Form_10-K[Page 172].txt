The participants in the pooling agreement are subject to guaranty fund assessments by states in which they write
business. Guaranty fund assessments are used by states to pay policyholder liabilities of insolvent insurers domiciled in those
states. Many states allow assessments to be recovered through premium tax oﬁsets. The Company has accrued estimated
guaranty fund assessments of $85 1,000 and $912,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Premium tax offsets of
$1.0 million and $1.1 million, which are related to prior guarantee fund payments and current assessments, have been accrued
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The guaranty fund assessments are expected to be paid over the next two
years and the premium tax offsets are expected to be realized within ten years of the payments. The participants in the pooling
agreement are also subject to second-injury fund assessments, which are designed to encourage employers to employ workers
with pre-existing disabilities. The Company has accrued estimated second—injury fund assessments of $1.9 million and $1.9
million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The second-injury fund assessment accruals are based on projected
loss payments. The periods over which the assessments will be paid is not known.
The participants in the pooling agreement have purchased annuities from life insurance companies, under which the
claimant is payee, to fund future payments that are fixed pursuant to specific claim settlement provisions. The Company’s
share of case loss reserves eliminated by the purchase of those annuities was $110,000 at December 31, 2016. The Company
had a contingent liability for the aggregate guaranteed amount of the annuities of $ 1 83,000 at December 31, 2016 should the
issuers of those annuities fail to perform. The probability of a material loss due to failure of performance by the issuers of these
annuities is considered remote.
The Company and Employers Mutual and its other subsidiaries are parties to numerous lawsuits arising in the normal
course of the insurance business. The Company believes that the resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse
effect on its financial condition or its results of operations. The companies involved have established reserves which are
believed adequate to cover any potential liabilities arising out of all such pending or threatened proceedings.
