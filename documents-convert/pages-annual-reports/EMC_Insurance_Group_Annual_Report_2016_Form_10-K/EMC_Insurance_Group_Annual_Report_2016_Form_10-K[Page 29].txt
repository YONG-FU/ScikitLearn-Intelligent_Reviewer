Year ended December 31, 2016
Property and casualty insurance segment
For the property and casualty insurance segment, the December 31, 2016 estimate of loss and settlement expense
reserves for accident years 2015 and prior decreased $30.0 million from the estimate at December 31, 2015. This decrease
represents 6.2 percent of the December 31, 2015 carried reserves. During the third quarter of 20 16, management implemented
a new reserving methodology for the determination of direct bulk reserves in the property and casualty insurance segment. The
new methodology produces speciﬁc line of business and accident year estimated ultimate loss and allocated settlement expense
amounts based on explicit loss frequency and severity assumptions. The previous methodology used one process to determine
the aggregate amount of IBNR loss and settlement expense reserves, and a separate process to allocate those reserves to the
various accident years. The implementation of the new reserving methodology did not have a material impact on total carried
reserves for the property and casualty insurance segment, however, there was some movement of allocated settlement expense
reserves to IBNR loss reserves, and a reallocation of loss and allocated settlement expense reserves by accident year to align
those reserves with the estimated ultimate loss and allocated settlement expense ratios. In connection with this reallocation of
reserves by accident year, approximately $5.6 million of IBNR loss and allocated settlement expense reserves were moved
from prior accident years to the current accident year in multiple lines of business. This reduction in prior accident years'
reserves is reported as favorable development; however, this development is "mechanical in nature", and did not have any
impact on earnings because the total amount of carried reserves did not change. The following table displays development on
prior years' reserves by line of business and type of reserve.

The favorable development reported for 2016 is generally attributed to lower explicit loss frequency and severity
assumptions underlying the loss and allocated settlement expense reserves carried at year-end 2016 than the implicit
assumptions underlying the reserves carried at year-end 2015. The favorable development associated with the loss and
allocated settlement expense reserves total $27.3 million, with $10.4 million coming from favorable loss reserve development
and $16.9 million coming from favorable allocated settlement expense reserve development.
Favorable development on loss and allocated settlement expense reserves represents 91 percent of the property and
casualty insurance segment’s total reported favorable development of $30.0 million. The following table displays the
development experienced in 2016 on reported and unreported loss reserves and allocated settlement expense reserves for the
five most recent accident years, by line of business.
