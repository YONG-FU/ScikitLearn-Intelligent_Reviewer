Total settlement expense reserves developed favorably in 2014 by $6.5 million. Approximately 87 percent of the
favorable development was attributed to defense and cost containment expenses. The reserves associated with these expenses
were established in bulk, and were allocated to the various accident years in proportion to the accident year distribution of the
underlying loss reserves. During 2013, the underlying loss reserves experienced favorable development, which generated
favorable development in the settlement expense reserves. However, the portion of this reserve associated with asbestos claims
experienced adverse development of $ 1 .2 million due to additional strengthening. Changes in the IBNR loss reserve and bulk
case loss reserve accident year allocation factors accounted for $749,000 of the favorable development in the defense and cost
containment expense reserves. The remaining 13 percent of favorable development was attributed to adjusting and other
expenses (i.e., internal claims department, independent adjuster and miscellaneous settlement expenses). Differences in the
allocation factors used to distribute the reserves for these expenses at year-end 2014 compared to year-end 2013 generated
$716,000 of favorable development. The majority of the remaining favorable development resulted from settlement expense
payments that were lower than anticipated in the payment patterns used in the December 31, 2013 accident year allocations.
Prior accident years” reserves for non-voluntary assumed business developed favorably by $346,000, attributed primarily
to assigned risk pools.
The above results reﬂect prior accident year reserve development on a direct and assumed basis. During 2013, ceded
losses and settlement expenses for prior accident years decreased $4.2 million. This decrease in reinsurance recoveries was
reported as adverse development.
Reinsurance segment
For the reinsurance segment, the December 31, 2014 estimate of loss and settlement expense reserves for accident years
2013 and prior decreased $12.7 million from the estimate at December 31, 2013. This decrease represented 6.9 percent of the
December 31, 2013 carried reserves. The HORAD portion of the book experienced favorable development of approximately
$11.8 million, while MRB experienced favorable development of approximately $833,000. MRB accident year 2013
experienced adverse development of $277,000. This adverse development was more than offset by favorable development on
accident years 2011 ($237,000) and 2009 ($638,000), plus favorable development on most of the remaining prior accident
years. For the HORAD book of business, accident years 2010 and prior accounted for approximately 80 percent of the
favorable development, with less significant amounts of favorable development occurring in most of the remaining prior
accident years. Development for accident year 2013 was an adverse $1.8 million due to reserve strengthening. The increase in
favorable development in the HORAD book of business in 2014 compared to 2013 was greater than expected, and was driven
mostly by a reduction of IBNR loss reserves for accident years 2010 and prior because the amount previously carried was no
longer indicated in the actuarial analysis.
