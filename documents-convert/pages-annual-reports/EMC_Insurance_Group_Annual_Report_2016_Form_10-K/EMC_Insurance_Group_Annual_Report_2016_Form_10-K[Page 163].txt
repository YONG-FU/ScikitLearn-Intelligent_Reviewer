See note 8 for a discussion on fair value measurement. Following is a brief description of the various pricing techniques
used for the asset classes of Employers Mutual ’s VEBA trust.
- Money Market Fund: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Under this method, investments
purchased at a discount or premium are valued by accreting or amortizing the difference between the original
purchase price and maturity value of the issue over the period to maturity. The net asset value of each share held by
the trust at year-end was $1.00.
- Mutual Funds: Valued at the net asset value of shares held by the trust at year-end. For purposes of calculating the
net asset value, portfolio securities and other assets for which market quotes are readily available are valued at fair
value. Fair value is generally determined on the basis of last reported sales prices, or if no sales are reported, based
on quotes obtained from a quotation reporting system, established market makers, or independent pricing services.
- ETF: Valued at the closing price from the applicable exchange.
- Life Insurance Contract: Valued at the cash surrender value, which approximates fair value.
