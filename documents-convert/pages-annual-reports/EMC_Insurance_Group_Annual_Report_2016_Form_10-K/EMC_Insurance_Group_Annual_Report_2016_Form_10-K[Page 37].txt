No changes were made in the key actuarial assumptions utilized to estimate loss and settlement expense reserves during
2014, including the "expected loss ratios" utilized for prior contract years. The "expected loss ratios" utilized for the 2014
contract year were based on an extensive actuarial analysis of trended historic ultimate loss ratios based on current-level earned
premiums. Where applicable, new contract loss information or loss histories were also incorporated into the selection process.
Compared to the 2013 contract year selections, the property per risk "expected loss ratios" increased moderately. The casualty
excess and property/casualty global pro rata "expected loss ratios" decreased slightly from the 2013 selections.
Asbestos and Environmental Claims
The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental-related claims associated with the insurance business written
by the parties to the pooling agreement and the reinsurance business assumed from Employers Mutual by the reinsurance
subsidiary. With regard to the assumed reinsurance business, however, all asbestos and environmental exposures related to
1980 and prior accident years are retained by Employers Mutual.
Estimating loss and settlement expense reserves for asbestos and environmental claims is very difficult due to the many
uncertainties surrounding these types of claims. These uncertainties exist because the assignment of responsibility varies
widely by state and claims often emerge long after a policy has expired, which makes assignment of damages to the appropriate
party and to the time period covered by a particular policy diﬁicult. In establishing reserves for these types of claims,
management monitors the relevant facts concerning each claim, the current status of the legal environment, social and political
conditions, and the claim history and trends within the Company and the industry.
