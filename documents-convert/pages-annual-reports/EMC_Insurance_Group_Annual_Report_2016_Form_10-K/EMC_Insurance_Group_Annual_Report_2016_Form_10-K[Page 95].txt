The property and casualty insurance segment's loss and settlement expense ratios for 2015 and 2014 reﬂected $13.8
million (3.1 percent of earned premiums) and $8.1 million (1.9 percent of earned premiums), respectively, of reported favorable
development on prior years' reserves; however, these amounts included $423,000 and $2.2 million, respectively, of favorable
development that resulted solely from changes in the allocation of bulk reserves between the current and prior accident years,
and therefore had no impact on net income. Net income was only impacted by changes in the total amount of carried reserves.
The loss and settlement expense ratio for the reinsurance segment decreased to 64.1 percent in 2015 from 73.9 percent in
2014. This decrease reﬂected a decline in both reported large losses (losses greater than $100,000) and catastrophe and storm
losses, as well as a significant increase in the amount of favorable reserve development experienced on prior years' reserves.
Results for 2015 included $4.1 million of catastrophe and storm losses from the Tianjin, China explosion, which was net of
$400,000 of reinsurance recovery under the excess of loss reinsurance protection provided by Employers Mutual.
Approximately $500,000 of this loss was from the MRB book of business and was reﬂected in the pro rata property line of
business, while the remaining $3.6 million of this loss was reﬂected in the excess of loss property line of business (accounted
for approximately 3.5 and 5.6 percentage points of the loss and settlement expense ratios reported for the pro rata property and
excess of loss property lines of business, respectively). The elevated loss and settlement expense ratio reported for the excess
of loss liability line of business was attributed to an increase in reported losses for contract years 2010 through 2014, and a
corresponding increase in the amount of bulk IBNR loss reserves allocated to these relatively immature years of this long-tailed
coverage. Two large reductions in carried reserves implemented during 2015 had an impact on the loss and settlement expense
ratios reported for two lines of business. First, revised ultimate loss ratio information was received for several contract years
from the ceding company for the offshore energy and liability proportional account, which reduced the carried amount of IBNR
loss reserves. This reduction in IBNR loss reserves, coupled with the decrease in IBNR loss reserves resulting from the
downward adjustment in expected ultimate premiums on this account (see discussion above), produced a small negative
amount of incurred losses and settlement expenses in the pro rata marine line of business, and a corresponding negative loss
and settlement expense ratio. Second, a large estimated loss reserve that was established on a German account in the fourth
quarter of 20 14 was taken down because of favorable development contained in an account statement received in 2015. This
resulted in a lower than normal loss and settlement expense ratio in the multiline line of business. In addition to the two large
reductions in carried reserves noted above, the favorable development experienced on prior years’ reserves reﬂected a reduction
in IBNR loss reserves established for the 2014 contract year that could no longer be justified. Catastrophe and storm losses
accounted for 12.0 percentage points of the loss and settlement expense ratio in 2015, which was lower than both the 14.4
percentage points reported in 2014 and the most recent 10-year average of 13.0 percentage points.
The reinsurance segment's loss and settlement expense ratio for 2015 reﬂected $21.3 million (17.3 percent of earned
premiums) of reported favorable development on prior years' reserves; however, this amount included $1.0 million of adverse
development that resulted solely from changes in the allocation of bulk reserves between the current and prior accident years,
and therefore had no impact on net income. Net income was only impacted by changes in the total amount of carried reserves.
Acquisition and other expenses
Acquisition and other expenses increased 7.8 percent to $178.3 million in 2015 from $165.4 million in 2014. The
acquisition expense ratio increased to 31.3 percent in 2015 from 30.6 percent in 2014. Acquisition and other expenses reported
for both years included net periodic postretirement benefit income resulting from the amortization of a large prior service credit
that resulted from an amendment of Employers Mutual's postretirement medical plan in the fourth quarter of 2013. This prior
service credit was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the fourth quarter of 20 13, and was being
amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into net income over a period of 10 years. The increase in the
2015 ratio was attributed to a combination of higher technology costs, increased pension expense, and an increase in variable
expenses such as contingent commissions and bonus accruals that are based on the improved underwriting results reported in
2015.
For the property and casualty insurance segment, the acquisition expense ratio increased to 32.9 percent in 2015 from
32.3 percent in 2015. The higher acquisition expense ratio in 2015 was primarily attributed to higher technology costs,
increased pension expense, and an increase in the variable expense categories of contingent commissions and bonus accruals.
Policyholders' dividend expense, another variable expense based on the underwriting results of some individual policies and the
safety dividend groups, declined significantly and thus limited the increase in the acquisition expense ratio.
For the reinsurance segment, the acquisition expense ratio increased to 25.1 percent in 2015 from 24.3 percent in
2014. This increase was primarily attributed to higher contingent commission expense on the offshore energy and liability
proportional account. Growth in pro rata business, which carried higher commission rates than excess of loss business, also
contributed to the increase in the ratio.
