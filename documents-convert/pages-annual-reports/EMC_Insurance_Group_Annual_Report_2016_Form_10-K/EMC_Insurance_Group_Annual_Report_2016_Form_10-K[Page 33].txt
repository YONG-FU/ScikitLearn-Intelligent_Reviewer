Total settlement expense reserves developed favorably in 2015 by $7.9 million. Approximately 73.0 percent of the
favorable development is attributed to defense and cost containment expenses. The reserves associated with these expenses
were established in bulk, and were allocated to the various accident years in proportion to the accident year distribution of the
underlying loss reserves. During 2015, the underlying loss reserves experienced favorable development, which generated
favorable development in the settlement expense reserves. However, the portion of this reserve associated with asbestos and
environmental claims experienced adverse development of $1.6 million due to additional reserve strengthening necessitated by
the continuing emergence of asbestos claims at a rate not previously anticipated. Changes in the IBNR loss reserve and bulk
case loss reserve accident year allocation factors accounted for $239,000 of the favorable development in the defense and cost
containment expense reserves. The remaining 27.0 percent of favorable development was attributed to adjusting and other
expenses (i.e., internal claims department, independent adjuster and miscellaneous settlement expenses). Differences in the
allocation factors used to distribute the reserves for these expenses at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014 generated
$234,000 of adverse development. The majority of the remaining favorable development resulted from settlement expense
payments that were lower than anticipated in the payment patterns used in the December 31, 2014 accident year allocations.
Prior accident years” reserves for non-voluntary assumed business developed favorably by $464,000, attributed primarily
to assigned risk pools.
The above results reﬂect prior accident year reserve development on a direct and assumed basis. During 2015, ceded
losses and settlement expenses for prior accident years increased $1.6 million. This increase in reinsurance recoveries is
reported as favorable development.
Reinsurance segment
For the reinsurance segment, the December 31, 2015 estimate of loss and settlement expense reserves for accident years
2014 and prior decreased $21.3 million from the estimate at December 31, 2014. This decrease represented 10.8 percent of the
December 31, 2014 carried reserves. No changes were made in the key actuarial assumptions utilized to estimate loss and
settlement expense reserves during 2015, however, the accident year allocation factors applied to IBNR loss reserves were
revised during 2015. This change resulted in the movement of $1.0 million of reserves from the current accident year to prior
accident years, and hence, was reported as adverse development on prior years’ reserves. The HORAD portion of the book
experienced favorable development of approximately $18.1 million, while MRB experienced favorable development of
approximately $3.2 million.
