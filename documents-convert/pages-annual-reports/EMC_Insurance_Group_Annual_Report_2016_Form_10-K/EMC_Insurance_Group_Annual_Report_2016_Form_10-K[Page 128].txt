Development on prior years’ reserves resulting solely from changes in the allocation of bulk reserves between the current
and prior accident years does not have an impact on earnings. This is due to the fact that such development is simply a
mathematical by-product of the mechanical process used to reallocate bulk reserves to the various accident years. Earnings are
only impacted by changes in the total amount of carried reserves.
The following table presents the reported amounts of favorable development experienced on prior years’ reserves and the
portion of the reported development amounts that resulted solely from changes in the allocation of bulk reserves between the
current and prior accident years (no impact on earnings). The result is an approximation of the implied amounts of favorable
development that had an impact on earnings.
