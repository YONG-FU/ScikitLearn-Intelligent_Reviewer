IMPACT OF INFLATION
Inﬂation has a widespread effect on the Company’s results of operations, primarily through increased losses and
settlement expenses. The Company considers inﬂation, including social inﬂation that reﬂects an increasingly litigious society
and increasing jury awards, when setting loss and settlement expense reserve amounts. Premiums are also affected by inﬂation,
although they are often restricted or delayed by competition and the regulatory rate-setting environment.
