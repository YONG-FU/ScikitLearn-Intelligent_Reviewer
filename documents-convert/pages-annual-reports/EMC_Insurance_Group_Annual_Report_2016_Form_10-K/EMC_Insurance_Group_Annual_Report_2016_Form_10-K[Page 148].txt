A small number of the Company’s securities are not priced by the independent pricing service. Two of these are equity
securities (one at December 31, 2015) that are reported as Level 3 fair value measurements since no reliable observable inputs
are used in their valuations. The largest of these equity security holdings is in a privately placed non-redeemable convertible
preferred stock investment in a technology company that Employers Mutual intends to work closely with in its data analytics
activities. Due to the recent purchase of this security in November, 2016, this security is currently carried at its acquisition
cost, which is presumed to be equivalent to fair value. The other equity security, a much smaller holding, continues to be
reported at the fair value obtained from the Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC. The SVO establishes a per share
price for this security based on an annual review of that company’s financial statements, typically performed during the second
quarter. The other securities not priced by the Company’s independent pricing service at December 31, 2016 include nine fixed
maturity securities (seven at December 31, 2015). Two of these ﬁxed maturity securities, classified as Level 3 fair value
measurements, are corporate securities that convey premium tax benefits and are not publicly traded. The fair values for these
securities are based on discounted cash ﬂow analyses. The other fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 fair value
measurements. The fair values for these ﬁxed maturity securities were obtained from either the SVO, the Company’s
investment custodian, or the Company's investment department using similar pricing techniques as the Company's independent
pricing service.
