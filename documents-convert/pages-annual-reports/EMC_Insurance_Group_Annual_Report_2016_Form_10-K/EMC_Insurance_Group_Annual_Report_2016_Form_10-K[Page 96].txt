Investment results
Net investment income decreased 1.9 percent to $45.6 million in 2015 from $46.5 million in 2014. Net investment
income for 2014 included approximately $442,000 that resulted from the early payoff of a commercial mortgage-backed
security that was purchased at a significant discount to par value, which accelerated the accretion of the discount to par value
and therefore increased investment income. Excluding this amount, net investment income declined approximately 1.0 percent.
Current interest rate levels remained below the average book yield of the fixed maturity portfolio, and were therefore likely to
continue to limit future growth in net investment income. The average coupon rate on the ﬁxed maturity portfolio, excluding
interest-only securities, remained relatively steady at 3.9 percent since December 31, 2014, but was down slightly from 4.0
percent at December 31, 2013. The effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio, excluding interest-only securities, also
remained steady at 4.6 at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Company’s equity portfolio produced dividend income of $5.6
million and $6.0 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company reported net realized investment gains of $6.2 million in 2015 compared to $4.3 million in 2014.
Included in these amounts were $1.5 million and $2.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of realized losses attributed to
declines in the carrying value of a limited partnership that the Company first invested in during 2014 to help protect it from a
sudden and significant decline in the value of its equity portfolio (an equity tail-risk hedging strategy). The Company
recognized "other-than-temporary" impairment losses of $1.5 million and $878,000 during 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
vast majority of these impairment losses were recognized on securities held in the Company's equity portfolio.
Other income and interest expense
Included in other income was foreign currency exchange gains and losses recognized on the reinsurance segment’s
foreign currency denominated reinsurance business. The reinsurance segment had foreign currency exchange gains of
$898,000 and $2.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Income tax
Income tax expense increased 96.9 percent to $21.5 million in 2015 from $10.9 million in 2014. The effective tax rate
for 2015 was 30.0 percent, compared to 26.7 percent in 2014. The primary contributor to the differences between these
effective tax rates and the United States federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent was tax-exempt interest income earned.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash ﬂows to meet cash obligations. The Company
had positive cash ﬂows from operations of $83.4 million in 2016, $85.6 million in 2015 and $91.8 million in 2014. The
Company typically generates substantial positive cash ﬂows from operations because cash from premium payments is generally
received in advance of cash payments made to settle claims. These positive cash ﬂows provide the foundation of the
Company’s asset/liability management program and are the primary driver of the Company’s liquidity. The Company invests
in high quality, liquid securities to match the anticipated payments of losses and settlement expenses of the underlying
insurance policies. Because the timing of the losses is uncertain, the majority of the portfolio is maintained in short to
intermediate maturity securities that can be easily liquidated or that generate adequate cash ﬂow to meet liabilities.
The Company is a holding company whose principal asset is its investment in its property and casualty insurance
subsidiaries and its reinsurance subsidiary (“insurance subsidiaries”). As a holding company, the Company is dependent upon
cash dividends from its insurance subsidiaries to meet all its obligations, including cash dividends to stockholders and the
funding of the Company’s stock repurchase program. State insurance regulations restrict the maximum amount of dividends
insurance companies can pay without prior regulatory approval. The maximum amount of dividends that the insurance
subsidiaries can pay to the Company in 2017 without prior regulatory approval is approximately $52.7 million. The Company
received $9.7 million, $9.2 million and $378,000 of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries and paid cash dividends to its
stockholders totaling $16.2 million, $14.2 million and $12.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
