The fair values of fixed maturity securities declined during 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest rates. Most of
the securities that are in an unrealized loss position are considered investment grade by credit rating agencies. Because
management does not intend to sell these securities, does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before recovery,
and believes it will collect the amounts due on these securities, it was determined that these securities were not “other-than-
temporarily” impaired at December 31, 2016.
No individual equity security accounted for a material amount of unrealized losses. Because the Company has the
ability and intent to hold these securities for a reasonable amount of time to allow for recovery, it was determined that these
securities were not “other-than-temporarily” impaired at December 31, 2016.
All of the Company’s preferred stock holdings that are in an unrealized loss position are perpetual preferred stocks. The
Company evaluates these perpetual preferred stocks with unrealized losses for “other-than—temporary” impairment similar to
ﬁxed maturity securities since they have debt-like characteristics such as periodic cash ﬂows in the form of dividends and call
features, are rated by rating agencies and are priced like other long-term callable fixed maturity securities. There was no
evidence of any credit deterioration in the issuers of the preferred stocks and the Company does not intend to sell these
securities before recovery, nor does it believe it will be required to sell these securities before recovery; therefore, it was
determined that these securities were not "other-than-temporarily" impaired at December 31, 2016.
