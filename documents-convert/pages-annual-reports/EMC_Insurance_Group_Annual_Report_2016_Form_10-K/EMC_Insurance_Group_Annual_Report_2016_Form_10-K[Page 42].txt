Property and Casualty Insurance and Reinsurance
The Company’s portion of premiums written ceded (unaﬁiliated and excluding premiums ceded to mandatory pools) by
the property and casualty insurance segment and the reinsurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 is presented
below. Reinsurance coverage for the property and casualty insurance segment is often purchased in layers, and an individual
reinsurer may participate in more than one type of coverage and at various layers within the coverages. Since each layer of
coverage is priced separately, with the lower layers being more expensive than the upper layers, a reinsurer’s overall
participation in a reinsurance program does not necessarily correspond to the amount of premiums it receives. The premium
amounts ceded by the reinsurance subsidiary reﬂect the purchase of additional reinsurance protection from external parties and
fronting transactions handled through the quota share agreement, and excludes premiums written ceded to Employers Mutual
under the inter-company reinsurance program.
