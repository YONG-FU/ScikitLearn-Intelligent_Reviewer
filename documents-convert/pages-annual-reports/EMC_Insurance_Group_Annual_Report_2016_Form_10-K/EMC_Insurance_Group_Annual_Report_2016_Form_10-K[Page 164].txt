Employers Mutual uses Global Portfolio Strategies, Inc. to advise on the asset allocation strategy for its qualified
pension plan. The asset allocation strategy and process of Global Portfolio Strategies, Inc. uses a diversified allocation of
equity, debt and real estate exposures that is customized to the plan’s payment risk and return targets.
Global Portfolio Strategies, Inc. reviews the plan’s assets and liabilities in relation to expectations of long-term market
performance and liability development to determine the appropriate asset allocation. The data for the contributions and
emerging liabilities is provided from the plan’s actuarial valuation, while the current asset and monthly benefit payment data is
provided by the plan record keeper.
Following is a brief description of the pricing techniques used for the asset classes of Employers Mutual’s qualified
pension plan.
- Pooled Separate Accounts: Each of the funds held by the Plan is in a pooled or commingled investment vehicle that
is maintained by the fund sponsor, each with many investors. The Plan asset is represented by a “unit of account”
and a per unit value, whose value is the accumulated value of the underlying investments less liabilities. The
sponsor of the fund specifies the source(s) used for the underlying investment asset prices and the protocol used to
value each fund.
In accordance with ASU 2015-07, a fair value hierarchy table is not included here since all of the Plan's investments are
measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient, which are not classified in the
fair value hierarchy. Presented below are the fair values of assets held in Employers Mutual's defined benefit retirement plan:

balance sheet amounts) which are included in the relevant tables and disclosures contained in this footnote.
