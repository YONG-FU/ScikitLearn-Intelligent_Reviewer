3. REINSURANCE
The parties to the pooling agreement cede insurance business to other insurers in the ordinary course of business for the
purpose of limiting their maximum loss exposure through diversification of their risks. In its consolidated financial statements,
the Company treats risks to the extent they are reinsured as though they were risks for which the Company is not liable.
However, insurance ceded by the pool participants does not relieve their primary liability as the originating insurers.
Employers Mutual evaluates the ﬁnancial condition of the reinsurers of the parties to the pooling agreement and monitors
concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers to
minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, amounts recoverable from nonaffiliated reinsurers (two in 2016 and three in 2015)
totaled $10.4 million and $12.7 million respectively, which represents a significant portion of the total prepaid reinsurance
premiums and reinsurance receivables for losses and settlement expenses. Included in these balances are amounts due from the
MRB underwriting association, of which the Company (through Employers Mutual) is a member with other unaﬁiliated
reinsurers. All members of MRB have joint and several liability for MRB's obligations. Also included in these balances is the
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ aggregate pool participation percentage of amounts ceded by Employers Mutual
to organizations on a mandatory basis. Credit risk associated with these amounts are minimal, as all companies participating in
the organizations are responsible for the liabilities of the organizations on a pro rata basis.
The effect of reinsurance on premiums written and earned, and losses and settlement expenses incurred, for the three
years ended December 31, 2016 is presented below. The classification of the assumed and ceded reinsurance amounts between
affiliates and nonafﬁliates is based on the participants in the underlying reinsurance agreements, and is intended to provide an
understanding of the actual source of the reinsurance activities. This presentation differs from the classifications used in the
consolidated financial statements, where all amounts ﬂowing through the pooling and quota share agreements and inter-
company reinsurance programs with Employers Mutual are reported as “affiliated” balances.
