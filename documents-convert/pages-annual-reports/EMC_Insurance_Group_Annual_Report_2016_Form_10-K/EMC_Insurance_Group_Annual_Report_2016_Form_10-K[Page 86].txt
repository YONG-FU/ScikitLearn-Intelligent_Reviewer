1 Large losses are defined as reported current accident year losses greater than $500 for the EMC Insurance Companies' pool,
excluding catastrophe and storm losses. Under the property and casualty insurance segment's prior reserving methodology,
large losses had a direct impact on earnings. Under the new reserving methodology, large losses are taken into consideration
when establishing the current accident year ultimate estimates of losses, but there is no longer a direct relationship between
large losses and earnings. As a result, it is no longer meaningful to report large losses separately.
The following table presents the reported amounts of favorable development experienced on prior yearsâ€™ reserves and the
portion of the reported development amounts that resulted from the reallocation of direct bulk reserves from prior accident
years to the current accident year in the property and casualty insurance segment (no impact on earnings). In 2016, the
reallocation of reserves resulted from the implementation of a new reserving methodology for the determination of bulk
reserves. In 2015 and 2014, the reallocation of reserves resulted from revisions to the accident year allocation factors used in
the prior reserving methodology. The result is an approximation of the implied amount of favorable development that had an
impact on earnings.
