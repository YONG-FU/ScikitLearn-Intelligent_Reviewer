Variability of loss and settlement expense reserves
The Company does not determine a range of estimates for all components of the loss and settlement expense reserve at
the time the reserves are established. During each quarter, however, an actuarially determined range of estimates is developed
for the major components of the loss and settlement expense reserves as of the preceding quarter-end. All reserves are
reviewed with the exception of reserves for involuntary workers’ compensation pools, which are set by the National Council on
Compensation Insurance (N CCI) and are assumed to be adequate (the impact of potential variability of this segment on overall
reserve adequacy is considered immaterial). Shown below are the actuarially determined ranges of reserve estimates as of
December 31, 2016 along with the statutory-basis carried reserves, which are displayed net of ceded reinsurance. The GAAP-
basis loss and settlement expense reserves contained in the Company’s financial statements are reported gross of ceded
reinsurance, and contain a small number of adjustments from the statutory-basis amounts presented here. The last two columns
display the estimated after-tax impact on earnings if the reserves were moved to the high end-point or low end-point of the
ranges.

The precise location of total carried reserves within the actuarial range is unknown at the time the reserves are
established because the actuarial evaluation of reserve adequacy is conducted after the establishment of the reserves.
Changes in loss and settlement expense reserve estimates of prior periods
Loss and settlement expense reserves are estimates at a given time of what an insurer expects to pay on incurred losses,
based on facts and circumstances then known. During the loss settlement period, which may be many years, additional facts
regarding individual claims become known, and accordingly, it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of
liability. Such changes in the reserves for losses and settlement expenses are reﬂected in net income in the year such changes
are recorded.
