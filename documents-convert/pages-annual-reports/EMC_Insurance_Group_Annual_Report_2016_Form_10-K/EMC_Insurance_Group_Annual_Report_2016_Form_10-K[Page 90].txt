Premium income
Premiums earned increased 3.9 percent to $592.4 million in 2016 from $570.3 million in 2015. Despite increasingly
competitive market conditions, both segments reported an increase in premium income. Rate levels for both segments continue
to be constrained by a high level of competition, especially for quality accounts with good loss experience. Average rate level
increases were just slightly positive in the property and casualty insurance segment in 2016, while the reinsurance segment
continued to experience pricing pressure during the January 1, 2016 renewal season, when approximately 70 percent of its
business renews; however, the deterioration in pricing did slow considerably from that experienced in 2015. On an overall
basis, the new and revised inter-company reinsurance programs between the Company's insurance segments and Employers
Mutual reduced premiums earned by $5.6 million in 2016. For 2017, the cost the inter-company reinsurance programs will
decline by $730,000.
Premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased 2.1 percent to $456.5 million in 2016 from
$447.2 million in 2015. The premium amount for 2016 reﬂects $7.8 million ceded to Employers Mutual for the cost of the new
inter-company reinsurance program. Excluding this amount, premiums earned increased 3.8 percent, primarily due to growth
in insured exposures, new business, and small rate level increases on renewal business. New business premium (representing
14 percent of the pool participants’ direct written premiums) was approximately ten percent higher than in 2015. Commercial
lines accounted for most of the increase in new business premium; however, personal lines also reported an increase in new
business premium after several years of declining premium. Commercial lines new business continues to be in the desired
range of growth, and management is encouraged by the reversal in personal lines, which experienced an approximate 36
percent increase in new business premium. This large increase is based on a relatively small amount of new business premium
in 2015; however, it does reﬂect agents' and policyholders' satisfaction with the new products that were rolled out during 2016.
While management continues to seek growth in most territories, it is particularly focused on achieving the strongest growth
outside of the core Midwest market, which will help diversify the pool participants' book of business geographically, while
staying consistent with the industry and line of business mix of the existing book of business. Renewal business premium
increased approximately three percent during 2016. After factoring in the continued implementation of some mandatory rate
reductions on workers' compensation business in a few states, the overall rate change on renewal business remained positive,
but was less than one percent. Rates are expected to be mixed in 2017, with the largest rate increases expected in the troubled
commercial auto line of business. Rate decreases are expected in the workers' compensation and general liability lines of
business, and rates on most other lines of business are expected to be ﬂat or increase slightly. During 2016, the overall policy
retention rate remained strong at 86.8 percent (commercial lines at 87.0 percent and personal lines at 84.6 percent). These
retention rates approximate those reported at the end of 20 15.
Premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased 10.5 percent to $135.9 million in 2016 from $123.1 million in
2015. This increase reﬂects a $2.3 million reduction in the total cost of the revised inter-company reinsurance program with
Employers Mutual. For purposes of this comparison, the total cost of the 2016 reinsurance program includes the premium paid
to Employers Mutual ($5.1 million), as well as the cost of additional reinsurance protection purchased from external parties to
provide increased protection in peak exposure territories. During 2015, the premium paid to Employers Mutual ($10.8 million,
or 8 percent of total assumed reinsurance premiums written) included the cost of reinsurance protection purchased from
external parties by Employers Mutual for its benefit. The reinsurance subsidiary purchased $5.1 million of additional
reinsurance protection from external parties during 2016, with $3.5 million of ceded earned premium recognized in 2016.
Excluding the reduction in the cost of the revised inter-company reinsurance program with Employers Mutual, premiums
earned increased 8.6 percent, or $10.5 million; however, a $7.2 million negative premium adjustment recorded in the fourth
quarter of 20 15 is distorting this percentage increase. This premium adjustment was reported by the ceding company for the
offshore energy and liability proportional account, and reduced the ultimate amount of premiums expected to be earned for
underwriting years 2012 through 2014. Without this adjustment, and excluding the reduction in the cost of the revised inter-
company reinsurance program with Employers Mutual, premiums earned increased approximately 2.6 percent in 2016. This
increase was largely from growth in the property pro rata line of business, as well as the addition of some new domestic excess
of loss contracts. During 2015, the ceded premium associated with the inter-company reinsurance program was allocated to all
lines of business (both pro rata and excess of loss) because the premium was based on total assumed reinsurance premiums
written. Beginning in 2016, the ceded premium for the inter-company reinsurance program is a fixed amount that is allocated
to only the excess of loss line of business. The assumed reinsurance market continues to experience pricing pressure due to the
inﬂux of nontraditional capital and the lack of major catastrophic events. Pricing declines moderated somewhat during the
January 1, 2017 renewal season, as rate level declines were much lower than those experienced on January 1, 2016 renewals.
Rate decreases are currently estimated to be in the low-to-mid single digits across the excess of loss book of business.
