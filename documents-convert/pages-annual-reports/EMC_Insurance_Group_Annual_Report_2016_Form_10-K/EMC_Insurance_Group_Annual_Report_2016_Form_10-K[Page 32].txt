The favorable development of $8.5 million on previously reported claims during 2015 was an increase of $2.6 million
over the $5.9 million of favorable development reported in 2014. Five of the eight lines of business contributed to the
aggregate increase in favorable development. Commercial auto liability was the largest contributor, having $3.4 million less
adverse development during 2015 compared to 2014. The four remaining contributing lines, and the increase in favorable
development attributed to them, were; other liability ($1.8 million), commercial property ($954,000), all other lines (mostly
surety bonds) ($472,000), and auto physical damage ($316,000). Personal auto liability experienced $3.0 million less favorable
development during 2015 as the 2014 development was impacted by reserve decreases on two very large unlimited personal
injury protection claims reinsured through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association. Workers' compensation continued to
experience favorable development; however, the development was $1.0 million less than in 2014. The $28,000 of adverse
development experienced on the homeowners' line of business represented a $265,000 increase over the amount experienced
during 2014. As previously stated, this was primarily caused by a line of business redistribution of the bulk case reserve.
While the adverse development experienced in commercial auto liability remained significant, the decline from the
amount reported in 2014 was also significant. Similar to 2014, the adverse development was driven by large claim amounts
associated with a very small percentage (1.8 percent) of the total claims experiencing development of any type. The
development associated with this group of claims increased 13.0 percent, which partially offset a 293.0 percent increase in
favorable development on all other commercial auto claims experiencing development of any type in 2015. Internally
monitored claims diagnostics, such as accident year ratios of average opened to average closed claims, appeared to indicate
continued strengthening of case loss reserves for claims reported during 2015 relative to 2014. Management continued to
allocate a significant amount of time and resources on the commercial auto liability book of business, focusing on claims,
underwriting and pricing processes.
IBNR loss reserves experienced $4.3 million of adverse development, which was attributed to higher than expected loss
emergence ($5.5 million) and exposure growth ($1.9 million). These adverse development amounts were partially offset by
favorable development from changes in the IBNR accident year allocation factors ($698,000), and reserve decreases taken as
the result of scheduled reserve reviews ($2.0 million). Approximately $2.6 million of the $5.5 million of higher than expected
loss emergence was due to IBNR loss reserve strengthening in the other liability line of business necessitated by the continuing
emergence of asbestos claims at a rate not previously anticipated. Six of the eight reserving lines experienced adverse IBNR
loss reserve development, with higher than expected loss emergence being the main driver for each. The lines experiencing
adverse development included commercial property ($5.3 million), auto physical damage ($844,000), commercial auto liability
($443,000), workers' compensation ($420,000), homeowners ($381,000), and personal auto liability ($264,000). Adverse
development on the property lines of business was not totally unexpected. Favorable development was consistently observed
on reported property claims, therefore, lower levels of IBNR loss reserves were generally carried to offset perceived
redundancies. Favorable development, generally driven by lower than expected emergence and decreases in carried reserves
from scheduled reviews, was experienced in other liability ($2.8 million) and surety bonds ($596,000). The following table
displays the development experienced on IBNR loss reserves from each of these factors, by line of business:
