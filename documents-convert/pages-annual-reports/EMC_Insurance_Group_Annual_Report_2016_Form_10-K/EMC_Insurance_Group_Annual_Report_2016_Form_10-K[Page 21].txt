Employers Mutual emphasizes writing excess of loss reinsurance business in its HORAD operation and works to
increase its participation on existing contracts that have had favorable terms and/or results. Employers Mutual strives to be
ﬂexible in the types of reinsurance products it offers, but generally limits its writings to direct reinsurance business, rather than
providing retrocessional covers. The reinsurance marketplace tends to favor “across the board” participation on excess of loss
reinsurance contracts. As a result, reinsurance companies must be willing to participate on all layers oﬁered under a specific
contract in order to be considered viable reinsurers.
It is customary in the reinsurance business for the assuming company to compensate the ceding company for the
acquisition expenses incurred in the generation of the business. Commissions incurred by the reinsurance subsidiary under the
quota share agreement with Employers Mutual amounted to $27.4 million in 2016. During 2016, the reinsurance subsidiary
ceded to Employers Mutual $5.1 million of premiums under the inter-company reinsurance program. The reinsurance
subsidiary also assumes all foreign currency exchange gain/loss associated with contracts incepting on January 1, 2006 and
thereafter that are subject to the quota share agreement. The net foreign currency exchange gain assumed by the reinsurance
subsidiary through the quota share agreement in 2016 was $367,000.
Competition
Property and Casualty Insurance
The property and casualty insurance marketplace is very competitive. The pool participants compete in the United
States insurance market with numerous insurers, many of which have substantially greater ﬁnancial resources. Competition in
the types of insurance in which the pool participants are engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall
ﬁnancial strength of the insurer, industry ratings, premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, services oﬁered, speed of
claim payments, reputation and experience. Because the pool participants’ insurance products are marketed exclusively
through independent agencies, they face competition to retain qualified agencies, as well as competition within the agencies.
The pool participants also compete with direct writers, who utilize salaried employees and generally oﬁer their products at a
lower cost; exclusive agencies, who write insurance business for only one company; and to a lesser extent, internet-based
enterprises. Employers Mutual’s decentralized network of 16 branch offices allows the pool participants to enhance business
relationships with agents and customers and develop products, marketing strategies and pricing parameters targeted to
individual territories. The pool participants also utilize a company-paid trip for qualified agents and a profit-sharing plan as
incentives for the independent agencies to place high-quality insurance business with them.
Reinsurance
Employers Mutual, in writing reinsurance business through its HORAD operation, competes in the global reinsurance
market with numerous reinsurance companies, many of which have substantially greater financial resources. Competition for
reinsurance business is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of the reinsurer, industry ratings,
stability in products oﬁered and licensing status. There is a segment of the market that favors large, highly-capitalized
reinsurance companies who are able to provide “mega” line capacity for multiple lines of business.
