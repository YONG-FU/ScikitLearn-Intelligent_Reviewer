The estimated fair values of fixed maturity and equity securities is based on quoted market prices, where available. In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on a variety of valuation techniques depending on the
type of security.
Short-term investments generally include money market funds, US. Treasury bills and commercial paper. Short-term
investments are carried at fair value, which approximates cost, due to the highly liquid nature of the securities. Short-term
securities are classified as Level 1 fair value measurements when the fair values can be validated by recent trades. When recent
trades are not available, fair value is deemed to be the cost basis and the securities are classiﬁed as Level 2 fair value
measurements.
The estimated fair value of the surplus notes is derived by discounting future expected cash ﬂows at a rate deemed
appropriate. The discount rate was set at the average of current yields-to-maturity on several insurance company surplus notes
that are traded in observable markets, adjusted upward by 50 basis points to reﬂect illiquidity and perceived risk premium
differences. Other assumptions include a 25 -year term (the surplus notes have no stated maturity date) and an interest rate that
continues at the current 1.35 percent interest rate. The rate is typically adjusted every five years and is based upon the then-
current Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate for 5-year funds available to Employers Mutual.
