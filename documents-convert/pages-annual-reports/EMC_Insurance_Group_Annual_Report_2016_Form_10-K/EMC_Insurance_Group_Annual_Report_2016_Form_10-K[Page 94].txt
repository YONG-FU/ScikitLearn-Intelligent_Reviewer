Premiums earned for the property and casualty insurance segment increased 5.9 percent to $447.2 million in 2015 from
$422.4 million in 2014. The increase was primarily associated with renewal business, which increased four percent during
2015 due to a combination of rate level increases and growth in insured exposures. Renewal rates across both commercial and
personal lines of business increased approximately two percent during 2015, and were expected to continue to increase at low
single-digit levels throughout 2016 due to competition restraints. New business premium (representing 13 percent of the pool
participants’ direct written premiums) was approximately three percent higher than 2014, with an increase in commercial lines
new business premium being partially offset by a decline in personal lines new business premium. Commercial lines new
business continued to be in the desired range of growth, and was strongest outside of the core Midwest market. This growth
helped diversify the pool participants’ book of business geographically, while staying consistent with the industry and line of
business mix of the existing book of business. While retention levels for personal lines of business remained stable, new
business written premiums were down as management continued to focus on the development and implementation of its new
personal lines strategy. During 2015, the overall policy retention rate remained strong at 86.5 percent (commercial lines at 86.7
percent and personal lines at 84.8 percent). These retention rates approximated those experienced in 2014.
Premiums earned for the reinsurance segment increased 4.0 percent to $123.1 million in 2015 from $118.3 million in
2014; however, premium adjustments made in 2015 and 2014 were impacting this percentage increase. In 2015, a negative
premium adjustment of $7.2 million reported by the ceding company for the offshore energy and liability proportional account
was recorded to reduce the ultimate amount of premiums expected to be earned for underwriting years 2012 through 2014. In
2014, a $7.7 million reduction in earned but not reported premiums was recognized on pro rata accounts. Without these
adjustments, premiums earned would have increased approximately 3.3 percent. This growth was driven by new accounts,
changes in current contract structures, a decline in terminated accounts in the HORAD book of business, and an increase in pro
rata business in the MRB book of business. The premium adjustments made in 2015 and 2014 did not have a material impact
on net income because corresponding adjustments were made to IBNR loss reserves, commission expense reserves and the cost
of the excess of loss reinsurance protection. The negative premium adjustment recorded for the offshore energy and liability
proportional account, coupled with reduced participation in this account for the 2015 contract year, resulted in a $10.3 million
decline in premiums earned from this program in 2015. Competition in the reinsurance market began to increase during 2014
due to the entrance of non-traditional capital into the marketplace. This trend continued into 2015, but at a more moderate
level. As a result, total premiums earned for excess of loss business was down slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. The January
1, 2016 renewal season, when approximately 70 percent of the reinsurance segment's business renewed, saw continued pricing
pressure similar to that experienced in 2015.
Losses and settlement expenses
Losses and settlement expenses decreased 3.8 percent to $370.7 million in 2015 from $385.5 million in 2014, and the
loss and settlement expense ratio decreased to 65.0 percent in 2016 from 71.3 percent in 2014. Both segments experienced
significant improvements in their loss and settlement expense ratios during 2015, due in large part to below normal catastrophe
and storm losses and an increase in favorable reserve development. The actuarial analysis of the Company’s carried reserves at
December 31, 2015 indicated that the level of reserve adequacy was consistent with other recent evaluations. From
management’s perspective, this measure was more relevant to an understanding of the Company’s results of operations than the
composition of the underwriting results between the current and prior accident years.
The loss and settlement expense ratio for the property and casualty insurance segment decreased to 65.3 percent in 2015
from 70.6 percent in 2014. This decrease was attributed to lower catastrophe and storm losses, a decline in overall claim
frequency and continued improvement in premium rate adequacy. The decline in overall claim frequency was across many of
the major lines of business, and was partially driven by the unusually high level of losses experienced during the first quarter of
2014 due to severe winter weather. Catastrophe and storm losses accounted for 6.6 percentage points of the loss and settlement
expense ratio in 2015, down from 9.5 percentage points in 2014, and lower than the then most recent 10-year average of 9.6
percentage points. Large losses (which the Company defined as losses greater than $500,000 for the EMC Insurance
Companies' pool, excluding catastrophe losses) accounted for 7.7 percentage points of the loss and settlement expense ratio in
2015, compared to 8.4 percentage points in 2014. Included in the large loss amount reported for 2014 was $1.5 million
stemming from a fire at an adjacent building being renovated that damaged two office buildings owned by the Company's
parent, Employers Mutual. At the time of the loss, Employers Mutual was self-insured for the first $5.0 million of loss to its
campus, and the loss was subject to the EMC Insurance Companies' inter-company pooling agreement. Overall claims severity
increased during 2015, after remaining fairly steady throughout 2014. Increased claims frequency and severity was the primary
driver of the high loss and settlement expense ratios reported for the commercial auto line of business in both 2015 and 2014,
which was consistent with industry results.
