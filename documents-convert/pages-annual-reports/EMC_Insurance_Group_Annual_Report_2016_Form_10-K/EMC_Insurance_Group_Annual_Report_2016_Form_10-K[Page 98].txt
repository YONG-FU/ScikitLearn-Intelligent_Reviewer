Employers Mutual contributed $9.0 million, $4.0 million and $7.0 million to its qualified pension plan in 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively, and plans to contribute approximately $9.0 million to the qualified pension plan in 2017. The Company
reimbursed Employers Mutual $2.7 million, $1.2 million and $2.2 million for its share of the pension contributions in 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. Employers Mutual did not make any contributions to its postretirement benefit plans during 2016,
2015, or 2014, and does not expect to make any contributions in 2017 due to the plan amendment that was announced during
2013.
Capital Resources
Capital resources consist of stockholders’ equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to
support business operations. For the Company’s insurance subsidiaries, capital resources are required to support premium
writings. Regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer’s annual net premiums written to its
statutory surplus should not exceed three to one. All of the Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries were well
under this guideline at December 31, 2016.
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis,
and are subject to regulations under which the payment of dividends from statutory surplus is restricted and may require prior
approval of their domiciliary insurance regulatory authorities. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to annual
Risk Based Capital (RBC) requirements that may further impact their ability to pay dividends. RBC requirements attempt to
measure minimum statutory capital needs based upon the risks in a company’s mix of products and investment portfolio. At
December 31, 2016, the Company’s insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of $526.8 million, which is well
in excess of the minimum risk-based capital requirement of $87.3 million.
