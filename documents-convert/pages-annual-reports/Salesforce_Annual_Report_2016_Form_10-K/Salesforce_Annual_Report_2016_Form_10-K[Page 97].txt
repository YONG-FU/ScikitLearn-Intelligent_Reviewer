The unrealized loss for each individual fixed rate marketable securities was less than $115,000. The
Company does not believe any of the unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment based on
its evaluation of available evidence as of January 31, 2016. The Company expects to receive the full principal
and interest on all of these marketable securities.
Fair Value Measurement
All of the Company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency derivative contracts are
classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because the Company’s cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign
currency derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models
utilizing observable market inputs.
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation
methodologies in measuring fair value:
Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2. Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3. Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.
