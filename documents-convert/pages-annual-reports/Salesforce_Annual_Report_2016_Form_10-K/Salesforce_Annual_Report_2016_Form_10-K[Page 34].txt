Risks Relating to Our Convertible Senior Notes and Our Common Stock
The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject as to litigation.
The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. Accordingly, the
market price of our notes and common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide ﬂuctuations.
Factors affecting the market price of our notes and common stock include:
0 variations in our operating results, earnings per share, cash ﬂows from operating activities, deferred
revenue, year-over-year growth rates for individual core service offerings and other financial metrics
and non-financial metrics, and how those results compare to analyst expectations;
- variations in, and limitations of, the various ﬁnancial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts
in their research and reports about our business;
- forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future revenue and earnings per
share;
0 changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by securities analysts
that elect to follow our common stock;
0 announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances
or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;
0 announcements by us or by our competitors of mergers or other strategic acquisitions, or rumors of
such transactions involving us or our competitors;
0 announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;
0 recruitment or departure of key personnel;
0 disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems;
0 the economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;
0 trading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant
portion of our outstanding common stock;
0 the issuance of shares of common stock by us, whether in connection with an acquisition, a capital
raising transaction or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding convertible senior notes; and
0 issuance of debt or other convertible securities.
In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences uneven investor
confidence, the market price of our notes and common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business,
operating results or financial condition. The market price of our notes and common stock might also decline in
reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry even if these events do not directly
affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the
subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial
costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.
We may issue additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our
common stock, including in connection with the conversion of the notes, and thereby materially and adversely
affect the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the notes.
We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or other instruments convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock during the life of the notes. If we issue
additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into shares of our common stock, it may
materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading price of the notes.
In addition, the conversion of some or all of the notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing holders of
