Cost of revenues was $1.3 billion, or 24 percent of total revenues, for ﬁscal 2015, compared to $968.4 million,
or 24 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, an increase of $320.8 million. The increase in absolute dollars
was primarily due to an increase of $122.3 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-
based expenses, an increase of $100.6 million in service delivery costs, primarily due to our efforts to increase data
center capacity, an increase of $29.9 million in professional and outside services, an increase of $18.8 million in
allocated overhead and an increase of $44.7 million in depreciation of property and equipment, offset by a decrease
of $19.1 million in amortization of purchased intangibles. We increased our headcount by 30 percent in ﬁscal 2015
to meet the higher demand for services from our customers.
The cost of professional services and other revenues exceeded the related revenue during fiscal 2015 by
$4.8 million as compared to $10.1 million during ﬁscal 2014, primarily due to the impact of including
ExactTarget revenue for the full fiscal 2015, as described above, offset by an increase in the cost related to
professional services headcount. This investment in professional services facilitated the adoption of our service
offerings.
