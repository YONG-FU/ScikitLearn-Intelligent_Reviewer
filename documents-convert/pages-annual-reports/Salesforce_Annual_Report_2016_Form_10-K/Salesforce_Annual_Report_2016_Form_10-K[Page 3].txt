The evolution came in waves.
The mainframe.
The client server.
And the cloud.
Now, the next wave is building.
A fourth industrial revolution is here.
But the biggest change underway today is not happening in technology itself.
It’s happening to the customer.
Your customer.
Technology, mobility, and the Web have made the customer smarter, faster,
and more in control than ever before.
And they’re looking for a trusted advisor.
They want a platform they can build and shape with you into the future.
They want deep, meaningful insights.
And before they meet you, they want to meet your community.
Forthe past 17 years, our focus as a company has been on one simple thing:
the customer.
And we’re moving into the future with the same focus, bringing you
data science, analytics, and the Internet of Things to name just a few.
