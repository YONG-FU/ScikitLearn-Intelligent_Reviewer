The Age of the Customer
We believe that the convergence of cloud, social, mobile, data science and Internet of Things technologies is
fundamentally transforming how companies sell, service, market and innovate to connect with their customers.
Cloud computing has changed the way enterprise business apps are developed and deployed. Organizations
no longer need to buy and maintain their own infrastructure of servers, storage and development tools in order to
create and run business apps. Instead, companies can gain access to a variety of business apps Via an Internet
browser or mobile device on an as-needed basis, without the cost and complexity of managing the hardware or
software in-house.
Social networking has transformed the way people engage and collaborate and is accelerating the adoption
of technologies that connect people, products and brands. In addition, the proliferation of mobile phones
worldwide continues, and enterprise mobile apps are making it possible for people to conduct business from their
phones anytime and anywhere.
Progress in data science and machine learning is moving companies beyond just automating business
processes to more data-driven, predictive computing solutions. As more people and devices become connected
via the Internet of Things, mobile devices and apps, companies are unlocking insights and turning data into
meaningful actions to help them to proactively engage one-to-one with customers in real time.
By bringing together the power of cloud, social, mobile, data science and Internet of Things technologies in
our Customer Success Platform, we believe Salesforce is at the forefront of enabling companies to digitally
transform into customer-centric companies.
