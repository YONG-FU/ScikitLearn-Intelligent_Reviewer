The effects of dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted earnings/loss per
share for the years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 because we had a net loss for those periods and the
effect would have been anti-dilutive. The following table reﬂects the effect of the dilutive securities on the basic
share count used in the GAAP earnings/loss per share calculation to derive the share count used for the non-
GAAP diluted earnings per share:

(1) The effects of these dilutive securities were not included in the GAAP calculation of diluted net loss per
share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
(2) Upon maturity in fiscal 2015, the convertible 0.75% senior notes and associated warrants were settled. The
0.25% senior notes were not convertible, however, there is a dilutive effect for shares outstanding for the
fiscal 2016.

Supplemental Tax Expense (Beneﬁt) Information:
As described above, beginning in February 2014, which was the start of our fiscal 2015, we changed the
methodology used to calculate our non-GAAP tax expense. We computed and utilized a ﬁxed long-term
projected non-GAAP tax rate of 36.5 percent for fiscal 2015. We moved to this long-term projected non-GAAP
tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of
non-recurring and period-specific items. As a result, we believe that starting in fiscal 2015, providing a tabular
reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of tax expense (benefit) to the comparable GAAP measure is
not appropriate given our new methodology.
