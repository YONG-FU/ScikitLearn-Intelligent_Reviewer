Overview
We are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship
management, or CRM. We introduced our first CRM solution in February 2000, and we have since expanded our
service offerings with new editions, solutions, features and platform capabilities.
Our mission is to help our customers transform themselves into customer-centric companies by empowering
them to connect with their customers in entirely new ways. Our Customer Success Platform, including sales force
automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application
development, Internet of Things integration and our professional cloud services, provide the next— generation
platform of enterprise applications and services to enable customer success. Key elements of our strategy
include:
- strengthening our market-leading solutions;

customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services; the availability, performance and
security of our service; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved
features; our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies; successful customer adoption
and utilization of our service; acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers; the emergence
of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors; the
location of new data centers; third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms; our
ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel; and general economic conditions
which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase our services, delay the customers’
purchasing decision or affect attrition rates.
To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying
subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise License
Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party
applications on our platforms and continue to focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal. Our plans to
