Non-GAAP free cash ﬂow
We define the non-GAAP measure free cash ﬂow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less
capital expenditures. For this purpose, capital expenditures does not include our strategic investments, nor does it
include any costs or activities related to our purchase of 50 Fremont land and building, and building in
pro gress—leased facilities.
Limitations on the use of non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures
A limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating profit,
non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free cash ﬂow is that they do not have
uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including
peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP measures of non-GAAP gross
profit, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share and non-GAAP free
cash ﬂow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based expense, if we did not pay a portion of
compensation in the form of stock-based expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenues and
operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.
We compensate for these limitations by reconciling our non-GAAP financial measures to the most
comparable GAAP financial measure. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in
its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view our non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures in
conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.
