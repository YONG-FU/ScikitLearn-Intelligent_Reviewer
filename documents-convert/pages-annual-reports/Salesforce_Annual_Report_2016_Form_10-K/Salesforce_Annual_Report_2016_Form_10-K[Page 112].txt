7. Stockholders’ Equity
The Company maintains the following stock plans: the ESPP, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2014
Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Inducement Plan”). The expiration of the 1999 Stock Option Plan
(“1999 Plan”) in fiscal 2010 did not affect awards outstanding, which continue to be governed by the terms and
conditions of the 1999 Plan.
On July 10, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Inducement Plan with a reserve of 335,000 shares of
common stock for future issuance solely for the granting of inducement stock options and equity awards to new
employees, including employees of acquired companies. In addition, approximately 319,000 shares of common
stock that remained available for grant under the 2006 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Prior Inducement
Plan”) as of July 9, 2014 were added to the 2014 Inducement Plan share reserve and the Prior Inducement Plan was
terminated. Further, any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Inducement Plan
that expire, are forfeited, or are repurchased by the Company will also become available for future grant under the
2014 Inducement Plan. Termination of the Prior Inducement Plan did not affect the outstanding awards previously
issued thereunder. The 2014 Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval in reliance on the
“employment inducement exemption” provided under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
