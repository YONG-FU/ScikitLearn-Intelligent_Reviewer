General and administrative expenses were $679.9 million, or 13 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2015,
compared to $596.7 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during fiscal 2014, a increase of $83.2 million. The
increase was primarily due to an increase of $53.1 million in employee-related costs, an increase of $18.9 million
in equipment costs and an increase of $11.7 million in stock-based expense, offset by a decrease of $3.0 million
in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 9 percent in fiscal
2015 as we added personnel to support our growth.

credit facility. Interest expense, net of interest costs capitalized, was $73.2 million for fiscal 2015 and was $77.2
million during fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reduced principal balance on our 0.75%
convertible senior notes as a result of early note conversions during fiscal 2015. These notes fully matured on
January 15, 2015.

During fiscal 2015, we sold two separate portions of our undeveloped real estate, including a portion of our
perpetual parking rights, in San Francisco, California. We recognized a gain of $15.6 million during fiscal 2015,
net of closing costs, as a result of this activity.
