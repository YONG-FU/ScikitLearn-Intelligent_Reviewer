Other expense primarily consists of non-operating costs such as foreign currency transaction gains and
losses, costs associated with real estate transactions and losses on derecognition of debt. The increase in other
expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to losses totaling $10.3 million related to the extinguishment of the
0.75% Senior Notes converted by noteholders.

Effectivetaxrate............................. (23)% 35%
We reported a tax provision of $49.6 million on a pretax loss of $213.1 million, which resulted in a negative
effective tax rate of 23 percent for the fiscal 2015. We had a tax provision primarily due to income taxes in
profitable jurisdictions outside the United States, which was partially offset by tax benefits from losses incurred
by ExactTarget in certain state jurisdictions.
We recorded a tax benefit of $125.8 million with a pretax loss of $357.9 million, which resulted in an
effective tax rate of 35 percent for fiscal 2014. Due to the ExactTarget acquisition, a deferred tax liability was
established for the book-tax basis difference related to purchased intangibles. The net deferred tax liability from
acquisitions provided an additional source of income to support the realizability of our pre-existing deferred tax
assets. As a result, we released a portion of the valuation allowance that was established in fiscal 2013 and
recorded a tax benefit of $143.1 million for fiscal 2014.
We had a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as we considered our cumulative loss in
recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At January 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
totaling $2.7 billion and accounts receivable of $2.5 billion.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion during fiscal 2016 and $1.2 billion during the
same period a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities were affected by the amount of net loss adjusted
for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, loss on the conversions of convertible senior
notes, amortization of purchased intangibles from business combinations, amortization of debt discount, the
expense associated with stock-based awards, and speciﬁcally for fiscal 2016 gains related to the termination of
50 Fremont lease and the additional sales of our land in Mission Bay; and the reclassification of excess tax
benefits from employee stock plans to cash flows from financing activities; the timing of employee related costs
including commissions and bonus payments; the timing of payments against accounts payable, accrued expenses
and other current liabilities; the timing of collections from our customers, which is our largest source of operating
cash ﬂows; and changes in working capital accounts.
