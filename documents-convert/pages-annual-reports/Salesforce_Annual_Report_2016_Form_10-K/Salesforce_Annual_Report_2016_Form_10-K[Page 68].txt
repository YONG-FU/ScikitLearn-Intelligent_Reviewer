as of January 31, 2016. Our common stock did not trade at a price exceeding 130% of the conversion price of
$66.44 per share applicable to the 0.25% Senior Notes during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016.
Accordingly, the 0.25% Senior Notes were not convertible at the holders’ option for the quarter ending January 31,
2016.
In October 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides for a
$650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that matures in October 2019.
Immediately upon closing, we borrowed $300.0 million under the Credit Facility, approximately $262.5 million
of which was used to repay in full the indebtedness under our Term Loan. In March 2015, we paid down the
$300.0 million of outstanding borrowings held under the Credit Facility and related interest in full. We may use
any future borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. We may borrow amounts under the Credit Facility at any
time during the term of the Credit Agreement. We may also prepay the borrowings under the Credit Facility, in
whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions, and amounts repaid or
prepaid may be reborrowed. As of January 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were $0.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option at either a base rate formula or a LIB OR
based formula, each as set forth in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, we are obligated to pay an ongoing
commitment fee at a rate between 0.125% and 0.25%. Interest and the commitment fee are payable in arrears
quarterly.
The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a consolidated
leverage ratio covenant, a consolidated interest coverage ratio covenant, a limit on our ability to incur additional
indebtedness, dispose of assets, make certain acquisition transactions, pay dividends or distributions, and certain
other restrictions on our activities each defined specifically in the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with
the Credit Agreement’s covenants as of January 31, 2016.
In August 2014, we sold approximately 3.7 net acres of our undeveloped real estate in San Francisco for a
total of $72.5 million. Separately, in September 2014, we sold approximately 1.5 net acres of our undeveloped
real estate for a total of $125.0 million. In October 2015 , we sold approximately 8.8 net acres of undeveloped real
estate and the associated perpetual parking rights in San Francisco, California, which were classified as held for
sale. The total proceeds from the sale were $157.1 million, of which the Company received $127.1 million during
fiscal 2016 and previously received a nonrefundable deposit in the amount of $30.0 million during the fiscal
quarter ended April 30, 2014.
In February 2015 , we acquired 50 Fremont Street, a 41-story building totaling approximately
817,000 rentable square feet located in San Francisco, California (“50 Fremont”). We acquired 50 Fremont for
the purpose of expanding our global headquarters in San Francisco. See Note 4, “Business Combinations” in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total purchase price for 50 Fremont was $637.6 million. To
pay for 50 Fremont, we used $115.0 million of restricted cash and assumed a $200.0 million loan secured by the
property with the remainder paid in cash.
Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and
obligations, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. agency obligations, commercial paper, asset backed securities,
mortgage backed securities obligations, time deposits, money market mutual funds and municipal securities.
As of January 31, 2016, we have a total of $81.9 million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of certain
landlords for office space. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew
annually and expire at various dates through December 2030.
We do not have any special purpose entities, and other than operating leases for office space and computer
equipment, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
