Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company enters into foreign currency derivative contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk
that its cash ﬂows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The
Company uses forward currency derivative contracts to minimize the Company’s exposure to balances primarily
denominated in Euros, Japanese yen, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. The Company’s
foreign currency derivative contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, are used to reduce the
exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. The Company’s derivative
financial instruments program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. As of January 31, 2016 and
2015, the foreign currency derivative contracts that were not settled were recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheets.
Foreign currency derivative contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with gains
and losses recognized as other expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement or
remeasurement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. While the contract or
notional amount is often used to express the volume of foreign currency derivative contracts, the amounts
potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’
obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties.
