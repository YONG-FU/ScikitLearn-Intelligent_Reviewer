The Company will continue to monitor this matter and the related potential impacts to its financial statements.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company amended its inter-company cost-sharing arrangement to
exclude stock-based compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2016 and accordingly, the Company recognized
the related tax benefit through its tax provision. The Company also recorded a tax benefit of $30.4 million related
to the Company’s historical tax filing position, which was offset by the valuation allowance. In the above
reconciliation, most of the Altera related tax benefit was reﬂected in the foreign taxes in excess of the US.
statutory rate, which was partially offset by the change in valuation allowance.
In December 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 was signed into law,
which made permanent several business-related provisions such as the research tax credit for qualifying amounts
paid or incurred after December 31, 2014, and extended other expired provisions including bonus depreciation.
While the retroactive benefit of the research tax credits was fully offset by an increase of the Company’s
valuation allowance in fiscal 2016 tax provision, the bonus depreciation election reduced the Company’s taxable
income before considering certain excess tax benefits from stock options and vesting of restricted stock, which
correspondingly reduced U.S current tax expense by $18.9 million.
In December 2014, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 was signed into law, which retroactively
renewed expired provisions including research and development tax credits through the end of calendar year
2014. The enacted law change did not impact the Company’s fiscal 2015 tax provision as the retroactive benefit
of the research tax credits was fully offset by an increase in valuation allowance.
The Company receives certain tax incentives in Switzerland and Singapore in the form of reduced tax rates. The
tax reduction program in Switzerland expired in ﬁscal 2015, and the program in Singapore expired in ﬁscal 2016.
