Research and development expenses were $946.3 million, or 14 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016,
compared to $792.9 million, or 15 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of
$153.4 million. The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $114.0 million in employee-
related costs, an increase of $8.2 million in stock-based expense, an increase of $18.2 million in development and
test data center expense, and an increase in allocated overhead. We increased our research and development
headcount by 16 percent since January 31, 2015 in order to improve and extend our service offerings and develop
new technologies. We expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and may
increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we continue to add employees and invest in technology
to support the development of new, and improve existing, technologies and the integration of acquired
technologies.

Marketing and sales expenses were $3.2 billion, or 49 percent of total revenues, for fiscal 2016, compared to
$2.8 billion, or 51 percent of total revenues, during the same period a year ago, an increase of $482.7 million.
The increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases of $304.7 million in employee-related costs,
including amortization of deferred commissions, $112.0 million in advertising expense costs, $12.5 million in
amortization of purchased intangibles, $2.7 million stock-based expense and $40.4 million in allocated overhead.
Our marketing and sales headcount increased by 21 percent since January 31, 2015. The increase in headcount
was primarily attributable to hiring additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing
penetration within our existing customer base.

in professional and outside services. Our general and administrative headcount increased by 16 percent since
