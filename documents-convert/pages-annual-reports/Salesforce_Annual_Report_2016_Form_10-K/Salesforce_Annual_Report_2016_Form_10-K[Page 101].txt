decline in value has occurred. These investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an
inactive market and the valuation requires the Company’s judgment due to the absence of market prices and
inherent lack of liquidity.
As of January 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable debt and equity
securities was $504.5 million and $158.0 million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the non-marketable
debt and equity securities was approximately $714.1 million and $280.0 million as of January 31, 2016
and January 31, 2015, respectively. These investments are measured using the cost method of accounting,
therefore the unrealized gains of $209.6 million and $122.0 million as of January 31, 2016 and January 31, 2015,
respectively, are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
