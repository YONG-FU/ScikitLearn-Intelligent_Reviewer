Preferred Stock
The Company’s board of directors has the authority, without further action by stockholders, to issue up to
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The Company’s board of directors may designate the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights,
voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms, and number of shares constituting
any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting
dividends on the Company’s common stock, diluting the voting power of its common stock, impairing the
liquidation rights of its common stock, or delaying or preventing a change in control. The ability to issue
preferred stock could delay or impede a change in control. As of January 31, 2016 and 2015, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.
