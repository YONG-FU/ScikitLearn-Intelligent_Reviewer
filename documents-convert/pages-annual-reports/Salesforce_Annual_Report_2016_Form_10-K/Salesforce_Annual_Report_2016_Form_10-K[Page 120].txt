9. Earnings/Loss Per Share
Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the ﬁscal period. Diluted earnings/loss per share is computed by giving effect to
all potential weighted average dilutive common stock, including options, restricted stock units, warrants and the
convertible senior notes. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reﬂected in
diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share for fiscal 2016,
2015 and 2014 are the same as basic loss per share as there is a net loss in these periods and inclusion of
potentially issuable shares is anti-dilutive.
A reconciliation of the denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share is as follows
(in thousands):

The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted
earnings/loss per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The
effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings/loss per
share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in thousands):
