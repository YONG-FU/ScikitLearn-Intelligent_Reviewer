NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The Company reviews its non-marketable cost-basis investments in equity securities for other than
temporary declines in fair value based on prices recently paid for shares in that company, as well as changes in
market conditions. The carrying values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that the Company could
realize in a current transaction. The company recognized losses of $2.8 million and $4.6 million on certain
investments during the years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. During the year
ended February 28, 2014, no significant losses were recognized on similar investments.

NOTE 10—Derivative Instruments
The Company transacts business in various foreign countries and is, therefore, subject to risk of foreign
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. The Company from time to time enters into forward contracts to
economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable,
trade accounts payable and ﬁxed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency of the respective operating entity. All derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets at their respective fair market values. The Company has elected not to prepare and maintain the
documentation required to qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, changes in fair value are
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The effects of derivative instruments on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows as
of February 29, 2016 and for the year then ended (in thousands):
