functions, including information systems, finance, accounting, legal, human resources and facilities expense.

February 29, 2016 from $170.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2015. The increase in general and
administrative expenses results from increased employee compensation expenses of $13.1 million, primarily
related to additional headcount, increased facilities and information systems costs of $3.7 million and outside
services expenses of $3.9 million. General and administrative expense decreased as a percentage of revenue to
9.4% for the year ended February 29, 2016 from 9.5% for the year ended February 28, 2015.

from $8.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2015. The increase is attributable to slightly higher yields

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net decreased $8.3 million for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to
the year ended February 28, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to gains on the sale of certain equity investments
during the year ended February 28, 2015 not repeated during the year ended February 29, 2016.
Income taxes
During the year ended February 29, 2016, we recorded $75.5 million of income tax expense, which resulted
in an effective tax rate of 27.5%. Our effective tax rate of 27.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of
35.0% primarily due to the foreign tax credit, foreign income taxed at lower rates, research tax credits and the
domestic production activities deduction.The provision for income tax for the year ended February 29, 2016
consists of $41.5 million of U.S. income tax expense and $34.0 million of foreign income tax expense.
During the year ended February 28, 2015, we recorded $75.3 million of income tax expense, which resulted
in an annual effective tax rate of 29.5%. Our effective tax rate of 29.5%, differs from the U.S. federal statutory
rate of 35 .0% primarily due to the foreign tax credit, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the domestic
production activities deduction and research tax credits. The foreign tax credit and foreign tax rate differentials
were partially offset by a deemed foreign dividend. The provision for income tax for the year ended February 28,
2015 consisted of $57.2 million of U.S. income tax expense and $18.1 million of foreign income tax expense.
