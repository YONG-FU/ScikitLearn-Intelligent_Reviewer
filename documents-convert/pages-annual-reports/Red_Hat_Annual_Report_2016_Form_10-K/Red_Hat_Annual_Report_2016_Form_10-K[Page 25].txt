We have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and
acquisitions, which may be difficult to complete and integrate, disrupt our business, divert management’s
attention, adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash ﬂows or dilute
stockholder value.
As part of our business strategy, we have in the past entered into business combinations and acquisitions,
and we may continue to do so in the future. These types of transactions can increase the expense of running our
business and present significant challenges and risks, including:
- identifying acquisition targets that complement our strategic direction and technology road map;
- integrating the acquired business’ accounting, financial reporting, management, information and
information security, human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management
and reporting, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented;
- gathering full information regarding a business or technology prior to a transaction, including the
identification and assessment of liabilities, claims or other circumstances that could result in litigation or
regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected tax implications and other adverse
effects on our business;
- increasing or additional operating expenses related to the acquired business or technology;
- maintaining or establishing acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies;
° disrupting of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
- impairing relationships with our employees, partners or customers as a result of any integration of new
management and other personnel, products or technology or as a result of the changes in the competitive
landscape affected by the transaction;
- maintaining good relationships with customers or business partners of the acquired business;
° effectively evaluating talent at an acquired business or cultural challenges associated with integrating
employees from the acquired business into our organization;
- losing key employees of the acquired business;
° incorporating and further developing acquired products or technology into our offerings and maintaining
quality standards consistent with our brands;
° achieving the expected benefits of the transaction, which may include generating greater market
acceptance of our technologies, increasing our revenues or integrating the assets acquired into one or
more of our current offerings;
- incurring expenses related to the transaction;
- assuming claims and liabilities from the acquired business or technology, or that are otherwise related to
the transaction;
0 entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or in which competitors may have
stronger market positions;
- impairing of intangible assets and goodwill acquired in transactions; and
- for foreign transactions, managing additional risks related to the integration of operations across
different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, compliance and regulatory risks associated
with specific countries.
There can be no assurance that we will manage these challenges and risks successfully. Moreover, if we are
not successful in completing transactions that we have pursued or may pursue, our business may be adversely
affected, and we may incur substantial expenses and divert significant management time and resources. In
