Revenue
Subscription revenue
Subscription revenue, which is primarily comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat offerings,
increased by 15.5%, or $242.2 million, to $1.80 billion for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $1.56 billion
for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Revenue derived from the sale of subscriptions supporting our Infrastructure-related offerings, increased by
11.8%, or $155.8 million, to $1.48 billion for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $1.32 billion for the year
ended February 28, 2015 and includes a favorable revenue adjustment of $5.3 million related to cloud-usage
revenues through our CCSP program, as described further in NOTE 2—Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining increase in subscription revenue is primarily
due to increases in volumes sold, including additional subscriptions attributable to geographic expansion and the
continued migration of customers to our open source Linux platform from proprietary operating systems.
Revenue derived from the sale of subscriptions supporting our Application Development-related and other
emerging technology offerings increased by 36.5%, or $86.4 million, to $323.0 million for the year ended
February 29, 2016 from $236.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2015. The increase is primarily due to
additional subscriptions for Red Hat JBoss Middleware offerings. We expect the growth rate of revenue derived
from our Application Development-related and other emerging technology offerings to exceed the growth rate of
revenue derived from our Infrastructure-related offerings as our Application Development-related and other
emerging technology offerings continue to gain broader market acceptance in the enterprise IT environment.
Training and services revenue
Training revenue includes fees paid by our customers for delivery of educational materials and instruction.
Services revenue includes fees received from customers for consulting services regarding our offerings,
deployment of Red Hat technologies and for delivery of added functionality to Red Hat technologies for our
major customers and OEM partners. Total training and services revenue increased by 9.0%, or $20.5 million, to
$248.8 million for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $228.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Training revenue increased by 1.9%, or $1.1 million. Our services revenue increased by 11.3%, or $19.4 million,
as a result of an increase in consulting engagements driven by increased demand for our open source solutions.
We expect services revenue to continue growing, though at a slower pace than subscription revenue as we
continue to expand our reach by enabling our channel partners to provide consulting services on our behalf.
Combined training and services revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 12.1% and 12.8% for the year
ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively.
Cost of revenue
Cost of subscription revenue
The cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to support, distribute, and package
Red Hat offerings. These costs include labor-related costs to provide technical support, security updates and
fixes, as well as costs for fulfillment. Cost of subscription revenue increased by 12.2%, or $13.8 million, to
$126.7 million for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $112.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Employee-related expenses increased $10.6 million for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to the year
ended February 28, 2015, due to the expansion of our technical staff in order to meet the demands of our growing
subscriber base for support, security updates and ﬁxes. The remaining increase relates primarily to increased
expense of $1.4 million related to facility and technology infrastructure enhancements. As the number of open
source technology subscriptions continues to increase, we expect associated support costs will continue to
increase, although we anticipate this will occur at an overall slower rate than that of subscription revenue growth
due to economies of scale. Gross profit margin on subscriptions was 93.0% and 92.8% for the year ended
February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively.
