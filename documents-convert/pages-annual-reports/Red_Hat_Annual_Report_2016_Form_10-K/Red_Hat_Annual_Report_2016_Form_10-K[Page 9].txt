OUR BUSINESS
We use the open source software development and licensing model to provide our offerings to customers
primarily on a subscription basis. Subscriptions for our offerings are marketed and sold to customers directly and
through business partners.
Development and licensing of Red Hat’s open source offerings
The open source software development model allows us to use the collective input, resources and
knowledge of a global community of contributors who collaborate to develop, maintain and enhance software.
We develop our offerings by working with open source development communities, often in a leadership role.
Red Hat sponsors a number of open source communities, including the CentOS project, the Ceph community
project, the Fedora Project, FeedHenry, GlusterFS, the Boss community projects and OpenShift Origin. We are
also an active contributor in other communities such as Apache Camel, Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
Linux Kernel, Open Container Initiative, Open Platform for NFV, OpenStack and Project Kubernetes. Our role
helps us to benefit from the efforts of these communities, which we believe enhances acceptance and support of
our offerings and technologies. Additionally, the open and transparent nature of these communities provides our
customers and potential customers, who may also be part of these open source communities, with access and
insights into, and the ability to inﬂuence, the future direction of our offerings.
Under the open source licensing model, a software developer distributes the software under an open source
license, such as the GNU General Public License (“GPL”), GNU Lesser General Public License or Apache
License. Open source licenses provide relatively broad rights for recipients of the software to use, copy, modify
and redistribute the software. These rights afford significant latitude for recipients to inspect, suggest changes to,
customize or enhance the software.
The open source model provides an inherent level of transparency and choice that contrasts with the
proprietary software model. Under the proprietary software model, a software vendor generally develops the
software itself or acquires components from other vendors, without the input from a wider community of
participants. The vendor generally licenses to the user only the machine-readable binary (or object) code version
of the software, with no or limited rights to copy, modify or redistribute the software, and does not make the
underlying source code available to the user or other developers. Moreover, peer review and collaborative
enhancements are more difficult because of the lack of access to the source code.
The scale and efficiency of open source software development has greatly increased through the availability
of collaborative technologies and cloud-based tools, such as email lists, websites and code repositories. These
technologies have enabled a global community of developers to collaborate on more complex open source
projects, many of which are commercially funded.
