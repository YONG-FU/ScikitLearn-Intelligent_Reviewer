Convertible note offering
On October 7, 2014, we completed our offering of $805.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.25%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “convertible notes”). The convertible notes were sold in a private
placement under a purchase agreement, dated as of October 1, 2014, for resale to qualiﬁed institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
We used $148.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the convertible notes to pay the cost of the
privately-negotiated convertible note hedge transactions described in NOTE 22—Convertible Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements. Proceeds of $79.8 million were received by us from the sale of warrants
pursuant to the warrant transactions also described in NOTE 22—Convertible Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In addition, we used $375.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering of the convertible notes to
repurchase shares of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase program pursuant to an agreement
that we entered into on October 1, 2014, as described in NOTE 17—Share Repurchase Programs to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, potential acquisitions or strategic transactions.
