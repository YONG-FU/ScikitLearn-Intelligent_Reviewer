Revenue from our non-U.S. operations has been translated into U.S. dollars using the average foreign
currency exchange rates for each month of the twelve months ended February 29, 2016. In an effort to
provide a comparable framework for assessing how our business performed when compared to the fiscal
year ended February 28, 2015 in light of the effect of exchange rate differences, we believe it is helpful to
exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations by translating revenue from our non-U.S.
operations for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 using the average foreign currency exchanges rates
for the twelve months ended February 28, 2015.
Subscription revenue
Our enterprise technologies are delivered primarily under subscription agreements. These agreements
typically have a one- or three-year subscription period. A subscription generally entitles a customer to, among
other things, a specified level of support, as well as security updates, fixes, functionality enhancements, upgrades
to the technologies, each if and when available, and compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and
software. Subscription revenue increased sequentially for each quarter of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014
and was driven primarily by the increased use of our offerings by customers and our expansion of sales channels
and geographic footprint during these periods.
