RED HAT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1—Company
Red Hat, Inc., incorporated in Delaware, together with its subsidiaries (“Red Hat” or the “Company”) is a
leading global provider of open source software solutions, using a community-powered approach to develop and
offer reliable and high-performing operating system, virtualization, management, middleware, cloud, mobile and
storage technologies.
Open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the
development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software.
Because open source software code is often freely shared, there are customarily no licensing fees for the use of
open source software. Therefore, the Company does not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself.
The Company provides value to its customers through the development, aggregation, integration, testing,
certification, delivery, maintenance, enhancement and support of its Red Hat technologies, and by providing a
level of performance, scalability, ﬂexibility, reliability, and security for the technologies the Company packages
and distributes. Moreover, because communities of developers not employed by the Company assist with the
creation of the Company’s open source offerings, opportunities for further innovation of the Company’s
offerings are supplemented by these communities.
The Company derives its revenue and generates cash from customers primarily from two sources:
(i) subscription revenue and (ii) training and services revenue. These arrangements typically involve
subscriptions to Red Hat technologies. The arrangements with the Company’s customers that produce this
revenue and cash are explained in further detail in NOTE 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
