Our “Patent Promise” on software patents limits our ability to enforce our patent rights in certain
circumstances.
As part of our commitment to the open source community, we provide our Patent Promise on software
patents. Under our Patent Promise, we agree, subject to certain limitations, to not enforce our patent rights
against users of open source software covered by certain open source licenses, including the GNU General Public
License version 2.0 and version 3.0, GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 and version 3.0, IBM
Public License version 1.0, Common Public License version 1.0, Q Public License version 1.0, Open Software
License version 3.0 and any other open source license granted by Red Hat. While we may be able to claim
protection of our intellectual property under other rights, such as trade secrets or contractual rights, our Patent
Promise effectively limits our ability to assert our patent rights against these third parties (even if we were to
conclude that their use infringes our patents with competing offerings), unless any such third party asserts its
patent rights against us. This limitation on our ability to assert our patent rights against others could harm our
business and ability to compete.
We are, and may become, involved in disputes and lawsuits that could adversely affect our business.
Lawsuits or legal proceedings may be commenced against us. These disputes and proceedings may involve
significant expense and divert the attention of management and other employees. If we do not prevail in these
matters, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for
additional information.
If we fail to comply with laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection, our business could
be adversely affected.
Our business is subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations that apply to the
collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data. These data privacy- and
protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and
implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. For
example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.—EU Safe Harbor Framework. The
Safe Harbor Framework had established a lawful method for the transfer of personal data from the European
Economic Area (“EEA”) to the U.S. The decision of the European Court of Justice has resulted in increased
uncertainty and greater complexity and risk relating to transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.
Any failure by us to comply with data privacy- and protection-related laws and regulations could result in
enforcement actions, significant penalties or other legal actions against us or our customers or suppliers. An
actual or alleged failure to comply, which could result in negative publicity, reduce demand for our offerings,
increase the cost of compliance, require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue, restrict our
ability to provide our offerings in certain locations, result in our customers’ inability to use our offerings and
prohibit data transfers or result in other claims, liabilities or sanctions, including fines, could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash ﬂows.
If we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our business
could be adversely affected.
Our contracts with our customers may include specialized performance requirements. In particular, our
contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various government
certification requirements, procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their
formation, administration and performance. Any failure by us or our channel partners to comply with the specific
provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations by us or our channel
partners could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of
contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, ﬁnes and
