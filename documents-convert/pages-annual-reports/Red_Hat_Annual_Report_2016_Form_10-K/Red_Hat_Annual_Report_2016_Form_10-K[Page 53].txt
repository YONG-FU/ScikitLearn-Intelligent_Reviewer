Our annual billings proxy increased by 11.6%, or $240.5 million, to $2.31 billion for the year ended
February 29, 2016 from $2.07 billion for the year ended February 28, 2015. Using the average foreign currency
exchange rates from our prior year ended February 28, 2015, our billings proxy for the year ended February 29,
2016 would have increased by approximately 17.4%, or $361.3 million.
Seasonalily
Our fourth fiscal quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new billings and renewals. This
pattern has become more pronounced over time as the number of customers with renewal dates occurring in the
last half of our fiscal year has continued to increase. Furthermore, our quarterly sales cycles are frequently
weighted toward the end of the quarter, with an increased volume of sales completed in the last weeks of each
quarter. The year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business
and renewal activity causes the value of invoices making up our billings that we generate in the last half of our
fiscal year to continually increase in proportion to the value of our invoices making up our billings in the first
half of our fiscal year. Below is a summary of our billings (approximated as described above by adding revenue
for the period with the change in deferred revenue as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for
the same period) by quarter for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 (in thousands):

Backlog
Our total backlog as of February 29, 2016 was approximately $2.13 billion and includes amounts billed to
customers and recognized as current and long-term deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet of $1.27
billion and $449.6 million, respectively, plus the value of non-cancellable subscription and services agreements
to be billed in the future and not reﬂected in our financial statements, which was in excess of $410.0 million. Our
total backlog as of February 28, 2015 was approximately $1.86 billion. The value of non-cancellable subscription
and service agreements to be billed in the future and not reﬂected in our financial statements as of February 28,
2015 was in excess of $380.0 million. The increase in total backlog from approximately $1.86 billion as of
February 28, 2015 to approximately $2.13 billion as of February 29, 2016 demonstrates increased customer
commitment to our open source technologies.
We report our off-balance sheet backlog as a conservative approximation, often describing the amount as
“in excess of”, primarily because the value of underlying contracts is derived from data not yet subjected to the
complete application of our revenue recognition policies. We endeavor to derive the value of our off-balance
sheet backlog in a consistent manner year over year and therefore believe the amounts are comparable.
Revenue by geography
In the year ended February 29, 2016, approximately 40.9%, or $838.7 million, of our revenue was generated
outside the US. compared to approximately 42.8%, or $766.7 million, for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, our revenue generated outside the US.
would have been 44.2%, or $959.5 million, of our total revenue. Our international operations are expected to
