RED HAT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default
occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding
convertible notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, all the
convertible notes to be due and payable.
In accounting for the issuance of the convertible notes, the Company separated the convertible notes into
liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the
estimated fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying
amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value
of the liability component from the face value of the convertible notes as a whole. The excess of the face value of
the convertible notes as a whole over the carrying amount of the liability component (the “debt discount”) is
amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes using the effective interest method with an
effective interest rate of 2.86% per annum. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to
meet the conditions for equity classification.
As of February 29, 2016, the Notes consisted of the following (in thousands):

In accounting for the transaction costs related to the convertible note issuance, the Company allocated the
total amount incurred of $15.2 million to the liability and equity components based on their relative fair values.
Issuance costs attributable to the liability component totaled $13.4 million and are being amortized to interest
expense over the term of the convertible notes using the effective interest method. The remaining $1.8 million of
issuance costs have been allocated to the equity component and are included in Additional paid-in capital on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 29, 2016. Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred
tax asset of $0.7 million related to the $1.8 million equity component of transactional costs which are deductible
for tax purposes.
