facilities.
We have utilized, and will continue from time to time to utilize, cash and investments to fund, among other
potential uses, purchases of our common stock, purchases of fixed assets, purchases of intangible assets
(primarily patents), and mergers and acquisitions. Given our historically strong operating cash ﬂow and the $2.0
billion of cash and investments held at February 29, 2016, we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances,
together with our ability to generate additional cash from operations, should be sufficient to satisfy our cash
requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of
favorable capital market conditions that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital.
We believe that our ability to generate additional cash from operations will continue; however, there can be
no assurances that we will be able to generate cash from operations at a level equal to the current rate or that such
cash ﬂows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make or that cash
may be located in or generated in the appropriate geographic region where we can effectively use such cash. We
may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans, which may require us to raise
additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means. There can be no
assurances that any such ﬁnancing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us, if at all.
As of February 29, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities totaled $2.0
billion, of which $838.3 million was held outside the U.S. Our intent is to reinvest the earnings of foreign
subsidiaries indefinitely outside the U.S. to fund both organic growth and acquisitions. From time to time,
however, we may remit a portion of these earnings to the extent it is economically prudent. For further discussion
related to geographic segments, see NOTE 20—Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
With 58.0% of our available cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments, as of February 29,
2016, held within the U.S., we do not anticipate a need to repatriate any foreign earnings for the foreseeable
future. However, if cash held outside the U.S. were needed to fund our U.S. operations, under current tax law we
would be subject to additional taxes on the portion related to repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As
of February 29, 2016, cumulative undistributed foreign earnings totaled $537.7 million. For further discussion,
see NOTE 11—Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
As of February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements and
do not utilize any “structured debt”, “special purpose” or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing
purposes.
