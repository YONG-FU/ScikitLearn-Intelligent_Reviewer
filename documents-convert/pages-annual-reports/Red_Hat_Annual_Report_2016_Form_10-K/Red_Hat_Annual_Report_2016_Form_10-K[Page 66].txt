Subscription revenue
Subscription revenue increased by 16.8%, or $224.5 million, to $1.56 billion for the year ended
February 28, 2015 from $1.34 billion for the year ended February 28, 2014.
Revenue derived from the sale of subscriptions supporting our Infrastructure-related offerings, increased by
13.1%, or $153.6 million, to $1.32 billion for the year ended February 28, 2015 from $1.17 billion for the year
ended February 28, 2014 and is primarily due to increases in volumes sold, including additional subscriptions
attributable to geographic expansion and the continued migration of customers to our open source Linux platform
from proprietary platforms.
Revenue derived from the sale of subscriptions supporting our Application Development-related and other
emerging technology offerings increased by 42.8%, or $70.9 million, to $236.5 million for the year ended
February 28, 2015 from $165.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2014. The increase is primarily due to
additional subscriptions for Red Hat JBoss Middleware offerings. We expect the growth rate of revenue derived
from our Application Development-related and other emerging technology offerings to exceed the growth rate of
revenue derived from our Infrastructure-related offerings as our Application Development-related and other
emerging technology offerings continue to gain broader market acceptance in the enterprise IT environment.
Training and services revenue
Total training and services revenue increased by 15.4%, or $30.4 million, to $228.3 million for the year
ended February 28, 2015 from $197.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2014. Training revenue increased
7.9%, or $4.2 million. Our services revenue increased by 18.1%, or $26.2 million, as a result of an increase in
consulting engagements driven by increased demand for our open source solutions. We expect services revenue
to continue growing, though at a slower pace than subscription revenue as we continue to expand our reach by
enabling our channel partners to provide consulting services on our behalf. Combined training and services
revenue as a percentage of total revenue was 12.8% and 12.9% for the year ended February 28, 2015 and
February 28, 2014, respectively.
Cost of revenue
Cost of subscription revenue
Cost of subscription revenue increased by 16.2%, or $15.8 million, to $112.9 million for the year ended
February 28, 2015 from $97.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2014. Employee-related expenses
increased $11.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2015 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2014,
due to the expansion of our technical staff in order to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base for
support, security updates and fixes. The remaining increase relates to increased expense of $1.7 million related to
facility and technology infrastructure enhancements. As the number of open source technology subscriptions
continues to increase, we expect associated support cost will continue to increase, although we anticipate this will
occur at an overall slower rate than that of subscription revenue growth due to economies of scale. Gross profit
margin on subscriptions was 92.8% and 92.7% for the year ended February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014,
respectively.
Cost of training and services revenue
Cost of training and services revenue increased by 18.3%, or $24.8 million, to $160.3 million for the year
ended February 28, 2015 from $135.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2014. Costs to deliver our services
revenue increased by 21.4%, or $23.0 million, to $130.2 million for the year ended February 28, 2015. The
increase in costs to deliver services includes $11.9 million and $9.2 million of increased employee compensation
expenses and outside contractor fees, respectively. The increase in both employee compensation expense and
contractor fees is due to the expansion of our professional consulting teams needed to provide services related to
our emerging technology offerings. As a result of such investment in staffing, profit margin from professional
