Product indemnification
The Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the
other party from losses arising in connection with the Company’s services or products, or from losses arising in
connection with certain events defined within a particular contract, which may include litigation or claims
relating to intellectual property infringement, certain losses arising from damage to property or injury to persons
or other matters. In each of these circumstances, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party
making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow
the Company to challenge the other party’s claims. Further, the Company’s obligations under these agreements
may in certain cases be limited in terms of time and/or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have
recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by the Company.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar
agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the facts and circumstances involved
in each particular agreement. The Company does not record a liability for claims related to indemnification
unless the Company concludes that the likelihood of a material claim is probable and estimable. Payments
pursuant to these indemnification claims during the years ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015 and
February 28, 2014 were in the aggregate immaterial.
NOTE 15—Legal Proceedings
The Company experiences routine litigation in the normal course of its business, including patent litigation.
The Company presently believes that the outcome of this routine litigation will not have a material adverse effect
on its financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
