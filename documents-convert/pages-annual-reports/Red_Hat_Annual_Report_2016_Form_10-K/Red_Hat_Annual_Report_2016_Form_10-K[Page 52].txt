Subscription revenue increased 15.5%, or $242.2 million, for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016
compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
ﬂuctuations, subscription revenue increased by 22.1% for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016. The increase
in subscription revenue is driven primarily by additional subscriptions related to our principal Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and Red Hat JBoss Middleware offerings, which continue to gain broader market acceptance in mission-
critical areas of computing, and our expansion of sales channels and our geographic footprint. The increase is, in
part, a result of the continued migration of enterprises in industries such as financial services, government,
technology and telecommunications to our open source solutions from proprietary technologies.
Training and services revenue
Training and services revenue increased 9.0%, or $20.5 million, for the year ended February 29, 2016 as
compared to the year ended February 28, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, training
and services revenue increased by 17.1%. The increase is driven primarily by customer interest in new products
and increased demand for our open source solutions.
Deferred revenue, billings proxy, seasonality and backlog
Deferred revenue
Our deferred revenue, current and long-term, balance at February 29, 2016 was $1.72 billion. Total deferred
revenue at February 29, 2016 increased 16.2%, or $240.2 million, as compared to the balance of $1.48 billion at
February 28, 2015. Because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies, deferred revenue
improves predictability of future revenue. For example, current deferred revenue provides a baseline for revenue
to be recognized over the next twelve months. Similarly, long-term deferred revenue provides a baseline for
revenue to be recognized beyond twelve months. Revenue derived from CCSPs for the delivery of our
technologies as a service available on demand is recognized by us in the period earned and billed in arrears. As a
result, revenue derived from CCSPs has no associated deferred revenue.
The increase in deferred revenue reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets of $240.2 million differs
from the increase of $260.5 million we reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal year
ended February 29, 2016 as the amount reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal
year ended February 29, 2016 excludes (i) the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to
translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency into US. dollars and
(ii) deferred revenue of approximately $0.4 million acquired as part of business combinations during the same
period.
Current deferred revenue increased by 16.2%, or $177.8 million, to $1.27 billion at February 29, 2016 from
$1.10 billion at February 28, 2015 and long-term deferred revenue increased by 16.1%, or $62.4 million, to
$449.6 million at February 29, 2016 from $387.2 million at February 28, 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations, current deferred revenue increased by 17.4%, or $190.9 million, and long-
term deferred revenue increased by 18.0%, or $69.6 million, from February 28, 2015 to February 29, 2016.
Billings proxy
We approximate our annual billings by adding revenue recognized on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations to the change in total deferred revenue reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We
use the change in deferred revenue as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows because the
amount has been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred
revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries’ functional currencies into US. dollars.
