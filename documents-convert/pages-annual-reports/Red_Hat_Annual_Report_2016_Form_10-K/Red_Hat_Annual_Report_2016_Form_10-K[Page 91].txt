RED HAT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
debt issuance costs as a deferred charge on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 for the fiscal
year ended February 29, 2016 and has applied the update retrospectively to its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
February 28, 2015.
Accounting pronouncements being evaluated
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”). The
FASB issued ASU 2016-09 to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences. This guidance is effective for the Company as of the first quarter of the
fiscal year ending February 28, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the overall impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on its consolidated
financial statements. However, a significant impact will result from changes in how the Company recognized the
excess tax benefits (“windfalls”) or deficiencies (“shortfalls”) related to share-based payments. For example,
such windfalls and shortfalls are currently credited or charged, respectively, to additional paid in capital in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under ASU 2016-09, these windfalls and shortfalls will be recognized
as a tax benefit or expense, respectively, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years
ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014, the Company recognized net windfalls
totaling $19.8 million, $6.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as additional paid in capital. Under the
updated guidance these amounts would have instead been recognized as a reduction in tax expense and
consequently an increase in net income.
In addition to the income tax consequences described above, the excess tax benefits from share-based
payment arrangements that the Company currently reports as cash ﬂows from financing activities on its
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows—which totaled $20.2 million, $5.6 million and $12.8 million for the
years ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014, respectively—will instead, under
ASU 2016-09, be reported as cash ﬂows from operating activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU
2016-02”). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations.
Under ASU 2016-02, lessees will recognize a right-of—use asset and a lease liability for virtually all of their
leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present
value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct
costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either
operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases)
while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). This guidance
is effective for the Company as of the first quarter of its fiscal year ending February 28, 2019. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact that this updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-
01”). The FASB issued ASU 2016-01 to require equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Equity investments that do not have
readily determinable fair values are allowed to be remeasured upon the occurrence of an observable price change
or upon identification of an impairment. This guidance is effective for the Company as of the first quarter of the
fiscal year ending February 28, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this updated standard
will have on its consolidated financial statements.
