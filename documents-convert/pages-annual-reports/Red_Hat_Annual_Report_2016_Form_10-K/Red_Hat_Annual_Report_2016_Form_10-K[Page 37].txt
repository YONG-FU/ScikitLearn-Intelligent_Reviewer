° laws and policies of the US. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes;
0 difficulty selecting and monitoring channel partners;
- differing technology standards and customer requirements;
° lower levels of availability or use of the Internet, through which our software is often delivered;
- difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights globally due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual
property rights;
- difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language,
legal, cultural and other differences;
- different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
- difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with the our brands;
° export and import laws and regulations that could prevent us from delivering our offerings into and from
certain countries;
° public health risks and natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations;
- limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
° changes in import/export duties, quotas or other trade barriers that could affect the competitive pricing
of our offerings and reduce our market share in some countries; and
- economic or political instability or terrorist acts in some international markets that could adversely
affect our business in those markets or result in the loss or forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss
of sums spent developing and marketing those assets and the revenue associated with them.
Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our
operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform.
During our fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, a substantial portion of our subscription revenue was
derived from our Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings. Although we are continuing to develop other offerings, we
expect that revenue from Red Hat Enterprise Linux will constitute a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable
future. Declines and variability in demand for Red Hat Enterprise Linux could occur as a result of:
° competitive products and pricing;
- failure to release new or enhanced versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a timely basis, or at all;
° technological change that we are unable to address with Red Hat Enterprise Linux; or
- future economic conditions.
Additionally, as more customers and potential customers virtualize their data centers and move computing
projects to cloud environments, demand for operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux may decline.
Moreover, as data centers become more virtualized and move to cloud environments, we may experience a
decline in growth if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business model and offerings accordingly. Due to the
concentration of our revenue from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, our business, financial condition, operating results
and cash flows could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
