RED HAT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The excess of purchase price paid for Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank and other acquisitions over
the fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill. Goodwill comprises the majority of the
purchase price paid for each of the acquired businesses because these businesses were focused on emerging
technologies such as development and operations automation, mobile technologies, cloud-enabling technologies
and software-defined storage technologies, which consequently—at the time of acquisition—generated relatively
little revenue. However, these acquired businesses, with their assembled, highly-specialized workforces and
community of contributors, are expected to both expand the Company’s existing technology portfolio and
advance the Company’s market position overall in open source solutions.
