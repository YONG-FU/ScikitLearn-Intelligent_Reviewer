Obligations under contracts that we may cancel without signiÔ¨Åcant penalty are not included in the table
above. In addition, because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future
payments related to uncertain tax positions, such liabilities are not included in the above table. However, as of
February 29, 2016, we have recognized a total of $73.4 million related to such liabilities, which are included in
Other long-term obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
