Interest expense
Interest expense increased by $9.2 million for the year ended February 28, 2015 as compared to the year
ended February 28, 2014. The increase in interest expense for the year ended February 28, 2015 is attributable to
the issuance of convertible notes which are described in NOTE 22—Convertible Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net increased $5.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2015 as compared to the
year ended February 28, 2014. The increase is primarily due to gains on the sale of certain equity investments of
$8.9 million, partially offset by impairment losses on other equity investments of $4.6 million, during the year
ended February 28, 2015.
Income taxes
During the year ended February 28, 2015, we recorded $75.3 million of income tax expense, which resulted
in an effective tax rate of 29.5%. Our effective tax rate of 29.5% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of
35 .0% primarily due to the foreign tax credit, foreign income taxed at lower rates, research tax credits and the
domestic production activities deduction. The foreign tax credit and foreign tax rate differentials were partially
offset by a deemed foreign dividend. The provision for income tax for the year ended February 28, 2015 consists
of $57.2 million of U.S. income tax expense and $18.1 million of foreign income tax expense.
During the year ended February 28, 2014, we recorded $61.3 million of income tax expense, which resulted
in an annual effective tax rate of 25 .6%. Our effective tax rate of 25.6% differs from the U.S. federal statutory
rate of 35.0% primarily due to the foreign tax credit, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the domestic
production activities deduction and research tax credits. The provision for income tax for the year ended
February 28, 2014 consisted of $39.0 million of U.S. income tax expense and $22.3 million of foreign income tax
expense.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We derive our liquidity and operating capital primarily from cash ﬂows from operations. Historically, we
also received cash from the sale of equity securities, including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of
common stock in our initial and follow-on public offerings, and the issuance of convertible notes, including our
recent issuance of convertible notes with par value totaling $805.0 million described previously in Overview:
Convertible note offering and in detail in NOTE 22—Convertible Notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements. At February 29, 2016, we had total cash and investments of $2.0 billion, which was comprised of
$927.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $281.1 million of short-term, available-for—sale fixed-income
investments and $786.5 million of long-term, available-for—sale fixed-income investments. This compares to total
cash and investments of $1.81 billion at February 28, 2015.
With $927.8 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand, we believe our cash and cash equivalent
balances, together with our ability to generate additional cash from operations, should be sufficient to satisfy our
cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of
favorable capital market conditions that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital. We presently do
not intend to liquidate our short— and long-term investments in debt securities prior to their scheduled maturity
dates. However, in the event that we liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there are
adverse changes in market interest rates or the overall economic environment, we could be required to recognize
a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate those investments. At February 29, 2016 and February 28,
2015, accumulated unrealized gains and losses on our available-for—sale debt securities totaled a $1.4 million loss
and a $0.2 million gain, respectively.
