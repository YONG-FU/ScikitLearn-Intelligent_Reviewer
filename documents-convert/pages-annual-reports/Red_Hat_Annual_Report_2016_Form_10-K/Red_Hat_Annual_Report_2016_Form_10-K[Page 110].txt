million to the ASR Agreement counterparty and received 5,312,555 shares of its common stock from the ASR
Agreement counterparty, which represented 80 percent of the shares deliverable to the Company under the ASR

with $300.0 million, or 80 percent, of the $375.0 million upfront payment being recorded in Treasury stock in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at February 28, 2015 and (ii) the unsettled portion of the ASR
Agreement of $75.0 million was recorded in Additional paid-in capital on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of February 28, 2015. The $75.0 million representing the unsettled portion of the ASR originally
recorded in Additional paid-in capital was reclassified upon settlement to Treasury stock during the fiscal year
ended February 29, 2016.
