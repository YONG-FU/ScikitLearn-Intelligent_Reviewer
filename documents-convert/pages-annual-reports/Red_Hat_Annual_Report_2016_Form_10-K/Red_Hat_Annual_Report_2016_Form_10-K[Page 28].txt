complex, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain these beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. If we
are unable to maintain our corporate culture, we may find it difficult to attract and retain motivated employees,
continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy. As a result, our business, financial
condition, operating results and cash ﬂows could be adversely affected.
Our emerging technology offerings are based on developing technologies and business models, and the
potential market for these offerings remains uncertain.
Our emerging technology offerings, which include our cloud, mobile and storage offerings, are based on
developing technologies and business models, the success of which will depend on the technological and
operational benefits and cost savings associated with the adoption of these technologies. These technologies are
rapidly evolving, and their development is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation
and investment as well as the accurate anticipation of technology trends, market demand and customer needs. We
expect competition to remain intense and, as with many emerging IT sectors, these technologies may be subject
to a “first mover” effect pursuant to which certain product offerings rapidly capture a significant portion of
market share and developer attention. Moreover, we may make errors in reacting to relevant business trends and
predicting which technologies are successful or otherwise develop into industry standards.
Adoption of emerging technologies may occur more slowly or less pervasively than we expect and the
revenue growth associated with these offerings may be slower than currently expected. Moreover, even if
emerging technologies are adopted widely by enterprises, our offerings in these areas may not attract a sufficient
number of users or generate attractive financial results. We incur expenses associated with these offerings in
advance of our ability to generate associated revenue. Demand for our emerging technology offerings may
unfavorably impact demand for our other offerings, including software subscriptions and related professional
services. If the market for our emerging technologies offerings fails to develop adequately, it could have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash ﬂows.
Our business model may encounter customer resistance or we may experience a decline in the demand for
our offerings.
We provide Red Hat enterprise technologies primarily under annual or multi-year subscriptions. A
subscription generally entitles a customer to, among other things, a specified level of support, as well as security
updates, fixes, functionality enhancements, upgrades to the technologies, each, if and when available, and
compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and software. While we believe this practice complies with
the requirements of the GNU General Public License, and while we have reviewed this practice with the Free
Software Foundation, the organization that maintains and provides interpretations of the GNU General Public
License, customers may fail to honor the terms of our subscription agreements.
Demand for our offerings depends substantially on the general demand for enterprise software, which
ﬂuctuates based on numerous factors, including the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective
customers, and general economic conditions. In addition, our customers generally undertake a significant
evaluation process that may result in a lengthy sales cycle. We spend substantial time, effort, and money on our
sales efforts, including developing and implementing appropriate go-to-market strategies and training our sales
force and channel partners in order to effectively market new offerings, without any assurance that our efforts
will produce any sales. The purchase of our offerings may be discretionary and can involve significant
expenditures. If our current and prospective customers cut costs, then they may significantly reduce their
enterprise software expenditures.
As technologies and the markets for our enterprise offerings change, our annual or multi-year subscription-
based business model may no longer meet the needs of our customers. For example, a business model based on
annual or multi-year subscriptions may no longer be competitive in an environment where disruptive
technologies (such as cloud computing) enable customers to consume computing resources on an hourly basis or
