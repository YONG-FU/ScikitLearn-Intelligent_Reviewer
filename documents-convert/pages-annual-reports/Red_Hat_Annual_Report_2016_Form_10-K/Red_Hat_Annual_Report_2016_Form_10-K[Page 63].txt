Cost of training and services revenue
Cost of training and services revenue is mainly comprised of personnel and third-party consulting costs for
the design, development and delivery of custom engineering, training courses and professional services provided
to various types of customers. Cost of training and services revenue increased by 14.1%, or $22.6 million, to
$183.0 million for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $160.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Costs to deliver our services revenue increased by 16.0%, or $20.9 million, to $151.1 million for the year ended
February 29, 2016. The increase in costs to deliver services includes $14.5 million and $2.1 million of increased
employee compensation expenses and outside contractor fees, respectively. The increase in both employee
compensation expense and contractor fees is due to the expansion of our professional consulting teams needed to
meet a surge in demand for services related to our emerging technology offerings. As a result of such investment
in staffing, profit margin from professional services decreased to 20.8% for the year ended February 29, 2016
from 24.0% for the year ended February 28, 2015. Total costs to deliver training and services as a percentage of
training and services revenue increased to 73.5% for the year ended February 29, 2016 from 70.2% for the year
ended February 28, 2015.
Gross profit
Excluding the favorable revenue adjustment of $5.3 million described previously, gross profit margin
increased to 84.9% for the year ended February 29, 2016 from 84.7% for the year ended February 28, 2015. The
increase was due to a favorable mix shift as subscription revenue increased relative to services and was partially
offset by increased costs to deliver our consulting services as a result of investments in personnel, infrastructure
and processes to support our emerging technologies.
Operating expenses
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing
personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows. Sales and
marketing expense increased by 16.6%, or $120.6 million, to $849.0 million for the year ended February 29,
2016 from $728.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2015. Selling costs increased by 13.8%, or $77.1
million, for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2015 and include
$59.9 million and $5.3 million of additional employee- and travel-related expenses, respectively, the majority of
which is attributable to the expansion of our sales force from the prior year. Marketing costs grew by 25.5%, or
$43.4 million, for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2015. The
increase in marketing costs includes $15.9 million of employee compensation expense related to increased
headcount and incremental marketing program costs of $25.5 million. The remaining increase in sales and
marketing costs primarily relates to facility and technology infrastructure enhancements, which increased $4.6
million for the year ended February 29, 2016 as compared to the year ended February 28, 2015. As a result of
continued investments made to expand the breadth of our global sales coverage and depth of our product sales
coverage, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 41.4% for the year ended
February 29, 2016 from 40.7% for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Research and development
Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for development of
software technologies. Research and development expense increased by 12.4%, or $45.5 million, to $413.3
million for the year ended February 29, 2016 from $367.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2015.
Employee compensation increased by $39.8 million primarily from the expansion of our engineering group
through both direct hires and business acquisitions as we continue investing in cloud management and our other
emerging technologies. The remaining increase in research and development costs relates primarily to process
and technology infrastructure enhancements, which increased $1.6 million. Research and development expense
was 20.1% and 20.6% of total revenue for the year ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively.
