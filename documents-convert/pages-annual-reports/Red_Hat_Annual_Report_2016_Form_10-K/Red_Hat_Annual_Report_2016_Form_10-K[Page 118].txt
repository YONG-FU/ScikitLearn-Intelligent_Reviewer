RED HAT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
The fair value of the convertible notes, which was determined based on inputs that are observable in the
market (Level 2), and the carrying value of convertible notes (the carrying value excludes the equity component
of the convertible notes classified in equity) is as follows (in thousands):
7 As of February 29, 2016 7
Fair Value Carrying Value
Convertiblenotes $714,950 $723,942
Convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions
On October 1, 2014, the Company entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions
with certain of the Initial Purchasers of the convertible notes or their respective affiliates (the “Option
Counterparties”).
The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution with respect to shares of
the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the convertible notes and/or offset any cash payments the
Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted notes, as the case may be. To
partially offset the $148.0 million cost of the convertible note hedge transactions, the Company issued warrants and
received proceeds of $79.8 million. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock underlying the warrants
total 10,965,630, the same number of shares underlying the convertible notes and the convertible note hedge
transactions. The combination of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions effectively
increases the initial conversion price of the convertible notes from $73.41 per share to $101.65 per share. As a
result, the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect with respect to the Company’s common stock to the extent
that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the warrant
transactions, exceeds the $101.65 strike price of the warrants. However, subject to certain conditions, the Company
may elect to settle all of the warrants in cash. The $101.65 strike price of the warrants represents a premium of
approximately 80% over the $56.47 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on October 1, 2014.
The purchase of convertible note hedges and proceeds from issuance of warrants were recorded in
stockholders’ equity and will continue to be classified as stockholders’ equity.
