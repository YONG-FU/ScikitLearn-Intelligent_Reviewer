REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a—15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act). Internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the framework in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over
financial reportng was effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
