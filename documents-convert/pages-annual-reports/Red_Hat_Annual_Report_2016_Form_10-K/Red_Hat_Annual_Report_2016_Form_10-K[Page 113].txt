NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
NOTE 19—Earnings Per Share
The Company computes basic net income per common share by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive
potential common share equivalents then outstanding. Potential common share equivalents consist of shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of share-based awards.
The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators of the earnings per share (“EPS”)
calculation for the years ended February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014 (in thousands,
except per share amounts):

With respect to the Company’s convertible notes, the Company has the option to pay cash or deliver, as the
case may be, either cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock for
the aggregate amount due upon conversion of the convertible notes. The Company’s intent is to settle the
principal amount of the convertible notes in cash upon conversion. As a result, upon conversion of the
convertible notes, only the amounts payable in excess of the principal amounts of the convertible notes are
considered in diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method. See NOTE 22—Convertible Notes to
the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the convertible notes.
Warrants to purchase 10,965,630 shares of the Company’s common stock at $101.65 per share were
outstanding during the ﬁscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the warrants’ exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
Company’s common stock during the related period.
The following share awards are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
aggregate value of proceeds considered received upon either exercise or vesting was greater than the average
market price of the Company’s common stock during the related periods and the effect of including such share
awards in the computation would be anti-dilutive (in thousands):
