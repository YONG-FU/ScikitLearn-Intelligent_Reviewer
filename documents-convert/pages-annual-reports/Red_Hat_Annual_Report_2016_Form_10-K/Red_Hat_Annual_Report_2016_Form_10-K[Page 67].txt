Gross profit
Gross profit margin decreased slightly to 84.7% for the year ended February 28, 2015 from 84.8% for the

offerings, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform and OpenShift by Red Hat.

The increase in marketing costs includes $14.1 million of employee compensation expense related to increased
headcount and incremental advertising costs of $7.8 million to support our marketing efforts. The remaining
increase in sales and marketing costs primarily relates to facility and technology infrastructure enhancements,
which increased $4.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2015 as compared to the year ended February 28,
2014. As a result of continued investments made to expand the breadth of our global sales coverage and depth of
our product sales coverage, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 40.7% for the

costs, including legal and accounting fees, relating to business acquisitions of $4.0 million, partially offset by a
decrease in other outside service expenses of $1.8 million. General and administrative expense decreased as a
percentage of revenue to 9.5% for the year ended February 28, 2015 from 9.9% for the year ended February 28,
