Regional year-over-year variations in gross profit margins are primarily due to slight product mix shifts
between subscriptions and services.
As we continue to expand our sales and support services within our geographic regions, we expect gross
profit margins across geographic regions to further converge over the long run due to the similarity of products
and services offered, similarity in production and distribution methods and the similarity in customer types or
classes. These geographic profit margins exclude the impact of share-based compensation expense, which was
not allocated to our geographic regions.
Income from operations
Operating income was 14.0%, 14.0% and 15.1% of total revenue for each of the years ended February 29,
2016, February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014, respectively. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue
increased slightly to 70.9% for the year ended February 29, 2016 from 70.8% for the year ended February 28,
2015 and 69.7% for the year ended February 28, 2014 due to continued investment in new and emerging cloud
management technologies, including our recent business combinations. These investments are described further
in our analysis of results of operations below.
Income from operations by geography
Operating income as a percentage of revenue generated by our geographic regions for the years ended
February 29, 2016, February 28, 2015 and February 28, 2014 was as follows:

Cash, cash equivalents, investments in debt securities and cash ﬂow from operations
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investments in debt securities
balances at February 29, 2016 totaled $2.0 billion. Cash generated from operating activities for the year ended
February 29, 2016 totaled $716.1 million, which represents an increase of 15.0% in operating cash ﬂow as
compared to the year ended February 28, 2015. This increase is due to an increase in subscription and services
revenues, billings and collections during the same period.
Our significant cash and investment balances give us a measure of ﬂexibility to take advantage of
opportunities such as acquisitions, increasing investment in our international operations and repurchasing our
common stock.
Foreign currency exchange rates’ impact on results of operations
Approximately 40.9% of our revenue for the year ended February 29, 2016 came from sales outside the U.S.
We are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency ﬂuctuation primarily from receivables denominated in
foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component of net
income. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average
exchange rates for each applicable month in a period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign
currencies, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated transactions results in increased revenue and
