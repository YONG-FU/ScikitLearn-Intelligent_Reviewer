Any such penalties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash
ï¬‚ows. In addition, the political and media scrutiny surrounding any governmental investigation of us could cause
us significant expense and reputational harm and distract senior executives from managing our normal day-to-
day operations.
Our products could also be shipped to denied parties by third parties, including our channel partners. Even
though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant import and export
regulations, any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative
consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations and penalties.
We could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the GNU General Public License and
similar licenses under which our technologies are developed and licensed are not enforceable or are
modified so as to become incompatible with other open source licenses.
A number of our offerings, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, have been developed and licensed under the
GNU General Public License and similar open source licenses. These licenses state that any program licensed
under them may be liberally copied, modified and distributed. It is possible that a court would hold these licenses
to be unenforceable or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and
distributed under them. Additionally, if any of the open source components of our offerings may not be liberally
copied, modified or distributed, then our ability to distribute or develop all or a portion of our offerings could be
adversely impacted. In addition, licensors of open source software employed in our offerings may, from time to
time, modify the terms of their license agreements in such a manner that those license terms may become
incompatible with other open source licenses in our offerings or our end user license agreement, and thus could,
among other consequences, prevent us from distributing the software code subject to the modified license.
Our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from
misappropriating our intellectual property rights in our trademarks.
Our collection of trademarks is valuable and important to our business. The protective steps we have taken
in the past may have been, and may in the future continue to be, inadequate to protect and deter misappropriation
of our trademark rights. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce,
our trademark rights in a timely manner. We have registered some of our trademarks in countries in North
America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia and have other trademark applications pending in
various countries around the world. Effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in
which we offer or intend to distribute our offerings. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring
domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary
rights. Failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy one or more of our
brands and impair our ability to compete effectively. Furthermore, defending or enforcing our trademark rights
could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
Efforts to assert intellectual property ownership rights in our technologies could impact our standing in
the open source community, which could limit our technology innovation capabilities and adversely affect
our business.
When we undertake actions to protect and maintain ownership and control over our intellectual property,
including patents, copyrights and trademark rights, our standing in the open source community could be
adversely affected as the community supports the ability to write and share code freely. This in turn could limit
our ability to continue to rely on this community, upon which we are dependent, as a resource to help develop
and improve our technologies and further our research and development efforts, and could adversely affect our
business.
