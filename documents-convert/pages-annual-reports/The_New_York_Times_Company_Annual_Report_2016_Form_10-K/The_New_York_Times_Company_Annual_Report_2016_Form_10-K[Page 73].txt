Malbaie
We have a 49% equity interest in a Canadian newsprint company, Malbaie. The other 51% is owned by Resolute
FP Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Resolute Forest Products Inc. (“Resolute”), a Delaware corporation. Resolute is a large
global manufacturer of paper, market pulp and wood products. Malbaie manufactures newsprint on the paper
machine it owns within Resolute’s paper mill in Clermont, Quebec. Malbaie is wholly dependent upon Resolute for
its pulp, which is purchased by Malbaie from Resolute’s Clermont paper mill.
We purchase newsprint from Malbaie, and previously purchased supercalendered paper from Madison, at
competitive prices. Such purchases totaled approximately $14 million in 2016, $12 million in 2015 and $20 million in
2014.
We received no distributions from Malbaie in 2016 and 2015 and $3.9 million in 2014.
