10. Other Postretirement Benefits
We provide health benefits to retired employees (and their eligible dependents) who meet the definition of an
eligible participant and certain age and service requirements, as outlined in the plan document. While we offer pre-
age 65 retiree medical coverage to employees who meet certain retiree medical eligibility requirements, we do not
provide post-age 65 retiree medical benefits for employees who retired on or after March 1, 2009. We also contribute to
a postretirement plan for Guild employees of The New York Times under the provisions of a collective bargaining
agreement. We accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees’ active years of service and our policy
is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets.

In September 2014 and December 2014, the ERISA Management Committee approved certain changes to The
New York Times Company Retiree Medical Plan provisions, which triggered a remeasurement under ASC 715-60,
“Compensation — Retirement Benefits — Defined Benefit Plans — Other Postretirement.” The changes in the plan
provisions decreased obligations by $25.5 million and the change in discount rate as of the remeasurement date
increased obligations by $3.6 million. Overall, the remeasurement decreased our obligations by $21.9 million as
reﬂected in other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income/ (Loss).
