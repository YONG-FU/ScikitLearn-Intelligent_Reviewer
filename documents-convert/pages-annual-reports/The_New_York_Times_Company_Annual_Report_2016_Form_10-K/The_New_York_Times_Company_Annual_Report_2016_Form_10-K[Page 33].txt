2015 Compared with 2014
Circulation revenues increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to growth in our digital-only
subscription base and the January 2015 print home-delivery price increase for The Times, partially offset by a
reduction in the number of print copies sold. Digital-only subscription revenues were $198.9 million in 2015
compared with $172.7 million in 2014, an increase of 15.2%.
Advertising Revenues
Advertising revenues are derived from the sale of our advertising products and services on our print, web and
mobile platforms. These revenues are primarily determined by the volume, rate and mix of advertisements. Display
advertising revenue is principally from advertisers promoting products, services or brands in print in the form of
column-inch ads, and on our web and mobile platforms in the form of banners, video, rich media and other
interactive ads. Display advertising also includes branded content on The Times’s platforms. Classified advertising
revenue includes line-ads sold in the major categories of real estate, help wanted, automotive and other. Other
advertising revenue primarily includes creative services fees associated with, among other things, our branded
content studio; revenue from preprinted advertising, also known as free-standing inserts; and revenue generated from
branded bags in which our newspapers are delivered.

2016 Compared with 2015
In 2016, total advertising revenues decreased primarily due to lower print advertising revenues. Print
advertising revenues, which represented 64% of total advertising revenues in 2016, declined 15.8% to $372.0 million in
2016 compared with $441.6 million in 2015, mainly due to a decline in display advertising, primarily in the luxury
goods, entertainment retail and technology categories.
Digital advertising revenues, which represented 36% of total advertising revenues in 2016, increased 5.9% to
$208.8 million in 2016 compared with $197.1 million in 2015 due to an increase in revenue from our mobile platform,
our programmatic buying channels and branded content distribution. Revenues from HelloSociety and Fake Love,
digital marketing agencies acquired in 2016, also contributed favorably to this increase. This increase was partially
offset by a decline in traditional desktop display advertising.
Classified advertising revenues decreased 13.4% in 2016 compared with 2015 due to a decrease in the real
estate, help wanted and other categories.
Other advertising revenues increased 34.5% in 2016 compared with 2015 due to an increase in creative services
fees related to branded content campaign launches during 2016.
