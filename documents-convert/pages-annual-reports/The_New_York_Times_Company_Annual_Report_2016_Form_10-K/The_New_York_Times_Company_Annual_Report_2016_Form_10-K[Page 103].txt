NEMG T&G, Inc.
The Company has been involved in class action litigation brought on behalf of individuals who, from 2006 to
2011, delivered newspapers at NEMG T&G, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company (”T&G”). T&G was a part of the New
England Media Group, which the Company sold in 2013. The plaintiffs asserted several claims against T&G,
including a challenge to their classification as independent contractors, and sought unspecified damages. In
December 2016, the Company reached a settlement with respect to the claims. This settlement remains subject to court
approval, and a final hearing is scheduled to take place in April 2017. As a result of the settlement, the Company
recorded a charge of $3.7 million in the fourth quarter within discontinued operations.
Other
We are involved in various legal actions incidental to our business that are now pending against us. These
actions are generally for amounts greatly in excess of the payments, if any, that may be required to be made. Although
the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in one or more
matters could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows for an individual
reporting period. However, based on currently available information, management does not believe that the ultimate
resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position.
