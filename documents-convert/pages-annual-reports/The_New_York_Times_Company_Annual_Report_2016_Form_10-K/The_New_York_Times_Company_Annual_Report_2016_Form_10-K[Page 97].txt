15. Stock-Based Awards
As of December 25, 2016, the Company was authorized to grant stock-based compensation under its 2010
Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2010 Incentive Plan”), which became effective April 27, 2010 and was amended
and restated effective April 30, 2014. The 2010 Incentive Plan replaced the 1991 Executive Stock Incentive Plan (the
“1991 Incentive Plan”). In addition, through April 30, 2014, the Company maintained its 2004 Non-Employee
Directors’ Stock Incentive Plan (the “2004 Directors’ Plan”).
The Company’s long-term incentive compensation program provides executives the opportunity to earn cash
and shares of Class A Common Stock at the end of three-year performance cycles based in part on the achievement of
financial goals tied to a financial metric and in part on stock price performance relative to companies in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Stock Index, with the majority of the target award to be settled in the Company’s Class A Common
Stock. In addition, the Company grants time-vested restricted stock units annually to a number of employees. These
are settled in shares of Class A Common Stock.
We recognize stock-based compensation expense for these stock-settled long-term performance awards and
restricted stock units, as well as any stock options and stock appreciation rights (together, “Stock-Based Awards”).
Stock-based compensation expense was $12.4 million in 2016, $10.6 million in 2015 and $8.9 million in 2014.
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date when the
award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service. Awards under the 1991 Incentive Plan
and 2010 Incentive Plan generally vest over a stated vesting period or, with respect to awards granted prior to
December 28, 2014, upon the retirement of an employee or director, as the case may be.
Prior to 2012, under our 2004 Directors’ Plan, each non-employee director of the Company received annual
grants of non-qualified stock options with 10-year terms to purchase 4,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from the
Company at the average market price of such shares on the date of grants. These grants were replaced with annual
grants of cash-settled phantom stock units in 2012, and, accordingly, no grants of stock options have since been made
under this plan. Under its terms, the 2004 Directors’ Plan terminated as of April 30, 2014.
In 2015, the annual grants of phantom stock units were replaced with annual grants of restricted stock units
under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Restricted stock units are awarded on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders
and vest on the date of the subsequent year’s annual meeting, with the shares to be delivered upon a director’s
cessation of membership on the Board of Directors. Each non-employee director is credited with additional restricted
stock units with a value equal to the amount of all dividends paid on the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The
Company’s directors are considered employees for purposes of stock-based compensation.
Our pool of excess tax benefits (“APIC Pool”) available to absorb tax deficiencies was approximately $25
million as of December 25, 2016.
Stock Options
The 1991 Incentive Plan provided, and the 2010 Incentive Plan provides, for grants of both incentive and non-
qualified stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair market value (as defined in each plan, respectively) of our
Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Stock options have generally been granted with a 3-year vesting period
and a 10-year term and vest in equal annual installments. Due to a change in the Company’s long-term incentive
compensation, no grants of stock options were made in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
The 2004 Directors’ Plan provided for grants of stock options to non-employee directors at an exercise price
equal to the fair market value (as defined in the 2004 Directors’ Plan) of our Class A Common Stock on the date of
grant. Prior to 2012, stock options were granted with a 1-year vesting period and a 10-year term. No grants of stock
options were made in 2016, 2015 or 2014. The Company’s directors are considered employees for purposes of stock-
based compensation.
