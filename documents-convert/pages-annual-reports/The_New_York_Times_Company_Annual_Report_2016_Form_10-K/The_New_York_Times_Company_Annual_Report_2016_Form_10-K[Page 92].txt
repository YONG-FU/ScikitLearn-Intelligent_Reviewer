In October 2016, the SOA released new mortality tables that decreased life expectancy assumptions. During the
fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted the new mortality tables and revised the mortality assumptions used in
determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The net impact to our qualified and non-qualified
pension obligations resulting from the new mortality assumptions in 2016 was a decrease of $1.2 million.
For fiscal year 2016, we changed the approach used to calculate the service and interest components of net
periodic benefit cost for benefit plans to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
Historically, we calculated these service and interest components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate
derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We have elected to
utilize an approach that discounts the individual expected cash ﬂows using the applicable spot rates derived from the
yield curve over the projected cash flow period. The spot rates used to determine service and interest costs ranged
from 1.32% to 4.79%. Service costs and interest costs for our postretirement plans were reduced by approximately $1
million due to the change in methodology.
11. Other Liabilities
The components of the “Other Liabilities — Other” balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:
December 25, December 27,
(In thousands) 2016 20157
lDeferred compensation $ 31,006 $ 35,578‘
Other liabilities 47,641 56,645
iTotaI $ 78,647 $ 92,223i
Deferred compensation consists primarily of deferrals under our DEC. The DEC enabled certain eligible
executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. Participation in the DEC was frozen
effective December 31, 2015, and no new contributions may be made into the plan.
We invest deferred compensation in life insurance products designed to closely mirror the performance of the
investment funds that the participants select. Our investments in life insurance products are included in
“Miscellaneous assets” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and were $34.8 million as of December 25, 2016 and $71.9
million as of December 27, 2015.
Other liabilities in the preceding table primarily included our post employment liabilities, our contingent tax
liability for uncertain tax positions and self-insurance liabilities as of December 25, 2016.
