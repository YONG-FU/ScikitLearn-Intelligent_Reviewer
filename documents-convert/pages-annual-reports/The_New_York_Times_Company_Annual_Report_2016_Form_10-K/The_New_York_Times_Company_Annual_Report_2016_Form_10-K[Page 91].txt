Weighted-average assumptions used in the actuarial computations to determine net periodic postretirement
cost were as follows:
December 25, December 27, December 28,
201 6 201 5 201 4
|Discount rate for determining projected benefit obligation 4.05% 3.74% 4.22%!
Discount rate in effect for determining service cost 4.24% 3.74% 4.22%
[Discount rate in effect for determining interest cost 2.96% 3.74% 4.22%]
Estimated increase in compensation level 3.50% 3.50% 3.50%
The assumed health-care cost trend rates were as follows:
December 25, December 27,
201 6 2015
lHeaIth-care cost trend rate 8.00% 7.20%!
Rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate) 5.00% 5.00%
[Year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2025 2023 l
Because our health-care plans are capped for most participants, the assumed health-care cost trend rates do not
have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health-care plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed
health-care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
One-Percentage Point
(In thousands) Increase Decrease
|Effect on total service and interest cost for 2016 $ 56 $ (51 )1
Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 25, 2016 $ 2,352 $ (2,061)
The following benefit payments (net of plan participant contributions) under our Company’s postretirement
plans, which reﬂect expected future services, are expected to be paid:

( 1) While benefit payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2026, we have presented in this table only those benefit
payments estimated over the next 10 years.
We accrue the cost of certain benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment, but before
retirement. The cost is recognized only when it is probable and can be estimated. Benefits include life insurance,
disability benefits and health-care continuation coverage. The accrued obligation for these benefits amounted to $11.4
million as of December 25, 2016 and $12.9 million as of December 27, 2015.
In October 2014, the SOA released new mortality tables that increased life expectancy assumptions. During the
fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted the new mortality tables and revised the mortality assumptions used in
determining our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. The net impact to our postretirement obligations
resulting from the new mortality assumptions was an increase of $4.2 million.
