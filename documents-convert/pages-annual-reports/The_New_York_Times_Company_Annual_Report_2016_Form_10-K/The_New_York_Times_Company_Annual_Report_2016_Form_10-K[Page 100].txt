L 6. Stockholders’ Equity:
Shares of our Company’s Class A and Class B Common Stock are entitled to equal participation in the event of
liquidation and in dividend declarations. The Class B Common Stock is convertible at the holders’ option on a share-
for-share basis into Class A Common Stock. Upon conversion, the previously outstanding shares of Class B Common
Stock that were converted are automatically and immediately retired, resulting in a reduction of authorized Class B
Common Stock. As provided for in our Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Class A Common Stock has
limited voting rights, including the right to elect 30% of the Board of Directors, and the Class A and Class B Common
Stock have the right to vote together on the reservation of our Company shares for stock options and other stock-
based plans, on the ratification of the selection of a registered public accounting firm and, in certain circumstances, on
acquisitions of the stock or assets of other companies. Otherwise, except as provided by the laws of the State of New
York, all voting power is vested solely and exclusively in the holders of the Class B Common Stock.
There were 816,632 shares as of December 25, 2016 and 816,635 as of December 27, 2015 of Class B Common
Stock issued and outstanding that may be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock.
The Adolph Ochs family trust holds approximately 90% of the Class B Common Stock and, as a result, has the
ability to elect 70% of the Board of Directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of
the Class A Common Stock.
On January 14, 2015, entities controlled by Carlos Slim Helu, a beneficial owner of our Class A Common Stock,
exercised warrants to purchase 15.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at a price of $6.3572 per share, and
the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $101.1 million from this exercise. Concurrently, the Board of
Directors terminated an existing authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and
approved a new repurchase authorization of $101.1 million, equal to the cash proceeds received by the Company from
the warrant exercise. As of December 25, 2016, total repurchases under this authorization totaled $84.9 million
(excluding commissions) and $16.2 million remained under this authorization. Our Board of Directors has authorized
us to purchase shares from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors. There is no expiration date
with respect to this authorization.
We may issue preferred stock in one or more series. The Board of Directors is authorized to set the
distinguishing characteristics of each series of preferred stock prior to issuance, including the granting of limited or
full voting rights; however, the consideration received must be at least $100 per share. N o shares of preferred stock
were issued or outstanding as of December 25, 2016.
