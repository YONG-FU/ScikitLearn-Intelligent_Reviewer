related to news-gathering and production activity, as well as costs related to producing branded content.
2016 Compared with 2015
Production costs increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to higher wages and benefits
(approximately $9 million) and other expenses (approximately $7 million), which consisted mainly of outside services
(approximately $9 million) and travel and entertainment (approximately $2 million), offset by lower outside printing
expenses (approximately $5 million). Newsprint expense declined 6.6% in 2016 compared with 2015, with 6.1% from
lower consumption and 0.5% from lower pricing.
2015 Compared with 2014
Production costs decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to lower raw materials expense
(approximately $12 million), which consisted mainly of newsprint and outside printing expenses (approximately $8
million). Newsprint expense declined 20.3% in 2015 compared with 2014, with 7.4% from lower consumption and
12.9% from lower pricing.
Selling, General and Administrative Costs
Selling, general and administrative costs include costs associated with the selling, marketing and distribution of
products as well as administrative expenses.
2016 Compared with 2015
Selling, general and administrative costs increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in
severance costs (approximately $12 million), compensation costs (approximately $11 million) and promotion costs
(approximately $8 million), partially offset by a decrease in non-operating retirement costs (approximately $19
million) and distribution costs (approximately $6 million). Compensation costs increased primarily as a result of
increased hiring to support growth initiatives and business acquisitions. Distribution costs decreased primarily as a
result of fewer print copies produced and lower transportation costs.
2015 Compared with 2014
Selling, general and administrative costs decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to a decrease in
severance costs (approximately $29 million) and lower distribution costs (approximately $17 million), partially offset
by an increase in compensation expense (approximately $6 million). Severance costs decreased as a result of
workforce reductions in 2014 that did not repeat in 2015. Lower distribution costs were mainly due to increased use of
lower cost vendors, transportation efficiencies and fewer print copies delivered. Compensation expense increased
primarily as a result of increased hiring to support growth initiatives.
