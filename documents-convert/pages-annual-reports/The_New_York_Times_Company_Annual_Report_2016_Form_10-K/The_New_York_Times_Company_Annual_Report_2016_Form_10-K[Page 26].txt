The following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an
assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition as of December 25, 2016, and results of
operations for the three years ended December 25, 2016. This item should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included in this Annual Report.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global media organization that includes newspapers, print and digital products and investments. We
have one reportable segment with businesses that include our newspapers, websites, mobile applications and related
businesses.
We generate revenues principally from circulation and advertising. Other revenues primarily consist of
revenues from news services/ syndication, digital archives, rental income, our NYT Live business, e-commerce and
affiliate referrals. Our main operating costs are employee-related costs.
In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we present certain information derived from
consolidated financial information but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We are presenting in this report
supplemental non-GAAP financial performance measures that exclude depreciation, amortization, severance, non-
operating retirement costs and certain identified special items, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and should be read in
conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. For further information and reconciliations of
these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see "—Results of Operations—Non-
GAAP Financial Measures.”
2016 Financial Highlights
In 2016, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.19, compared with $0.38 for 2015.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding severance, non-operating retirement costs and
special items discussed below (or “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” a non-GAAP measure) were $0.57 for 2016,
compared with $0.71 for 2015.
Operating profit in 2016 was $101.6 million, compared with $136.6 million for 2015. The decline was driven by
lower print advertising revenue and higher costs. Operating profit before depreciation, amortization, severance, non-
operating retirement costs and special items discussed below (or “adjusted operating profit,” a non-GAAP measure)
was $240.9 million for 2016, compared with $289.0 million for 2015.
Total revenues decreased slightly in 2016 to $1.56 billion, compared with $1.58 billion in 2015. This was driven
by declines in advertising revenues, partially offset by growth in circulation and other revenues.
Compared with 2015, circulation revenues increased 3.4% in 2016, as digital subscription growth and a print
home-delivery price increase at The Times more than offset a decline in the number of print copies sold. Circulation
revenues from our digital-only subscription packages increased 17% in 2016 compared with 2015.
Paid digital-only subscriptions totaled approximately 1,853,000 as of December 25, 2016, a 46% increase
compared with year-end 2015. We saw a significant increase in the number of paid digital-only subscriptions to our
news products following the 2016 presidential election. Given that this increase occurred late in 2016, the revenue
generated from these subscriptions is expected to be reﬂected more fully in 2017.
Advertising revenues remained under pressure during 2016. Total advertising revenues decreased 9.1% in 2016
compared with 2015, reflecting a 15.8% decrease in print advertising revenues that was primarily driven by a decline
in display advertising. This was partially offset by a 5.9% increase in digital advertising revenues that was primarily
driven by increased revenue from our mobile platform, our programmatic buying channels and branded content
distribution.
Compared with 2015, other revenues increased 6.0% in 2016, largely due to affiliate referral revenue associated
with product review and recommendation websites, The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, which the Company
acquired in October 2016, as well as from our NYT Live business.
