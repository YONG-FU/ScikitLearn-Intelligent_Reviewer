Long-Term Incentive Compensation
The 1991 Incentive Plan provided, and the 2010 Incentive Plan provides, for grants of cash and stock-settled
awards to key executives payable at the end of a multi-year performance period.
Cash-settled awards have been granted with three-year performance periods and are based on the achievement
of specified financial performance measures. Cash-settled awards have been classified as a liability because we
incurred a liability payable in cash. There were payments of approximately $4 million in 2016, $3 million in 2015 and
$1 million in 2014.
Stock-settled awards have been granted with three-year performance periods and are based on relative Total
Shareholder Return (“TSR”), which is calculated at stock appreciation plus deemed reinvested dividends, and another
performance measure. Stock-settled awards are payable in Class A Common Stock and are classified within equity.
The fair value of TSR awards is determined at the date of grant using a market calculation simulation. The fair value
of awards under the other performance measure is determined by the average market price on the grant date.
Compensation expense for TSR-based awards is recognized based on the fair value on the grant date using a
Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for the other performance measure is based on the expected
number of shares or cash to be delivered as of each reporting date.
Unrecognized Compensation Expense
As of December 25, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of our Stock-
Based Awards was approximately $14 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.41 years.
