Contractual Obligations
The information provided is based on management’s best estimate and assumptions of our contractual
obligations as of December 25, 2016. Actual payments in future periods may vary from those reﬂected in the table.

(1 ) Includes estimated interest payments on long-term debt. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information related to our debt.
(2) See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our capital and operating leases.
(3) The Company's general funding policy with respect to qualified pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy the
minimum amount required by applicable law and regulations. Contributions for our qualified pension plans and future beneﬁt payments for
our unfunded pension and other postretirement beneﬁt payments have been estimated over a 10-year period; therefore, the amounts included
in the “Later Years”column only include payments for the period of 2022-2026. For our funded qualified pension plans, estimating funding
depends on several variables, including the performance of the plans' investments, assumptions for discount rates, expected long-term rates
of return on assets, rates of compensation increases and other factors. Thus, our actual contributions could vary substantially from these
estimates. While beneﬁt payments under these plans are expected to continue beyond 2026, we have included in this table only those beneﬁt
payments estimated over the next 10 years. Beneﬁt plans in the table above also include estimated payments for multiemployer pension plan
withdrawal liabilities. See Notes 9 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our
pension and other postretirement benefits plans.
“Other Liabilities — Other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets include liabilities related to (1) deferred
compensation, primarily related to our deferred executive compensation plan (the ”DEC”), (2) uncertain tax positions
and (3) various other liabilities. These liabilities are not included in the table above primarily because the future
payments are not determinable.
The DEC enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis.
The deferred amounts are invested at the executives’ option in various mutual funds. The fair value of deferred
compensation is based on the mutual fund investments elected by the executives and on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets. The DEC was frozen effective December 31, 2015, and no new contributions may be made
into the plan. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on “Other
Liabilities — Other. ”
Our liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately $13.0 million, including approximately $4.0 million
of accrued interest and penalties as of December 25, 2016. Until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax
authorities, the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is not practicable.
Therefore, we do not include this obligation in the table of contractual obligations. See Note 12 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on “Income Taxes.”
We have a contract through the end of 2017 with Resolute, a major paper supplier, to purchase newsprint. The
contract requires us to purchase annually the lesser of a fixed number of tons or a percentage of our total newsprint
requirement at market rate in an arm’s length transaction. Since the quantities of newsprint purchased annually under
this contract are based on our total newsprint requirement, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is
excluded from the table above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 25, 2016.
