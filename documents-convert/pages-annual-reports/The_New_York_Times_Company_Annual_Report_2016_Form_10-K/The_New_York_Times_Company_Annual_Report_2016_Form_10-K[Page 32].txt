Circulation Revenues
Circulation revenues consist of revenues from our print and digital products, including our digital-only
subscription packages, e-readers and replica editions. These revenues are based on the number of copies of the
printed newspaper sold (through home-delivery subscriptions and single-copy and bulk sales) and digital-only
subscriptions and the rates charged to the respective customers. All print home-delivery subscribers receive unlimited
digital access.
In the first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified the subscription revenue from its Crossword product,
including prior period information, into circulation revenues from other revenues. The following tables summarize
digital-only subscription revenues reﬂecting this reclassification:

2016 Compared with 2015
Circulation revenues increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to growth in our digital-only
subscription base and the January 2016 print home-delivery price increase for The Times, partially offset by a
reduction in the number of print copies sold. Digital-only subscription revenues were $232.8 million in 2016
compared with $198.9 million in 2015, an increase of 17.0%.
