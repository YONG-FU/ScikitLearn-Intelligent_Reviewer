Newspaper and Mail Deliverers — Publishers’ Pension Fund
In September 2013, the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers-Publishers’ Pension Fund (the “NMDU Fund”)
assessed a partial withdrawal liability against the Company in the gross amount of approximately $26 million for the
plan years ending May 31, 2012 and 2013 (the "Initial Assessment”), an amount that was increased to a gross amount
of approximately $34 million in December 2014, when the NMDU Fund issued a revised partial withdrawal liability
assessment for the plan year ending May 31, 2013 (the “Revised Assessment”). The NMDU Fund claimed that when
City 8: Suburban Delivery Systems, Inc., a retail and newsstand distribution subsidiary of the Company and the
largest contributor to the NMDU Fund, ceased operations in 2009, it triggered a decline of more than 70% in
contribution base units in each of these two plan years.
The Company disagreed with both the NMDU Fund’s determination that a partial withdrawal occurred and
the methodology by which it calculated the withdrawal liability, and the parties engaged in arbitration proceedings to
resolve the matter. On June 14, 2016, the arbitrator issued an interim opinion and award that supported the NMDU
Fund’s determination that a partial withdrawal had occurred, including concluding that the methodology used to
calculate the Initial Assessment was correct. However, the arbitrator also concluded that the NMDU Fund’s
calculation of the Revised Assessment was incorrect. The Company expects to appeal the arbitrator’s decision
following the issuance of the final opinion and award.
Due to requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 that sponsors make payments
demanded by plans during arbitration and any resultant appeals, the Company had been making payments to the
NMDU Fund since September 2013 relating to the Initial Assessment and February 2015 relating to the Revised
Assessment based on the NMDU Fund’s demand. As a result, as of December 25, 2016, we have paid $11.7 million
relating to the Initial Assessment since the receipt of the initial demand letter. We also paid $5.0 million relating to the
Revised Assessment, which was refunded in July 2016 based on the arbitrator’s ruling. Amounts recognized as
expense were $10.7 million (including $6.7 million resulting from the interim decision (see Note 9 for more
information)), $6.8 million and $3.6 million for the fiscal years ended December 25, 2016, December 27, 2015 and
December 28, 2014, respectively.
As a result of the interim opinion and award relating to the Initial Assessment, the Company had a liability of
$9.7 million as of December 25, 2016. Management believes it is reasonably possible that the total loss in this matter
could exceed the liability established by a range of zero to approximately $10.0 million.
