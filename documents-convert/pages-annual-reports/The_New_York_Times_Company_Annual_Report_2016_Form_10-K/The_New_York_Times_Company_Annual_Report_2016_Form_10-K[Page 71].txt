Company Ownership
jDonohue Malbaie Inc. 49%j
Madison Paper Industries 40%
jWomen in the World Media, LLC 30%j
We have investments in Donohue Malbaie Inc. (“Malbaie”), a Canadian newsprint company, Madison Paper
Industries (“Madison”), a partnership that previously operated a supercalendered paper mill in Maine, and Women in
the World Media, LLC, a live-event conference business.
Our investments above are accounted for under the equity method, and are recorded in “Investments in joint
ventures” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our proportionate shares of the operating results of our investments
are recorded in “Loss from joint ventures” in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in “Investments in joint
ventures” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In 2016, we had a loss from joint ventures of $36.3 million compared with a loss of $0.8 million in 2015. The
increase was primarily due to losses related to the shutdown of the Madison paper mill, as described below, partially
offset by increased income from our investment in Malbaie, which benefited from higher newsprint prices and the
impact of a significantly weakened Canadian dollar.
In 2015, we had a loss from joint ventures of $0.8 million compared with a loss of $8.4 million in 2014. The
improvement reflected an impairment charge of $9.2 million ($4.7 million after adjusting for tax and the allocation of
the loss to the non-controlling interest) in 2014 related to our investment in Madison, as well as increased income from
our investment in Malbaie, which benefited from higher newsprint prices and the impact of a significantly weakened
Canadian dollar. This was partially offset by losses from our investment in Madison, which continued to face
