In March 2016, UPM, the Company’s partner in the Madison joint venture investment, announced the closure of
Madison’s paper mill, which occurred in May 2016. As a result of this closure, we recognized $41.4 million in losses
from joint ventures, wrote our investment down to zero and recorded a liability of $28.3 million, reﬂecting both our
share of the impairment and losses incurred in 2016 by Madison and our funding obligation. These amounts are
presented in “Accrued expenses and other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s joint venture in
Madison is currently being liquidated and a plan is in place to sell assets (including hydro power assets) at the mill
site. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Madison sold its non-hydro power assets at the mill site and we recognized a gain
of $3.9 million related to the sale. We expect the sale of the hydro power assets to be completed in early 2017 and
believe the proceeds from the sale will be more than sufficient to cover Madison’s obligations and therefore allow us
to reverse our liability. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on this
joint venture investment, including summarized financial information.

Qperating Activities
Cash from operating activities is generated by cash receipts from circulation, advertising sales and other
revenue. Operating cash outﬂows include payments for employee compensation, pension and other benefits, raw
materials, interest and income taxes.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015 due to higher income tax
payments, higher employee compensation payments, higher marketing costs and an overall decline in revenues. We
made income tax payments of approximately $45 million in 2016 compared with approximately $21 million in 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2015 compared with 2014 due to an increase in operating
performance, lower pension contributions and lower interest payments.
Investing Activities
Cash from investing activities generally includes proceeds from marketable securities that have matured and
the sale of assets, investments or a business. Cash used in investing activities generally includes purchases of
marketable securities, payments for capital projects, restricted cash (the majority of which is set aside to collateralize
workers’ compensation obligations), acquisitions of new businesses and investments.
Net cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily due to maturities of marketable securities, offset
by purchases of marketable securities and a cash distribution of $38.0 million from the liquidation of certain
investments related to our corporate-owned life insurance, consideration paid for acquisitions of $40.4 million and
payments for capital expenditures of $30.1 million.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily due to maturities of marketable securities, offset by
purchases of marketable securities and payments for capital expenditures.
Net cash used in investing activities in 2014 was primarily due to purchases of marketable securities, payments
for capital expenditures and changes in restricted cash. Additionally during 2014, net cash used in investing activities
included the repayment of approximately $26 million of loans taken against the cash value of our corporate-owned
life insurance policies.
