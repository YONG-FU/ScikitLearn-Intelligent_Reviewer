Based upon our initial evaluation, we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material effect on
our financial condition or results of operations. While we continue to evaluate the impact of the new revenue
guidance, we currently believe that the most significant changes will be primarily related to how we account for
certain licensing arrangements in the other revenue category. However, preliminary assessments may be subject to
change.
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all recently issued accounting pronouncements. Recent
accounting pronouncements not specifically identified in our disclosures are either not applicable to the Company or
are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

4. Goodwill and Intangibles
During the first and third quarters of 2016, the Company acquired two digital marketing agencies, HelloSociety,
LLC and Fake Love, LLC, for an aggregate of $15.4 million, in all-cash transactions. The Company allocated the
purchase prices based on the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulting in allocations to goodwill,
intangibles, property, plant and equipment and other miscellaneous assets.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company acquired Submarine Leisure Club, Inc., which owns the
product review and recommendation websites The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, in an all-cash transaction. We
paid $25.0 million, including a payment made for a non-compete agreement. In connection with the transaction, we
also entered into a consulting agreement and retention agreements that will likely require payments over the three
years following the acquisition.
The Company has preliminarily allocated the purchase price of Submarine Leisure Club, Inc. to acquired net
assets, goodwill and intangibles pending the completion of the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The final asset and liability fair values may differ from those included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet
