(1 ) Includes the assets of The Guild-Times Adjustable Pension Plan and the RetirementAnnuity Plan which are not part of the Master Trust.
(2) The underlying assets of the common/collective funds are primarily comprised of equity and ﬁxed income securities. The fair value in the
above table represents our ownership share of the net asset value (“NAV”) of the underlying funds.
(3) Represents investments that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
(4) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value
hierarchy.
Level 1 and Level 2 Investments
Where quoted prices are available in an active market for identical assets, such as equity securities traded on an
exchange, transactions for the asset occur with such frequency that the pricing information is available on an
ongoing / daily basis. We classify these types of investments as Level 1 Where the fair value represents the closing / last
trade price for these particular securities.
For our investments Where pricing data may not be readily available, fair values are estimated by using quoted
prices for similar assets, in both active and not active markets, and observable inputs, other than quoted prices, such
as interest rates and credit risk. We classify these types of investments as Level 2 because we are able to reasonably
estimate the fair value through inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. There are no restrictions on our
ability to sell any of our Level 1 and Level 2 investments.
