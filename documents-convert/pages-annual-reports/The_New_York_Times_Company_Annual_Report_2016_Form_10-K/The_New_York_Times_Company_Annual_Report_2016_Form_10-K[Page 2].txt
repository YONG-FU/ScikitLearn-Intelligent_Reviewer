On the strength of revenue growth from our mobile platform, programmatic buying channels and branded
content, we saw a meaningful increase in digital advertising revenue for 2016. We are committed to
continuing this growth while managing the continued secular declines in print advertising and legacy parts
of digital advertising.
One significant transformation in 2017 will be the way we use our headquarters building at 620 Eighth
Avenue. We plan to invest in a redesign of our existing space to create a more dynamic, collaborative and
open workplace. As part of this plan, the company will reduce the number of floors that we occupy, allowing
us to generate additional rental income on those floors.
Looking ahead, we will continue to keep a sharp focus on our cost base, while investing where appropriate
to support growth. At the same time, we remain deeply committed to protecting our investment in the
original newsgathering and storytelling that make The Times so indispensable.
In the coming months, with the support of our board and relying on the dedication of our colleagues in every
corner of the world, we will continue to execute our strategy of producing the world’s finest journalism
along with innovative products and services to bring that journalism to the world. We remain committed to
doubling our digital revenue by 2020, growing the company’s profitability in the long term and increasing
shareholder value.
We thank you for your continued support.
