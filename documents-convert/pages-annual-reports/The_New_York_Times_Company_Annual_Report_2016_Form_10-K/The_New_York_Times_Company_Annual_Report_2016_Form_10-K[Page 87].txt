Our participation in significant plans for the fiscal period ended December 25, 2016, is outlined in the table
below. The “EIN / Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the
three-digit plan number. The zone status is based on the latest information that we received from the plan and is
certified by the plan’s actuary. A plan is generally classified in critical status if a funding deficiency is projected within
four years or five years. A plan in critical status is classified in critical and declining status if it is projected to become
insolvent in the next 15 or 20 years, depending on other criteria. A plan is classified in endangered status if its funded
percentage is less than 80% or a funding deficiency is projected within seven years. If the plan satisfies both of these
triggers, it is classified in seriously endangered status. A plan not classified in any other status is classified in the
green zone. The “FTP / RP Status Pending / Implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement
plan (“PIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented. The “Surcharge Imposed”
column includes plans in a red zone status that are required to pay a surcharge in excess of regular contributions. The
last column lists the expiration date(s) of the collective bargaining agreement(s) to which the plans are subject.

(1 ) There are two collective bargaining agreements requiring contributions to this plan, Mailers expire March 30, 2019 and Typographers expired
March 30, 2016.
(2) Elections under the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010: Extended Amortization of Net
Investment Losses (IRS Section 431(b)(8)(A)) and the Expanded Smoothing Period (IRS Section 431(b)(8)(B)).
(3) We previously had two collective bargaining agreements requiring contributions to this plan. With the sale of the New England Media Group
only one collective bargaining agreement remains for the Stereotypers, which expires March 30, 2021. The method for calculating actuarial
value of assets was changed retroactive to January 1, 2009, as elected by the Board of Trustees and as permitted by IRS Notice 2010-83. This
election includes smoothing 2008 investment losses over ten years.
(4) The Plan sponsor elected two provisions of funding relief under the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension
Relief Act of 2010 (PRA 2010) to more slowly absorb the 2008 plan year investment loss, retroactively effective as of April 1, 2009. These
included extended amortization under the prospective method and 10-year smoothing of the asset loss for the plan year beginning April 1,
2008.
(5) Board of Trustees elected funding relief. This election includes smoothing the March 31, 2009 investment losses over 10 years.
The rehabilitation plan for the GClU-Employer Retirement Benefit Plan includes minimum annual
contributions no less than the total annual contribution made by us from September 1, 2008 through August 31, 2009.
