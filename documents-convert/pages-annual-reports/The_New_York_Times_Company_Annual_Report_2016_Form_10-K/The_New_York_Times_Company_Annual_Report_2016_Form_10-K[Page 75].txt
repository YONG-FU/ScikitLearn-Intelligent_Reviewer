6.625% Notes
In November 2010, we issued $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due
December 15, 2016 ("6.625% Notes”). During 2014, we repurchased $18.4 million principal amount of the 6.625%
Notes and recorded a $2.2 million pre-tax charge in connection with the repurchases. In December 2016, the Company
repaid, at maturity, the remaining principal amount of the 6.625% Notes.
Sale-Leaseback Financing
In March 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell and simultaneously lease back a portion of our leasehold
condominium interest in our Company’s headquarters building located at 620 Eighth Avenue in New York City (the
“Condo Interest”). The sale price for the Condo Interest was $225.0 million less transaction costs, for net proceeds of
approximately $211 million. The lease term is 15 years, and we have three renewal options that could extend the term
for an additional 20 years. We have an option, exercisable in 2019, to repurchase the Condo Interest for $250.0 million,
which we currently expect to exercise.
The transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction. As such, we have continued to depreciate the Condo
Interest and account for the rental payments as interest expense. The difference between the purchase option price of
$250.0 million and the net sale proceeds of approximately $211 million, or approximately $39 million, is being
amortized over a 10-year period through interest expense. The effective interest rate on this transaction was
approximately 13%.

International Print Operations
On April 26, 2016, we informed employees of proposed measures intended to streamline our international print
operations and support future growth efforts. These measures included a redesign of our international print
newspaper and the relocation of certain editing and production operations from Paris to our locations in Hong Kong
and New York. As of December 25, 2016, we incurred $14.8 million of total costs related to these measures, primarily
related to relocation and severance charges. Cash disbursements of $5.6 million were made in 2016.
Severance Costs
We recognized severance costs, other than those associated with the streamlining of the Company’s
international print operations, of $18.8 million in 2016, $7.0 million in 2015 and $36.1 million in 2014. The majority of
the 2015 costs related to workforce reductions. These costs are recorded in "Selling, general and administrative costs”
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We had a severance liability of $23.2 million and $14.9 million included in “Accrued expenses and other” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively.
