The funded status of our qualified and non-qualified pension plans as of December 25, 2016 is as follows:

We made contributions of approximately $8 million to certain qualified pension plans in 2016. We expect
contributions to total approximately $9 million to satisfy minimum funding requirements in 2017.
Pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of
return on assets (for qualified plans) and a discount rate. Our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is
discussed below.
In determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we evaluated input from our investment
consultants, actuaries and investment management firms, including our review of asset class return expectations, as
well as long-term historical asset class returns. Projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on
broad equity and bond indices. Our objective is to select an average rate of earnings expected on existing plan assets
and expected contributions to the plan (less plan expenses to be incurred) during the year. The expected long-term
rate of return determined on this basis was 7.00% at the beginning of 2016. Our plan assets had an average rate of
return of approximately 10.36% in 2016 and an average annual return of approximately 6.85% over the three-year
period 2014-2016. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to meet
our investment strategy.
The market-related value of plan assets is multiplied by the expected long-term rate of return on assets to
compute the expected return on plan assets, a component of net periodic pension cost. The market-related value of
plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over three years.
Based on the composition of our assets at the end of the year, we estimated our 2017 expected long-term rate of
return to be 6.75%. If we had decreased our expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets by 50 basis points to
6.50% in 2016, pension expense would have increased by approximately $8 million in 2016 for our qualified pension
plans. Our funding requirements would not have been materially affected.
We determined our discount rate using a Ryan ALM, Inc. Curve (the “Ryan Curve”). The Ryan Curve provides
the bonds included in the curve and allows adjustments for certain outliers (i.e., bonds on ”watch”). We believe the
Ryan Curve allows us to calculate an appropriate discount rate.
To determine our discount rate, we project a cash ﬂow based on annual accrued benefits. For active
participants, the benefits under the respective pension plans are projected to the date of termination. The projected
plan cash ﬂow is discounted to the measurement date, which is the last day of our fiscal year, using the annual spot
rates provided in the Ryan Curve. A single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash
ﬂow equals the present value computed using the Ryan Curve rates.
The weighted-average discount rate determined on this basis was 4.31% for our qualified plans and 4.17% for
our non-qualified plans as of December 25, 2016.
If we had decreased the expected discount rate by 50 basis points for our qualified plans and our non-qualified
plans in 2016, pension expense would have increased by approximately $1 million as of December 25, 2016 and our
pension obligation would have increased by approximately $124 million.
We will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions, generally on an annual basis, and will adjust as
necessary. Actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates,
the level of contributions we make and various other factors.
We also recognize the present value of pension liabilities associated with the withdrawal from multiemployer
pension plans. Our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability was approximately $113 million as of
