Our principal executive offices are located in our New York headquarters building in the Times Square area.
The building was completed in 2007 and consists of approximately 1.54 million gross square feet, of which
approximately 828,000 gross square feet of space have been allocated to us. We owned a leasehold condominium
interest representing approximately 58% of the New York headquarters building until March 2009, when we entered
into an agreement to sell and simultaneously lease back 21 ﬂoors, or approximately 750,000 rentable square feet,
currently occupied by us (the “Condo Interest”). The sale price for the Condo Interest was $225.0 million. The lease
term is 15 years, and we have three renewal options that could extend the term for an additional 20 years. We have an
option exercisable in 2019 to repurchase the Condo Interest for $250.0 million, and we currently expect that we will
exercise this option.We continue to own a leasehold condominium interest in seven ﬂoors in our New York
headquarters building, totaling approximately 216,000 rentable square feet that were not included in the sale-
leaseback transaction, all of which are currently leased to third parties.
In December 2016, we announced a plan to consolidate the Company’s operations in our headquarters building
from the 17 ﬂoors we currently occupy to nine by the end of 2017. We plan to lease the remaining eight floors to third
parties. This will require the temporary relocation of a number of employees to office space elsewhere in New York
while we reconfigure the space. We believe this plan will further enhance the value of our headquarters building.
In addition, we have a printing and distribution facility with 570,000 gross square feet located in College Point,
NY, on a 31-acre site owned by the City of New York for which we have a ground lease. We have an option to
purchase the property at any time before the lease ends in 2019 for $6.9 million. As of December 25, 2016, we also
owned other properties with an aggregate of approximately 3,000 gross square feet and leased other properties with
an aggregate of approximately 209,200 rentable square feet in various locations.

We are involved in various legal actions incidental to our business that are now pending against us. These
actions are generally for amounts greatly in excess of the payments, if any, that may be required to be made. See Note
18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain matters, which is incorporated
herein by reference. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, it is possible that an
unfavorable outcome in one or more matters could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or
cash ﬂows for an individual reporting period. However, based on currently available information, management does
not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, is likely to have a material
effect on the Company’s financial position.
