Regional Media Group
In the first quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of the Regional Media Group, consisting of 16 regional
newspapers, other print publications and related businesses, to Halifax Media Holdings LLC for approximately
$140.0 million in cash. The net after-tax proceeds from the sale, including a tax benefit, were approximately $150.0
million. The sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $23.6 million (including post-closing adjustments recorded in the
second and fourth quarters of 2012 totaling $6.6 million). In the fourth quarter of 2014, there was an environmental
contingency that resulted in a loss of $0.4 million. The results of operations for the Regional Media Group have been
classified as discontinued operations for 2014.
The results of operations for the New England Media Group, About Group and the Regional Media Group
presented as discontinued operations are summarized below for 2016 and 2014. There were no discontinued
operations in 2015.

14. Earnings:/(Loss) Per Share
We compute earnings/ (loss) per share using a two-class method, an earnings allocation method used when a
company’s capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating
securities. This method determines earnings / (loss) per share based on dividends declared on common stock and
participating securities (i.e., distributed earnings), as well as participation rights of participating securities in any
undistributed earnings.
Earnings/ (loss) per share is computed using both basic shares and diluted shares. The difference between basic
and diluted shares is that diluted shares include the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of outstanding securities.
Our stock options, stock-settled long-term performance awards and restricted stock units could have the most
significant impact on diluted shares. The decrease in our basic shares is primarily due to repurchases of the
Company’s Class A Common Stock.
Securities that could potentially be dilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share
when a loss from continuing operations exists or when the exercise price exceeds the market value of our Class A
Common Stock, because their inclusion would result in an anti-dilutive effect on per share amounts.
The number of stock options excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because they were
anti-dilutive was approximately 4 million in 2016, 5 million in 2015 and 6 million in 2014.
