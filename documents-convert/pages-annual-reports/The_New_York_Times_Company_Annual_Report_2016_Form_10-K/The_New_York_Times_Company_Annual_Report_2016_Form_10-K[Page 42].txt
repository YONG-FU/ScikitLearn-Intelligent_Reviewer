Our primary sources of cash inﬂows from operations were revenues from circulation and advertising sales.
Circulation and advertising revenues provided about 57% and 37%, respectively, of total revenues in 2016. The
remaining cash inﬂows were primarily from other revenue sources such as news services / syndication, digital
archives, rental income, our NYT Live business, e-commerce and affiliate referrals.
Our primary sources of cash outflows were for our repayment of debt, employee compensation and benefits,
other operating expenses and interest, dividend and income tax payments. We believe our cash and cash equivalents,
and marketable securities balance and cash provided by operations, in combination with other sources of cash, will be
sufficient to meet our financing needs over the next 12 months.
We have continued to strengthen our liquidity position and our debt profile. As of December 25, 2016, we had
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $737.5 million and total debt and capital lease obligations of $247.0
million. Accordingly, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities exceeded total debt and capital lease
obligations by $490.5 million. Our cash and investment balances declined in 2016 primarily due to the repayment, at
maturity, of the $189.2 million remaining principal amount under our 6.625% senior notes in December 2016 (the
“6.625% Notes”) and consideration paid for business acquisitions.
On January 14, 2015, entities controlled by Carlos Slim Helu, a beneficial owner of our Class A Common Stock,
exercised warrants to purchase 15.9 million shares of our Class A Common Stock at a price of $6.3572 per share, and
the Company received cash proceeds of approximately $101.1 million from this exercise. Concurrently, the Board of
Directors terminated an existing authorization to repurchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and
approved a new repurchase authorization of $101.1 million, equal to the cash proceeds received by the Company from
the warrant exercise. As of December 25, 2016, total repurchases under this authorization totaled $84.9 million
(excluding commissions) and $16.2 million remained under this authorization. Our Board of Directors has authorized
us to purchase shares from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors. There is no expiration date
with respect to this authorization.
We have paid quarterly dividends of $0.04 per share on the Class A and Class B Common Stock since late 2013.
We currently expect to continue to pay comparable cash dividends in the future, although changes in our dividend
program will be considered by our Board of Directors in light of our earnings, capital requirements, financial
condition and other factors considered relevant. In addition, the Board of Directors will consider restrictions in any
existing indebtedness.
During 2016, we made contributions of approximately $8 million to certain qualified pension plans. We expect
contributions to total approximately $9 million to satisfy minimum funding requirements in 2017.
