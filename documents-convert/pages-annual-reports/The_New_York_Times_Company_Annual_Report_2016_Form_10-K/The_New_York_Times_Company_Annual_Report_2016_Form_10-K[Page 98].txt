The total intrinsic value for stock options exercised was $0.7 million in 2016, $2.7 million in 2015 and $1.5
million in 2014.
The fair value of the stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation
model that uses the following assumptions. The risk-free rate is based on the US. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant. The expected life (estimated period of time outstanding) of stock options granted was determined using
the average of the vesting period and term. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility for a period equal to
the stock option’s expected life, ending on the date of grant, and calculated on a monthly basis. Dividend yield was
based on expected Company dividends, if applicable on the date of grant. The fair value for stock options granted
with different vesting periods and on different dates is calculated separately.
Restricted Stock Units
The 1991 Incentive Plan provided, and the 2010 Incentive Plan provides, for grants of other stock-based awards,
including restricted stock units.
Outstanding stock-settled restricted stock units have been granted with a stated vesting period up to 5 years.
Each restricted stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of Class A Common Stock upon
vesting. The fair value of stock-settled restricted stock units is the average market price on the grant date. Changes in
our Company’s stock-settled restricted stock units in 2016 were as follows:
