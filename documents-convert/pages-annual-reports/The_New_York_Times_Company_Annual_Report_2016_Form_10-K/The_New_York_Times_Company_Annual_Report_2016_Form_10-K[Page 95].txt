A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

lBaIance at end of year $ 10,028 $ 13,941 $ 16,324‘
In 2016 and 2015, we recorded a $4.5 million and $2.5 million income tax benefit, respectively, primarily due to a
reduction in the Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions.
The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would, if recognized, affect the effective income tax rate was
approximately $7 million as of December 25, 2016 and $9 million as of December 27, 2015.
We also recognize accrued interest expense and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits within income
tax expense or benefit. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties was approximately $3 million and $4 million
as of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties was a
net benefit of $0.9 million in 2016, a net benefit of $0.1 million in 2015 and a net benefit of $8.6 million in 2014.
With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008. Management believes that our accrual for tax liabilities is
adequate for all open audit years. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of
complex judgments about future events.
It is reasonably possible that certain income tax examinations may be concluded, or statutes of limitation may
lapse, during the next 12 months, which could result in a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $3.6 million that
would, if recognized, impact the effective tax rate.
13. Discontinued Operations
New England Media Group
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and operating liabilities of
the New England Media Group — consisting of The Boston Globe, BostonGlobe.com, Boston.com, the T&G,
Telegram.com and related properties — and our 49% equity interest in Metro Boston, for approximately $70.0 million
in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The net after-tax proceeds from the sale, including a tax benefit, were
approximately $74.0 million. In 2013, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $47.6 million on the sale ($28.1 million after tax),
which was almost entirely comprised of a curtailment gain. This curtailment gain was primarily related to an
acceleration of prior service credits from retiree medical plan amendments announced in prior years, and was due to
a cessation of service for employees at the New England Media Group. Post-closing adjustments in 2014 resulted in a
loss of $0.3 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a charge of $3.7 million ($2.3 million after tax) in
connection with the settlement of litigation involving NEMG T&G, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company that was part of
the New England Media Group. The results of operations of the New England Media Group have been classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.
About Group
In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the sale of the About Group, consisting of Aboutcom,
ConsumerSearch.com, CalorieCount.com and related businesses, to IAC/InterActiveCorp. for $300.0 million in cash,
plus a net working capital adjustment of approximately $17.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $96.7
million ($61.9 million after tax) in 2012. The net after-tax proceeds from the sale were approximately $291.0 million. In
the fourth quarter of 2014, there was a legal settlement that resulted in a loss of $0.2 million. The results of operations
