Cash Flows
In August 2014, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 was enacted. The legislation extended
interest rate stabilization for single-employer defined benefit pension plan funding for an additional five years. In
2016, we made contributions to qualified pension plans of $7.8 million. We expect contributions to total
approximately $9 million to satisfy minimum funding requirements in 2017.
The following benefit payments, which reﬂect future service for plans that have not been frozen, are expected to
be paid:

payments estimated over the next 10 years.
Multiemployer Plans
We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of various
collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. In recent years, certain events, such as
amendments to various collective bargaining agreements and the sale of the New England Media Group, resulted in
withdrawals from multiemployer pension plans. These actions, along with a reduction in covered employees, have
resulted in us estimating withdrawal liabilities to the respective plans for our proportionate share of any unfunded
vested benefits. In 2016 and 2015, we recorded $6.7 million and $9.1 million in charges for partial withdrawal
obligations under multiemployer pension plans, respectively. There was no such charge in 2014.
Our multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability was approximately $113 million as of December 25, 2016
and approximately $124 million as of December 27, 2015. The decrease was due to the settlement of various
withdrawal liabilities in 2016. This liability represents the present value of the obligations related to complete and
partial withdrawals that have already occurred as well as an estimate of future partial withdrawals that we
considered probable and reasonably estimable. For those plans that have yet to provide us with a demand letter, the
actual liability will not be fully known until they complete a final assessment of the withdrawal liability and issue a
demand to us. Therefore, the estimate of our multiemployer pension plan liability will be adjusted as more
information becomes available that allows us to refine our estimates.
The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following
aspects:
0 Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees
of other participating employers.
0 If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne
by the remaining participating employers.
o If we elect to withdraw from these plans or if we trigger a partial withdrawal due to declines in contribution
base units or a partial cessation of our obligation to contribute, we may be assessed a withdrawal liability
based on a calculated share of the underfunded status of the plan.
0 If a multiemployer plan from which we have withdrawn subsequently experiences a mass withdrawal, we
may be required to make additional contributions under applicable law.
