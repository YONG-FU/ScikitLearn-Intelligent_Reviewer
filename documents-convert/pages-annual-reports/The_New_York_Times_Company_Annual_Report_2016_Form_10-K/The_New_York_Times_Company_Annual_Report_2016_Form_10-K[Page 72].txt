declining demand for supercalendered paper and was at a competitive disadvantage to Canadian mills selling paper
to the United States, which benefited from the Canadian dollar value decline.
Madison
The Company and UPM-Kymmene Corporation (“UPM”), a Finnish paper manufacturing company, are
partners through subsidiary companies in Madison. The Company’s 40% ownership of Madison is through an 80%-
owned consolidated subsidiary that owns 50% of Madison. UPM owns 60% of Madison, including a 10% interest
through a 20% noncontrolling interest in the consolidated subsidiary of the Company. In March 2016, UPM
announced the closure of the paper mill, which occurred in May 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, we recognized
$41.4 million in losses from joint ventures related to the announced closure of the paper mill. Our proportionate share
of the loss is reduced by the 20% noncontrolling interest. As a result of the mill closure, we wrote our investment
down to zero and recorded a liability of $28.3 million, reﬂecting our share of the impairment and losses incurred in
2016 by Madison and our funding obligation. These amounts are presented in “Accrued expenses and other” in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company’s joint venture in Madison is currently being liquidated and a plan is in place to sell assets
(including hydro power assets) at the mill site. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Madison sold its non-hydro power assets
at the mill site and we recognized a gain of $3.9 million related to the sale. We expect the sale of the hydro power
assets to be completed in early 2017. We believe the proceeds from the sale will be more than sufficient to cover
Madison’s obligations and therefore allow us to reverse our liability.
We received no distributions from Madison in 2016, 2015, or 2014.
