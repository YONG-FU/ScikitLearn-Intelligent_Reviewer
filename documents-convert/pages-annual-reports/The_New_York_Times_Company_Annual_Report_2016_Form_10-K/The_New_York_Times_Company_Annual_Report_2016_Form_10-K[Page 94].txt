We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against deferred tax assets based on the
consideration of both positive and negative evidence using a “more likely than not” standard. In making such
judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. We evaluated our deferred tax
assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers our three-year historical cumulative income /
(loss), including an assessment of the degree to which any such losses were due to items that are unusual in nature
(i.e., impairments of nondeductible goodwill and intangible assets).
As of December 27, 2015, we had a full valuation allowance on net operating losses of $36.2 million associated
with non-US. operations, as we determined those losses were not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. As of
December 25, 2016, following the streamlining of the Company's international print operations, those net operating
losses were no longer available for use and accordingly both the net operating losses and the associated full valuation
allowance have been removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Accrued income taxes were $1.9 million and $21.9 million as of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015,
respectively.
Income tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of equity awards reduced current taxes payable by $8.6
million in 2016, $4.4 million in 2015 and $3.1 million in 2014.
As of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, “Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes”
in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and for the years then ended in our Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Stockholders’ Equity was net of deferred tax assets of approximately $331 million and $353 million, respectively.
