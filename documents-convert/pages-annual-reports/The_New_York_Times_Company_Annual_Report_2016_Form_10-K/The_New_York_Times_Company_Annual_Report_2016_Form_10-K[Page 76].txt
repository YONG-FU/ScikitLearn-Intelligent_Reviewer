8. Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The transaction would be in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, based on assumptions that a market participant would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy consists of three levels:
Level 1—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability
to access at the measurement date;
Level 2—inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3—unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Assets/Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
As of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, we had assets related to our qualified pension plans measured
at fair value. The required disclosures regarding such assets are presented in Note 9.
The following table summarizes our financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015:

The deferred compensation liability, included in “Other liabilities—Other” in our Consolidated Balance Sheets,
consists of deferrals under The New York Times Company Deferred Executive Compensation Plan (the ”DEC”),
which enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. The
deferred amounts are invested at the executives’ option in various mutual funds. The fair value of deferred
compensation is based on the mutual fund investments elected by the executives and on quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets. Participation in the DEC was frozen effective December 31, 2015, and no new
contributions may be made into the plan.
