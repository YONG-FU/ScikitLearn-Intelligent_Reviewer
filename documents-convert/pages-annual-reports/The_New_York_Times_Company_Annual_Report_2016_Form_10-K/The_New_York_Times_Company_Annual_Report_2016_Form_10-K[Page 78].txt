As part of our strategy to reduce the size and volatility of our pension obligations, we have offered lump-sum
payments to certain former employees participating in both our qualified and non-qualified pension plans. In the
fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $21.3 million in connection with a lump-sum
payment offer made to certain former employees who participated in certain qualified pension plans. These lump-
sum payments totaled $49.5 million and were made with cash from the qualified pension plans, not with Company
cash. The effect of this lump-sum payment offer was to reduce our pension obligations by $52.2 million. In addition,
we recorded a $1.6 million curtailment related to the streamlining of the Company’s international print operations.
See Note 7 for more information on the streamlining of the Company’s international print operations.
In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $40.3 million in connection with a lump-
sum payment offer made to certain former employees who participated in certain qualified pension plans. These
lump-sum payments totaled $98.3 million and were made with cash from the qualified pension plans, not with
Company cash. The effect of this lump-sum payment offer was to reduce our pension obligations by $142.8 million.
In the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a pension settlement charge of $9.5 million in connection with a
lump-sum payment offer made to certain former employees who participated in certain non-qualified pension plans.
These lump-sum payments totaled $24.0 million and were paid out of Company cash. The effect of this lump-sum
payment offer was to reduce our pension obligations by $32.0 million.
