2015 Compared with 2014
In 2015, total advertising revenues decreased primarily due to lower print advertising revenues. Print
advertising revenues, which represented 69% of total advertising revenues in 2015, declined 8.0% to $441.6 million in
2015 compared with $480.1 million in 2014, mainly due to a decline in display advertising, primarily in the financial
services, entertainment and corporate categories. The decline was partially offset by an increase in the luxury goods,
real estate and technology categories.
Digital advertising revenues, which represented 31% of total advertising revenues in 2015, increased 8.2% to
$197.1 million in 2015 compared with $182.2 million in 2014 due to an increase in display advertising. Display
advertising benefited strongly from increased revenue from branded content as well as increased revenue from our
mobile and video platforms and our programmatic buying channels. These increases were partially offset by a decline
in traditional desktop display advertising.
Classified advertising revenues decreased 5.8% in 2015 compared with 2014 due to a decrease in the real estate
and help wanted categories.
Other advertising revenues increased 33.1% in 2015 compared with 2014 due to an increase in creative services
fees.
Other Revenues
Other revenues primarily consist of revenues from news services/ syndication, digital archives, rental income,
our NYT Live business, e-commerce and affiliate referrals. Rental income consists of revenue from the lease of ﬂoors
in our New York headquarters, which totaled $17.1 million, $16.9 million and $14.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
2016 Compared with 2015
Other revenues increased 6.0% in 2016 compared with 2015 largely due to affiliate referral revenue associated
with our acquisition in October 2016 of the product review and recommendation websites The Wirecutter and The
Sweethome, as well as from our NYT Live business.
2015 Compared with 2014
Other revenues increased 3.2% in 2015 compared with 2014 due to higher revenues from digital archives and
rental income.
