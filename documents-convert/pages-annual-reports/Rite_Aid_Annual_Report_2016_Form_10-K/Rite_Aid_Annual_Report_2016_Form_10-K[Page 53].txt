The second priority secured term loan facilities and the indentures that govern our secured and
guaranteed unsecured notes contain restrictions on the amount of additional secured and unsecured
debt that can be incurred by us. As of February 27, 2016, the amount of additional secured debt that
could be incurred under the most restrictive covenant of the second priority secured term loan facilities
and these indentures was approximately $1.8 billion (which amount does not include the ability to enter
into certain sale and leaseback transactions). However, we currently cannot incur any additional
secured debt assuming a fully drawn revolver and the outstanding letters of credit. The ability to issue
additional unsecured debt under these indentures is generally governed by an interest coverage ratio
test. As of February 27, 2016, we had the ability to issue additional unsecured debt under the second
lien credit facilities and other indentures.
