liabilities within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the
measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy consist of the following:
° Level 1—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
° Level 2—Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities
in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable for
the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument.
° Level 3—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based upon
management’s best estimate of inputs market participants could use in pricing the asset or
liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.
Long-lived non-financial assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for purposes of
calculating impairment using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy. The fair
value of long-lived assets using Level 2 inputs is determined by evaluating the current economic
conditions in the geographic area for similar use assets. The fair value of long-lived assets using Level 3
inputs is determined by estimating the amount and timing of net future cash ﬂows (which are
unobservable inputs) and discounting them using a risk-adjusted rate of interest (which is Level 1). The
Company estimates future cash ﬂows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which
the store is located. Significant increases or decreases in actual cash ﬂows may result in valuation
changes.
The table below sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the long-lived assets as of the
impairment measurement date for which an impairment assessment was performed and total losses as
of February 27, 2016 and February 28, 2015:
