loan facilities and, on an unsecured basis, the unsecured guaranteed notes, are full and unconditional

its subsidiaries. The Company has no independent assets or operations. Additionally, prior to the
Acquisition, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that did not guarantee the Amended and
Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, the credit facility, second priority secured term loan facilities
and applicable notes, were minor. Accordingly, condensed consolidating financial information for the
Company and subsidiaries is not presented for those periods. Subsequent to the Acquisition, other than
EIC, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that do not guarantee the credit facility, second priority

information for the Company, its guaranteeing subsidiaries and non—guaranteeing subsidiaries is
presented for those periods subsequent to the Acquisition. See Note 24 “Guarantor and
Non—Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Information” for additional disclosure.
