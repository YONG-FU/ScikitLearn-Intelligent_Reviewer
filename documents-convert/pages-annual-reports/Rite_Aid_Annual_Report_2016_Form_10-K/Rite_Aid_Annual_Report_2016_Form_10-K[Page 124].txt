15. Leases
The Company leases most of its retail stores and certain distribution facilities under noncancellable
operating and capital leases, most of which have initial lease terms ranging from 5 to 22 years. The
Company also leases certain of its equipment and other assets under noncancellable operating leases
with initial terms ranging from 3 to 10 years. In addition to minimum rental payments, certain store
leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursements for taxes,
maintenance and insurance. Most leases contain renewal options, certain of which involve rent
increases. Total rental expense, net of sublease income of $8,995, $8,559, and $8,369, was $973,347,
$964,484, and $952,777 in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. These amounts include contingent
rentals of $17,755, $18,919 and $18,679 in fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

leases were accounted for as operating leases and the remaining two were accounted for as capital
leases. The transactions resulted in a gain for certain stores of $670 which is deferred over the life of
the leases. In addition, the transaction resulted in a loss for certain stores of $546 which is included in
the loss on sale of assets, net for the fifty-two weeks ended February 27, 2016.
