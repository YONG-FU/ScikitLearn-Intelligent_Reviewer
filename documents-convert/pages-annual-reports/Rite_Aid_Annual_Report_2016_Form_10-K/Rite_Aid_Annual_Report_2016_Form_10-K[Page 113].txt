and $876, respectively. Additionally, any impact on the effective rate may be mitigated by the valuation
allowance that is remaining against the Company’s net deferred tax assets.
While it is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve
months, management does not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of
operations or the financial position of the Company.

Prior to the adoption of ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” the Company included interest as income tax
expense and penalties as an operating expense. The Company recognized an expense/(benefit) for
interest and penalties in connection with tax matters of $60, ($5,250) and ($16,833) for fiscal years
