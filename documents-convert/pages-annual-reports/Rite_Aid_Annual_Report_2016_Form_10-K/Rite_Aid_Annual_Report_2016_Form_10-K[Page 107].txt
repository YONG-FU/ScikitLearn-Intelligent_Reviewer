(1) These charges are related to stores that were impaired for the first time in prior periods. Most
active stores, requiring an impairment charge, are fully impaired in the first period that they do
not meet their asset recoverability test. However, we do often make capital additions to certain
stores to improve their operating results or to meet geographical competition, which if later are
deemed to be unrecoverable, will be impaired in future periods. Of this total, 351, 369 and 375
stores for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively have been fully impaired. Also included in
these charges are an insignificant number of stores, which were only partially impaired in prior
years based on our analysis that supported a reduced net book value greater than zero, but now
require additional charges.
(2) These charges are related to new stores (open at least 3 years) and relocated stores (relocated in
the last 2 years) and significant strategic remodels (remodeled in the last year) that did not meet
their recoverability test during the current period. These stores have not met their original return
on investment projections and have a historical loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash ﬂow
projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 3, 1 and 1 stores for fiscal
years 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively have been fully impaired.
(3) These charges are related to the remaining active stores that did not meet the recoverability test
during the current period. These stores have a historical loss of at least 2 years. Their future cash
ﬂow projections do not recover their current carrying value. Of this total, 27, 14 and 14 stores for
fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 respectively have been fully impaired.
The primary drivers of its impairment charges are each store’s current and historical operating
performance and the assumptions that the Company makes about each store’s operating performance
in future periods. Projected cash ﬂows are updated based on the next year’s operating budget which
includes the qualitative factors noted above. The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy
for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements. The categorization of assets and
