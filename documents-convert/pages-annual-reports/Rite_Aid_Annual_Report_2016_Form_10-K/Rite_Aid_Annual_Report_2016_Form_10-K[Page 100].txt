The above goodwill represents future economic benefits expected to be recognized from the
Company’s expansion into the pharmacy services market, as well as expected future synergies and
operating efficiencies from combining operations with EnvisionRx. Goodwill resulting from the
Acquisition of $1,637,351 has been allocated to the Pharmacy Services segment of which $1,360,156 is
deductible for tax purposes. At the time the financial statements were issued, initial accounting for the
business combination related to tax matters were preliminary and may be adjusted during the
measurement period. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company made measurement period
adjustments to reﬂect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date. These adjustments

$178,500 and offset by certain corresponding tax adjustments. As a result of the reduction of intangible
assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company recorded a reduction to its amortization
expense of $4,739, which adjusts the amortization expense to the amount that would have been
recorded in previous interim reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been
recognized as of the acquisition date.
During fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, acquisition costs of $27,402 and $15,442, respectively, were
expensed as incurred. The following unaudited pro forma combined financial data gives effect to the

financial data for all periods presented were adjusted to give effect to pro forma events that 1) are
