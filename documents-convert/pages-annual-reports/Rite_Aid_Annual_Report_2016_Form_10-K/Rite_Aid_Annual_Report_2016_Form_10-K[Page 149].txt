the obligations under the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Credit Facility, second priority
secured term loan facilities, secured guaranteed notes and unsecured guaranteed notes (the “Subsidiary
Guarantors”). Additionally, prior to the Acquisition, the subsidiaries, including joint ventures, that did
