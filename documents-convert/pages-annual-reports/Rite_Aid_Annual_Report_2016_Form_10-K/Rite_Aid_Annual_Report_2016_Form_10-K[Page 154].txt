Amount Value Amount Value
Variable rate indebtedness. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $3,027,675 $3,025,500 $2,642,008 $2,649,825

Cash, trade receivables and trade payables are carried at market value, which approximates their
fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. In addition, the Company has $6,069 of
investments, carried at amortized cost as these investments are being held to maturity, which are
included as a component of other assets as of February 27, 2016. The Company believes the carrying
value of these investments approximates their fair value.
The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating fair value disclosures for financial
instruments:
LIBOR-based borrowings under credit facilities:
The carrying amounts for LIBOR-based borrowings under the credit facilities, term loans and term
notes are estimated based on the quoted market price of the financial instruments.
Long-term indebtedness:
The fair values of long-term indebtedness are estimated based on the quoted market prices of the
financial instruments. If quoted market prices were not available, the Company estimated the fair value
based on the quoted market price of a financial instrument with similar characteristics.
