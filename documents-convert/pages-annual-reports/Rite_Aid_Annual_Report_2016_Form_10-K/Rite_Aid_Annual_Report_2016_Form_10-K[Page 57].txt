a reduction in our zero balance bank accounts.
Cash used in financing activities was $85.8 million in fiscal 2015, which reﬂects proceeds from the
issuance of our $1,152.3 million Tranche 7 Term Loan due 2020 (“Tranche 7 Term Loan”), net proceeds
from our revolver of $1,325 .0 million (which includes borrowings for the repayment and retirement of
our $1,143.7 million Tranche 7 Term Loan), the repayment of our $1,152.3 million Tranche 6 Term
Loan due 2020 and the redemption of $270.0 million of our 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2019.
We also made scheduled payments of $21.1 million on our capital lease obligations and $8.6 million on
our Tranche 7 Term Loan. Additionally, we paid an early redemption premium of $13.8 million in
connection with the redemption of our 10.25 % Senior Secured Notes due 2019 and deferred financing
costs of $1.5 million and $18.8 million in connection with our Tranche 7 Term Loan due 2020 and
January 2015 Senior Secured Credit Facility refinancing, respectively. Cash provided by financing
activities also reﬂects proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefit on stock
options and an increase in our zero balance bank accounts.

$45.6 million paid for early debt retirement and deferred financing costs of $17.9 million paid in

6.75% senior notes due 2021 and the corresponding retirement of $500.0 million of our 7.5% senior
