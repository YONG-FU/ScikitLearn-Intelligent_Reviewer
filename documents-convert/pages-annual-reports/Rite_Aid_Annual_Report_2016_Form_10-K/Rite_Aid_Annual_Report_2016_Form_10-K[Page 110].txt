The above results are not necessarily indicative of the impact that these closures will have on
revenues and operating results of the Company in the future, as the Company often transfers the
business of a closed store to another Company store, thereby retaining a portion of these revenues and
operating expenses.
6. Fair Value Measurements
The Company utilizes the three-level valuation hierarchy as described in Note 5, Lease Termination
and Impairment Charges, for the recognition and disclosure of fair value measurements.
As of February 27, 2016 and February 28, 2015, the Company did not have any financial assets
measured on a recurring basis. Please see Note 5 for fair value measurements of non-financial assets
measured on a non-recurring basis.
Other Financial Instruments
Financial instruments other than long-term indebtedness include cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable. These instruments are recorded at book value, which we
believe approximate their fair values due to their short term nature. In addition, the Company has
$6,069 of investments, carried at amortized cost as these investments are being held to maturity, which
are included as a component of other assets as of February 27, 2016. The Company believes the
carrying value of these investments approximates their fair value.
The fair value for LIBOR—based borrowings under the Company’s senior secured credit facility and
first and second lien term loans are estimated based on the quoted market price of the financial
instrument which is considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of substantially all of
the Company’s other long-term indebtedness are estimated based on quoted market prices of the
financial instruments which are considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount and
estimated fair value of the Company’s total long-term indebtedness was $6,914,483 and $7,235,916,
