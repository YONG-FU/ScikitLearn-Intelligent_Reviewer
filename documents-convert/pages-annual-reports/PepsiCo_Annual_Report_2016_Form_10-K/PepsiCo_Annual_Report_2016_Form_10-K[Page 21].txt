Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 1 0-K contains statements reﬂecting our views about our future performance
that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim, ” “anticipate, ” “believe, ”
“drive, ” “estimate, ” “expect, ” “expressed conﬁdence, ” “forecast, ” “future, ” “goal, ” “guidance, ”
“intend, ” “may, ” “objective, ” “outlook, ” “plan, ” “position, ” “potential, ” “project, ” “seek, ” “should, ”
“strategy, ” “target, ” “will ” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions.
All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and
developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information,
operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to dijfer materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in “Item IA. Risk Factors ” and
“Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Our
Business — Our Business Risks. ” Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-
looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any
forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion
of risks below and elsewhere in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we
believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance.
