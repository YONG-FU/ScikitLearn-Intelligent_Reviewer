2016
Total operating profit increased 17% and operating margin increased 2.3 percentage points. Operating profit
growth was driven by the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contributed
more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories throughout all of our segments,
effective net pricing and volume growth. Additionally, the impact of recording an impairment charge in the
prior year and ceasing the operations of our MQD joint venture contributed 1 percentage point to operating
profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and
marketing expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange and higher commodity costs, as well as the
deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points.
Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 13 percentage points to
operating profit growth and increased total operating profit margin by 1.5 percentage points, primarily
reﬂecting a 17—percentage-point contribution from the prior-year Venezuela impairment charges. Higher
commodity inﬂation reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point, primarily attributable to inﬂation
in the Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments, partially offset by deﬂation in the NAB, FLNA and
QFNA segments. The impact of our 53rd reporting week was fully offset by incremental investments we made
in our business. Corporate unallocated expenses decreased 1%, driven by lower pension expense reﬂecting
the change to the full yield curve approach, lower foreign exchange transaction losses and decreases in other
corporate expenses, partially offset by increased contributions to The PepsiCo Foundation, Inc. to fund
charitable and social programs and the net impact of items affecting comparability mentioned above included
in corporate unallocated expenses.
2015
Total operating profit decreased 13% and operating margin decreased 1.2 percentage points. Operating profit
performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, unfavorable foreign exchange, higher
commodity costs and increased advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by
effective net pricing, the benefit of actions associated with our productivity initiatives, which contributed
more than $1 billion in cost reductions across a number of expense categories throughout all of our segments,
and volume growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 9 percentage points and decreased total operating profit margin by 1.4
percentage points, primarily reﬂecting the Venezuela impairment charges. Higher commodity inﬂation
negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points, primarily attributable to inﬂation
