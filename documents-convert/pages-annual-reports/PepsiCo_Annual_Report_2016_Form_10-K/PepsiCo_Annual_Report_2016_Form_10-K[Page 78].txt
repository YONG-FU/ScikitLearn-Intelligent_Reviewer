indicative of our ongoing performance and reﬂects how management evaluates our operating results and
trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability.
We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful
information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when
evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.
