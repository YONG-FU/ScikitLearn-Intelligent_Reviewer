(including responding to changes in in-home and on—the-go consumption patterns); or the location of origin
or source of the ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to the production of
our products).
Consumer preferences have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors,
including: the aging of the general population; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition
profile of certain of our products, including the presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain
of our products; growing demand for organic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or
perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or substances present in certain
of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial ﬂavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame,
caffeine, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, trans fats or other
product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other
restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products, consumer concerns or perceptions
regarding packaging materials, such as with respect to the environmental sustainability or chemical makeup
thereof; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure
activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; negative publicity (whether
or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or
negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our
products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of social media posts or other
information disseminated by us or our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; perception of our employees, agents, customers,
suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or the business practices of such
parties; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these factors may reduce consumers”
willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could
result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position and could
adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Demand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality, product and marketing innovation and
production and distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products, improve
the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories, respond
to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new
products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients (including to
respond to applicable regulations); develop a broader portfolio of product choices and continue to increase
non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to traditional carbonated beverage offerings;
develop sweetener alternatives and innovation, improve the production, packaging and distribution of our
products ; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including
in the growing e-commerce channel ; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs,
including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media
and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs.
Although we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our
continued ability to develop, launch and maintain successful new products or variants of existing products
in a timely manner (including to correctly anticipate or effectively react to changes in consumer preferences)
or to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and
consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch
new products or variants of existing products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively
affecting consumer perception of our existing brands and may result in inventory write-offs and other costs
that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
