Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business
operations could adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations.
The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local
governmental agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United
States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display,
advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, disposal, recycling and use of our
products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices. In addition, in many
jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position
in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have
differing or conﬂicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emerging markets, may be less developed
or certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to varying
regulations and restrictions in jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or
sold. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations may change, sometimes dramatically
and unexpectedly, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such
changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and
marketing practices, laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or
export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs restricting the sale
and advertising of certain of our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are
marketed; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or
attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering
the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of
government funds or programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the United States,
to purchase certain of our products ; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product
claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or
attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer
protection laws, regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased
taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products, accounting rules and
interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products;
laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws
relating to the regulation of water treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating
to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements,
and competing regulations and standards, where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold,
may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely
affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The imposition by any jurisdiction in the United States or outside the United States of new laws, regulations
or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes,
labeling, product or production requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement
of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities
used in the production of our products, may continue to alter the environment in which we do business and,
therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or
proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow and the requirements or
restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, may also result in adverse publicity (whether or not
valid). For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a
specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or other measures that impact
the manufacture, sale or distribution of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased demand for our
