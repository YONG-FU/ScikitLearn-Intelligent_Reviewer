The amounts we report as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
0 Service cost is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.
0 Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
- Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to cam on plan investments for our
funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.
- Amortization of prior service (credit)/ cost represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit
changes resulting from plan amendments.
- Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the
amounts of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and
actual experience.
0 Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a
portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the
projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and
interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the
primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Curtailments are due to events such
as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits.
Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains
are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment
is adopted).
- Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to
actions such as restructuring.
