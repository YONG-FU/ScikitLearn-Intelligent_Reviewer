Mark-to-Market Net Impact
We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include
agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate
unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on
the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reﬂected in division results when the
divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize
the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which
remains in corporate unallocated expenses.
