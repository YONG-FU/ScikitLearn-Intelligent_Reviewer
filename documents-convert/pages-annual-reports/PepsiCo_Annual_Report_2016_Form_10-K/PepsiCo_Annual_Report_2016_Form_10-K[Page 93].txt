We use free cash ﬂow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share
repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash ﬂow to our shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will ensure appropriate
financial ﬂexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However,
see “Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade
or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain
factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash ﬂows.
Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment
grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our
future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially
acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair
our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same ﬂexibility that we have experienced
historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See
“Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or
potential downgrade of our credit ratings.” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to
our consolidated financial statements.

(a) Based on year-end foreign exchange rates. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably
predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements.
(b) Excludes $4,401 million related to current maturities of debt, $145 million related to the fair value adjustments for debt acquired in acquisitions
and interest rate swaps and payments of $ 142 million related to unamortized net discount.

Long-term contractual commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations, are generally not recorded
on our balance sheet. Operating leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing
commitments are primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelable
marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not
reﬂected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities
for pension and retiree medical plans are not reﬂected in our long-term contractual commitments. See Note
7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical
obligations.
Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest
entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.
