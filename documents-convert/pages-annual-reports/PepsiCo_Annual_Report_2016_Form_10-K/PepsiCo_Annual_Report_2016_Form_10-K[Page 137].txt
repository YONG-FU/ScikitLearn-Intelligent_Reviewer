Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its beverage business. As a result, we recorded a pre- and after-tax
impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in 2016 in the AMENA segment. This charge was
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in our income statement and reduced the value of
our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using
both an income and market approach, and is considered a non-recurring Level 3 measurement within the fair
value hierarchy. The carrying value of the investment in TAB was $166 million as of December 31, 2016.
We continue to monitor the impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our
investment in TAB.
In connection with our transaction with Tingyi in 2012, we received a call option to increase our holding in
TAB to 20% with an expiration date in 2015. Prior to its expiration, we concluded that the probability of
exercising the option was remote and, accordingly, we recorded a pre- and after-tax charge of $73 million
($0.05 per share) to write off the recorded value of this call option.
