Note 7 Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans
In 2016, the US. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an
unrelated insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for
certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer
of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-taX settlement charge of $242 million ($162 million after-
taX or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Effective as of the beginning of 2016, we prospectively changed the method we use to estimate the service
and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost. The pre-taX reduction in net periodic benefit cost
associated with this change in 2016 was $125 million ($81 million after-tax or $0.06 per share). See “Pension
and Retiree Medical Plans” in “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on this change in
account1ng est1mate.
In 2014, we offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in our US. defined benefit pension
plans the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s
pension benefit (payable in cash or rolled over into a qualified retirement plan or IRA). In 2014, we made a
discretionary contribution of $388 million to fund substantially all of these payments. We recorded a pre-
taX settlement charge of $141 million ($88 million after-tax or $0.06 per share) in 2014 as a result of this
transaction. See additional unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
