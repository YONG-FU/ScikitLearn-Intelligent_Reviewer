in the Latin America and ESSA segments, partially offset by deﬂation in the NAB, FLNA, AMENA and
QFNA segments. Additionally, impairment charges in the QFNA segment associated with our MQD joint
venture and the fourth quarter impact of our Venezuelan businesses (as a result of the deconsolidation) each
negatively impacted reported operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Corporate unallocated
expenses decreased 27%, primarily reﬂecting the impact of items affecting comparability mentioned above
included in corporate unallocated expenses and decreased pension expense, partially offset by increased
research and development costs and charges associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the
2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans.

2016
Net interest expense increased $321 million reﬂecting a charge of $233 million representing the premium
paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900%
senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $ 1 .5 billion and $750
million, respectively. This increase also reﬂects higher average debt balances, partially offset by higher
interest income due to higher average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments
used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation costs.
The reported tax rate decreased 0.7 percentage points due to the impact of the 2015 Venezuela impairment
charges, which had no corresponding tax benefit, partially offset by the 2015 favorable resolution with the
IRS of substantially all open matters related to the audits for taxable years 2010 and 2011, as well as the
2016 impairment charge recorded to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in TAB to its estimated
fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit.
