Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste,
price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity,
packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences
and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness. If we are unable to effectively promote
our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective
or if we are otherwise unable to compete effectively (including in distributing our products effectively and
cost efficiently through all existing and emerging channels of trade, including through e-commerce), we may
be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other
expenditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations could be adversely ajfected as a result of political
conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold
Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold may
be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For example, the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has created uncertainty
regarding how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure
and during the time leading up to its departure. In addition, many of the markets in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have recently held, or will hold in the near future, elections, the
results of which could create uncertainty regarding how existing laws and regulations may change, including
with respect to sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, the movement of goods, services and people
between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate ﬂuctuation, volatility in global stock
markets and global economic uncertainty. Any changes in, or the imposition of new, laws, regulations or
governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political conditions
could have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
Our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to
grow our business in developing and emerging markets.
Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including
Mexico, Russia, Brazil, the Middle East, China and India. However, there can be no assurance that our existing
products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will
be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global
competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. The following factors
could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and
emerging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions, acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil
unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related
impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local
economy in certain of these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or
to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings;
imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions ; imposition
of new or increased sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these
markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against US. multinational corporations operating in
these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers,
bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the
ingredients or substances used in our products, government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our
operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other
