[Beneﬁt liability $ (13,192) $ (13,033) $ (2,773) $ (511) $ (1,208) $ (1,300)]
Fair value of plan assets $ 11,458 $ 11,397 $ 2,492 $ 406 $ 320 $ 354
(a) The increase in US. pension plans in 2016 is due to the combination of two US. qualified defined benefit plans as part of our plan
reorganization, resulting in the accumulated benefit obligation of the combined plan exceeding the fair value of plan assets.
Of the total projected pension benefit liability at year-end 2016, $790 million relates to plans that we do not
fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.
Future Beneﬁt Payments and Funding
Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows:
f 2017*, 2018” 2019i, 2020i, 2021*, 2022—267
[Pension $ 725 $ 780 $ 825 $ 870 $ 925 $ 5,270 [
Retiree medical (a) $ 120 $ 120 $ 115 $ 110 $ 110 $ 485
(a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reﬂect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the
2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $2-$3 million for each of the years from 20 17 through 2021 and approximately
$7 million in total for 2022 through 2026.
These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans.
In 2017, we expect to make pension and retiree medical contributions of approximately $184 million, with
approximately $54 million for retiree medical benefits.
Plan Assets
Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed
periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and
cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical
plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit
obligations when they become due. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-
diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return
expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward
contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to
purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency
forwards.
