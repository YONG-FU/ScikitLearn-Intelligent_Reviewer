parts of the world and demand for water continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others
in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to water use.
Further, the popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed
and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about
us, our products, policies, practices or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; our use of social
media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers,
bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing,
or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether
or not valid) that could damage our reputation.
Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or
other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business,
financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.
Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations,
or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely aﬂect our business,
ﬁnancial condition or results of operations.
We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures,
divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential issues associated with these activities
could include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost
savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary
consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of management’s attention
from day-to-day operations.
With respect to acquisitions, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine
our businesses with the business of the acquired company, including integrating the acquired company’s
manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and
information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or
territories, motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees , conforming standards, controls
(including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance
and compliance with other regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation
structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative
infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses, consolidating sales and marketing operations;
retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; identifying and eliminating redundant and
underperforming operations and assets, coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax
costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and
other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation.
With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties
who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do. Joint ventures are
intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business
decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners may adversely affect the value of our
investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands
and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and
joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside
of the United States, including ﬂuctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United
States.
