Venezuela
Prior to the end of the third quarter of 20 l 5, the financial position and results of operations of our Venezuelan
snack and beverage businesses, which consist of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our beverage joint
venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela, were included in our consolidated financial statements and
reported under highly-inﬂationary accounting, with the functional currency of the US. dollar.
Conditions in Venezuela, including restrictive exchange control regulations and reduced access to U. S. dollars
through official currency exchange markets, have resulted in an other-than-temp orary lack of exchangeability
between the Venezuelan bolivar and the US. dollar. The exchange restrictions and other conditions have
significantly impacted our ability to effectively manage our businesses in Venezuela, including limiting our
ability to import certain raw materials and to settle U.S. dollar-denominated obligations, and have restricted
our ability to realize the earnings generated out of our Venezuelan businesses. We expect these conditions
will continue for the foreseeable future.
As a result of these factors, we concluded that, effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, we did
not meet the accounting criteria for control over our wholly-owned Venezuelan subsidiaries, and we no longer
had significant inﬂuence over our beverage joint venture with our franchise bottler in Venezuela. Therefore,
effective at the end of the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began
accounting for our investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and joint venture using the cost method of
accounting. We recorded pre— and after-tax charges of $1.4 billion in our income statement to reduce the
