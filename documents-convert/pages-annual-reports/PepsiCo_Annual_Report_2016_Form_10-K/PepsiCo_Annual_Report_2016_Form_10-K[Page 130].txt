For 2017 and 2016, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.5%. Our target investment
allocations for US. plan assets are as follows:
7 20177 7 20167
[Fixed income 7 40%, 7 40%|
US. equity 33% 33%
[International equity 22% 22%}
Real estate 5% 5%
Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market
conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.
The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term
rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our
historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inﬂation to assess the reasonableness
of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are
reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income
is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes
investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related
value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.
