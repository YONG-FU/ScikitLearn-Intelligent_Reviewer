In connection with our merger with The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker) in 2001, shares of our convertible
preferred stock were authorized and issued to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) fund established
by Quaker. The preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of convertible preferred stock are
set forth in Exhibit A to our amended and restated articles of incorporation. Quaker made the final award to
the ES OP in June 2001. The Company does not have any authorized, but unissued, “blank check preferred
stock.” PepsiCo repurchases shares of its convertible preferred stock from the ES OP in connection with share
redemptions by ESOP participants.
The following table summarizes our convertible preferred share repurchases during the fourth quarter of
20 16.
