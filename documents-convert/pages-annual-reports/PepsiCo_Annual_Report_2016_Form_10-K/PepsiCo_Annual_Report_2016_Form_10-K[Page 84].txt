2016
Net revenue grew 1%, driven by the 53rd reporting week which contributed 2 percentage points to the net
revenue growth, partially offset by unfavorable net pricing and mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Volume grew 2%, reﬂecting mid-single digit growth in Aunt Jemima syrup and mix and low-single-digit
growth in ready-to-eat cereals, oatmeal, and bars. The 5 3rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points
to the volume growth.
Operating profit increased 16%, impacted by prior year impairment charges related to our dairy joint venture
and ceasing its operations, which contributed 17 percentage points to operating profit growth. This increase
also reﬂects planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity
costs, which contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset
by higher advertising and marketing expenses, certain operating cost increases and the unfavorable net pricing
and mix. The 5 3rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth, partially offset
by incremental investments in our business, which reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.
2015
Net revenue declined 1% and volume grew slightly. The net revenue decline reﬂects unfavorable foreign
exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 2 percentage points, partially offset by
the volume growth. The volume growth reﬂects mid-single digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals and Aunt
Jemima syrup and mix, partially offset by a double-digit decline in MQD products and mid-single digit
declines in both grits and bars.
Operating profit decreased 10%, reﬂecting impairment charges, including a fourth quarter charge related to
ceasing operations of our dairy joint venture and the recognition of a gain associated with the divestiture of
a cereal business in 2014, which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 12 and 3 percentage
points, respectively. In addition, operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by certain
operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset
by planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, favorable mix and the volume growth, as
well as lower commodity costs, which positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit
performance.
