and cash ﬂows relating to customer contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are
the full retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the year
of adoption (cumulative effect approach). The guidance is effective in 2018, with early adoption permitted.
We are utilizing a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio by
reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result
from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance
obligations, principal versus agent and variable consideration. We continue to make significant progress on
our contract reviews and are also in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on changes to our business
processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance and, based on
the foregoing, we do not currently expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements.
We are continuing with our implementation plan and currently expect to adopt the new guidance beginning
in 2018 using the cumulative effect approach.

2014 Multi- Year Productivity Plan
The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, includes the next generation of
productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our food, snack and beverage businesses by:
accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing
footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities, re-engineering our go-to-market systems in
developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive
efficiency. The 2014 Productivity Plan is in addition to the 2012 Productivity Plan and is expected to continue
the benefits of that plan.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $160 million ($131 million after-tax or $0.09
per share), $169 million ($134 million after-tax or $0.09 per share) and $357 million ($262 million after-tax
or $0.17 per share), respectively, in conjunction with our 2014 Productivity Plan. All of these charges were
recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily relate to severance and other employee-
related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and other costs associated with the implementation of our
initiatives, including contract termination costs. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 3 1,
2016 is expected to be paid by the end of 2017.
