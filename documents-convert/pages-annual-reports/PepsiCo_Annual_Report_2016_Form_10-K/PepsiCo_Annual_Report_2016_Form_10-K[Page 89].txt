Beverage volume declined 2%, primarily reﬂecting a double-digit decline in Russia, partially offset by mid-
single-digit growth in Nigeria and low-single-digit growth in Turkey and the United Kingdom. Additionally,
Germany experienced a slight decline.
Operating profit decreased 22%, reﬂecting higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted operating
profit performance by 24 percentage points, primarily from transaction-related foreign exchange on purchases
of raw materials driven by a strong US. dollar. Additionally, operating profit performance was negatively
impacted by certain operating cost increases, the net volume declines and higher advertising and marketing
expenses, as well as the recognition of a 2014 gain associated with the sale of agricultural assets in Russia,
which negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. These impacts were partially
offset by the effective net pricing and planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories, as well
as lower charges in 2015 associated with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012
Productivity Plans, which positively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points. In
addition, the net impact of a 2014 impairment charge associated with a brand in Greece positively contributed
1 percentage point to operating profit performance. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation negatively
impacted operating profit performance by 22 percentage points.
