Investing Activities
During 2016, net cash used for investing activities was $7.1 billion, primarily reﬂecting net purchases of
debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $4.1 billion and net capital spending of $2.9
billion.
During 2015, net cash used for investing activities was $3 .6 billion, primarily reﬂecting net capital spending
of $2.7 billion, a reduction of cash of $568 million due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries
and net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $317 million.
See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division
and for further discussion of Venezuela. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion of our investments in debt securities.
We expect 2017 net capital spending to be approximately $3 billion, within our long-term capital spending
target of less than or equal to 5% of net revenue.
Financing Activities
During 20 16, net cash used for financing activities was $2. 9 billion, primarily reﬂecting the return of op erating
cash ﬂow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.2 billion and debt
redemptions of $2.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $4.7 billion, net proceeds
from short-term borrowings of $1.5 billion, and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion.
During 20 1 5, net cash used for financing activities was $3 .8 billion, primarily reﬂecting the return of op erating

We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and
share repurchase activity. On February 11, 2015, we announced a share repurchase program providing for
the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing from July 1, 2015 and expiring
on June 30, 20 1 8. In addition, on February 15, 20 17, we announced a 7.0% increase in our annualized dividend
to $3.22 per share from $3.01 per share, effective with the dividend that is expected to be paid in June 2017.
We expect to return a total of approximately $6.5 billion to shareholders in 2017 through share repurchases
of approximately $2.0 billion and dividends of approximately $4.5 billion.
