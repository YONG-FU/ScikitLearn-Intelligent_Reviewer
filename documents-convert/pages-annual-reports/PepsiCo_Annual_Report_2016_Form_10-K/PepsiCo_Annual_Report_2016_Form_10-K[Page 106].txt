Deferred advertising costs of $32 million and $40 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 26, 2015,
respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.
Distribution Costs

Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Software Costs
We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with
developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is
completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include
only (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software,
(ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects
and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs
are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis
when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years.
Software amortization totaled $214 million in 2016, $202 million in 2015 and $208 million in 2014. Net
capitalized software and development costs were $791 million and $863 million as of December 31, 2016
and December 26, 2015, respectively.

We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental

expenses.
