Reserves
A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited
and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our
major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:
Years Currently
Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Under Audit
[United States 2010, 2012—2015 I 20 12-2013 1
Mexico 2011-2015 2014
[United Kingdom 20 14-2015 None I
Canada (Domestic) 201 1-2015 201 1-2014
[Canada (International) 2009—20 1 5 2010—20 14 1
Russia 2012-2015 2013-2015
While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter,
we believe that our reserves reﬂect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these
reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any
particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction
to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution
of open tax issues, see “Other Consolidated Results” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
In 2015, we reached an agreement with the IRS resolving substantially all open matters related to the audits
of taxable years 2010 and 2011 (two immaterial matters were still open as of December 31, 2016). The
agreement resulted in a 2015 non-cash tax benefit totaling $230 million.
As of December 31, 2016, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities,
was $1,885 million. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes
and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount
of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $193 million as of December 31, 2016, of which $61
million of expense was recognized in 2016. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities,
was $144 million as of December 26, 2015, of which $14 million of expense was recognized in 2015.
