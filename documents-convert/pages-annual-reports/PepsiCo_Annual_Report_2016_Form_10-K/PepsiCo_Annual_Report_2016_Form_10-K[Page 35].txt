third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our
products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United
States; highly-inﬂationary economies, devaluation or ﬂuctuation, such as the devaluation of the Mexican
peso, Russian ruble, Egyptian pound and the Argentine peso, or demonetization of currency, such as the
withdrawal in India of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign
countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances
in foreign countries, from time to time, or could significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our
operations in certain of these markets and could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses, such as the
deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses effective as of the end of the third quarter of 20 l 5; the lack of
well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex
foreign and U. S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and
adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws
and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively
operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we
expect from our investments in these markets, our reputation, business, financial condition or results of
operations could be adversely affected.
Unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or
results of operations.
Many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold have experienced
and continue to experience unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns.
Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic conditions in the
United States and globally, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile
commodity markets, including speculative inﬂuences; highly-inﬂationary economies, devaluation,
ﬂuctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation
or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus
measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives, the effects of
any default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of the countries in which our products are made,
manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are
made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general
global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional,
local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable channels; or a decrease in
the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or
funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or
future economic conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, j oint venture
partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse
impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including US. and
non-U. S. commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be
exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable
economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyond our control. A ratings
downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or
changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter
into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to
extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing capacity
or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials; or may
result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities, which could have an adverse
