margins, we’re also investing in the future of our company, increasing advertising and
marketing as a percent of sales by 145 basis points over the past five years—40 basis
points over the past year alone. We’ve also increased our investment in research
and development (R&D) by 45% since 2011, spending approximately $3.5 billion
cumulatively on R&D over the past five years.
- Core constant currency earnings per share (EPS) grew 9% versus our initial goal of 6%.
This growth includes the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela in 2015, which caused
an approximately 2.5 percentage point drag on earnings. Excluding the impact of
deconsolidating Venezuela, core constant currency EPS grew 12%.
