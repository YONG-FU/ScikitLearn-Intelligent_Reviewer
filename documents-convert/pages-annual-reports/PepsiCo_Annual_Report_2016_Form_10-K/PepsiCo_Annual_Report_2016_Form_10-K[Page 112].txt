2012 Multi- Year Productivity Plan
The 2012 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 9, 2012, included actions in every aspect of
our business that we believe would strengthen our complementary food, snack and beverage businesses by:
leveraging new technologies and processes across PepsiCo’s operations, go-to-market and information
systems; heightening the focus on best practice sharing across the globe; consolidating manufacturing,
warehouse and sales facilities; and implementing simplified organization structures, with wider spans of
control and fewer layers of management. The 2012 Productivity Plan has enhanced PepsiCo’s cost-
competitiveness and provided a source of funding for future brand-building and innovation initiatives.
In 2015 and 2014, we incurred restructuring charges of $61 million ($50 million after-tax or $0.03 per share)
and $61 million ($54 million after-tax or $0.04 per share), respectively, in conjunction with our 2012
Productivity Plan. All of these charges were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and
primarily related to severance and other employee-related costs, asset impairments (all non-cash), and contract
termination costs. The 2012 Productivity Plan was completed in 2016 and all cash payments were paid by
the end of 2016.
