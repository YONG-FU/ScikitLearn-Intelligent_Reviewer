advertising and marketing expenses, as well as the recording of favorable settlements of promotional spending
accruals in 2014, which reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. Unfavorable foreign
exchange reduced operating profit growth by 1 percentage point. Items affecting comparability in the above

2016
Net revenue decreased 17%, reﬂecting the impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses,
effective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015, and unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively
impacted net revenue performance by 14 percentage points and 11 percentage points, respectively. These
impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing and net volume growth.
Snacks volume grew 3%, reﬂecting a mid-single-digit increase in Mexico. Additionally, Brazil experienced
a slight increase.
Beverage volume decreased 2%, reﬂecting a double-digit decline in Argentina and a low-single-digit decline
in Mexico and Honduras, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in Brazil and a mid-single-digit
increase in Guatemala.
Operating profit improvement primarily reﬂected the prior year Venezuela impairment charges, included in
items affecting comparability in the above table (see “Items Affecting Comparability”). This improvement
also reﬂects the effective net pricing, planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories and the
net volume growth. Additionally, the impact of prior-year charges associated with productivity initiatives
outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit
growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, as well as the deconsolidation
of our Venezuelan businesses, which reduced operating profit growth by 19 percentage points. Additionally,
higher commodity costs reduced operating profit growth by 22 percentage points, largely due to transaction-
related foreign exchange on purchases of raw materials, driven by a strong U.S. dollar. Operating profit was
also reduced by higher advertising and marketing expenses, as well as incremental investments in our business,
