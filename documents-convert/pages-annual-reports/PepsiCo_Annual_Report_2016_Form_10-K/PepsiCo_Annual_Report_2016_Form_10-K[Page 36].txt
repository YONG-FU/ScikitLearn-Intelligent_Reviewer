impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our
customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors and joint venture partners and could result in their inability to
obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting
in product delays, which could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition
or results of operations.
Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or
effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our
customers, suppliers, bottlers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise
disrupted
We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including
public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface
with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness
of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers ; to manage inventory; to manage our facilities ;
to conduct research and development; to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency; to comply with
regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential
information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the
employees of our independent bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint ventures, suppliers and
other third parties; and to communicate with our investors.
As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Cyberattacks and other cyber
incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated
and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored
institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide
range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal
data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political,
social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms
including cyber extortion, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through
phishing emails, or password theft. To date, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has to our knowledge had
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we do not allocate
and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology
infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and
training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers,
distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify
or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are
damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages,
acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications
failures, technology development defects, user errors, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or
disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business
could be disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing
inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract new, customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from
the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices,
plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the
unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs
to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual
property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets;
alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting
and other purposes, which could cause delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation; litigation;
regulatory enforcement actions or fines; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and re gulations; and
