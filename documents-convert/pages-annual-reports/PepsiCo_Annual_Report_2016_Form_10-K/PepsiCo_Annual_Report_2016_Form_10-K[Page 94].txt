We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including
sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers.
Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and
pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, these transactions are not reﬂected in our consolidated financial
statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment
by our bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote.
