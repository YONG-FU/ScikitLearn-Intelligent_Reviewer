These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability,
however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. A 1-percentage-point change in the
assumed health care trend rate would have the following effects:
1% 1%
7 Increase 7 7 Decrease 7
{2016 service and interest cost components 73; 3 7—73; (3)]|
2016 benefit liability 31; 39 3; (34)
Savings Plan
Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans, which are voluntary defined
contribution plans. The plans are designed to help employees accumulate additional savings for retirement,
and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on
years of service.
Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are
also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service
regardless of employee contribution.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total Company contributions were $164 million, $148 million and $130 million,
respectively.
