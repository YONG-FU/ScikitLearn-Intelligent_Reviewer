which reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation
reduced operating profit growth by 14 percentage points.
2015
Net revenue decreased 13%, primarily reﬂecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted
net revenue performance by 27 percentage points, including 1 1 percentage points from Venezuela. In addition,
the fourth quarter impact of the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan businesses negatively impacted net revenue
performance by 6 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing, including
14 percentage points of inﬂation-based pricing from Venezuela, and volume growth.
Snacks volume grew 1%, reﬂecting a low-single-digit increase in Mexico, partially offset by a high-single-
digit decrease in Brazil.
Beverage volume increased slightly, reﬂecting a low-single-digit increase in Mexico, partially offset by a
high-single-digit decrease in Brazil and a mid-single-digit decline in Argentina. The beverage volume growth
included a one-half-percentage point positive contribution from certain of our bottler’s brands related to our
joint venture in Chile.
Operating profit decreased 113%, primarily reﬂecting the Venezuela impairment charges, included in items
affecting comparability in the above table (see “Items Affecting Comparability”). This decrease also reﬂects
certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, as well as higher commodity costs, which
negatively impacted operating profit performance by 39 percentage points, including transaction-related
foreign exchange on purchases of raw materials driven by a strong U. S. dollar. Additionally, charges associated
with productivity initiatives outside the scope of the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net
pricing, planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories and the volume growth. Unfavorable
foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 37 percentage points, including a 23-
percentage-point impact from Venezuela. The results of our Venezuelan businesses negatively impacted
operating profit performance by 94 percentage points, primarily related to the impairment charges, and
included 4 percentage points from the fourth quarter impact of the deconsolidation. For additional information
