2016
Net revenue grew 5%, driven by volume growth and effective net pricing. The 5 3rd reporting week contributed
2 percentage points to the net revenue growth.
Volume grew 3%, reﬂecting high-single-digit growth in variety packs, and mid-single-digit growth in
trademark Doritos and Cheetos. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in our Sabra
joint venture products. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to the volume growth.
Operating profit grew 8%, primarily reﬂecting the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a
number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity costs, which contributed 3 percentage points to
operating profit growth, primarily fuel and cooking oil. These impacts were partially offset by certain
operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The
53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth, partially offset by incremental
investments in our business, which reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points.
2015
Net revenue grew 2% and volume grew 1%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and
the volume growth. The volume growth reﬂects mid-single-digit growth in variety packs and trademark
Tostitos, double-digit growth in trademark Smartfood and low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos.
These increases were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Lay’s.
Operating profit grew 6%, primarily reﬂecting the net revenue growth and planned cost reductions across a
number of expense categories, as well as lower commodity costs, which contributed 5 percentage points to
operating profit growth, primarily cooking oil and packaging. These impacts were partially offset by certain
operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, as well as higher advertising and marketing expenses.
