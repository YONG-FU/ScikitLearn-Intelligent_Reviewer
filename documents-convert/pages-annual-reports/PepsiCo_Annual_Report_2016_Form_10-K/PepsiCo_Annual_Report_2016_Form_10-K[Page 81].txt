(a) Excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following
divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between
BCS and CSE, as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our Company-owned and franchised—owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes
nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, is based on CSE.
(b) Includes the year-over—year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in
different package sizes and in different countries.
(c) For 2016 and 2015 reported growth, represents the impact of the exclusion of the 2015 and fourth quarter 2014 results of our Venezuelan
businesses, respectively, which were deconsolidated eﬁective as of the end of the third quarter of 2015.
((1) Our fiscal 2016 results include a 53rd reporting week which increased 2016 net revenue by $657 million, including $294 million in our
FLNA segment, $43 million in our QFNA segment, $300 million in our NAB segment and $20 million in our ESSA segment.
(6) Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
