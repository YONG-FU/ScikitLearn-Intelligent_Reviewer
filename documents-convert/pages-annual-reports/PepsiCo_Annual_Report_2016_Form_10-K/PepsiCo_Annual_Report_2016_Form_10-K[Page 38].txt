and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge
against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue,
margins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify
for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any
given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities.
Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality
and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption;
adverse effects on our operations; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional
investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption);
higher production costs; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our
suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damage
to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of
operations.
Our ability, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers,
joint venture partners, distributors and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products
in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the
following factors could impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our
portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disaster,
such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or ﬂooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties
or instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may
also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation
of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise;
health epidemics or pandemics; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems
associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured,
distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption
or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses,
distribution centers or other facilities; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;
telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes and other labor disputes; or other reasons
beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur,
could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional
resources to restore operations.
Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and
integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and
integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations
(whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration
or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause
production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation,
financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become
unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product
quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing
food safety requirements, we could decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we
may be subject to liability or government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause
