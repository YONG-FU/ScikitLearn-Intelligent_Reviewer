2016
Net revenue decreased 3%, primarily reﬂecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted
net revenue performance by 7 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by effective net pricing
and volume growth.
Snacks volume grew 3%, primarily reﬂecting mid-single-digit growth in South Africa and low-single-digit
growth in the Netherlands, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Russia. Additionally, the United
Kingdom, Turkey and Spain experienced low-single-digit growth.
Beverage volume grew 2%, primarily reﬂecting double-digit growth in Nigeria and high-single-digit growth
in the United Kingdom and Poland, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Russia and a low-single-
digit decline in Germany. Additionally, Turkey and France each experienced low-single-digit growth.
Operating profit increased 2.5%, reﬂecting planned cost reductions across a number of expense categories,
the effective net pricing and the volume growth. These impacts were partially offset by higher commodity
costs, which reduced operating profit growth by 19 percentage points, largely due to transaction-related
foreign exchange on purchases of raw materials led by a strong US. dollar. Additionally, certain operating
cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses reduced operating profit growth. The impact
of unfavorable foreign exchange translation and incremental investments in our business also reduced
operating profit growth by 6 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively.
