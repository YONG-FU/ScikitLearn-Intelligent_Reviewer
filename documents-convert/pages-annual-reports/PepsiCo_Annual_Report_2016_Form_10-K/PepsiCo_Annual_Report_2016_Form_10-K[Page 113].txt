0th er Productivity Initiatives
There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of
the 2014 and 2012 Productivity Plans in 2016. In 2015, we incurred charges of $90 million ($66 million
after-tax or $0.04 per share) related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives, including $48 million in
Latin America, $5 million in ESSA, $20 million in AMENA and $17 million in Corporate. In 2014, we
incurred charges of $67 million ($54 million after-tax or $0.04 per share) related to other productivity and
efficiency initiatives, including $11 million in Latin America, $26 million in ESSA and $30 million in
AMENA. Non-cash charges in 2015 and 2014 were $10 million and $13 million, respectively. These amounts
were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and primarily reﬂect severance and other
employee-related costs and asset impairments (all non-cash). These initiatives were not included in items
affecting comparability. Cash payments in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $43 million, $57 million and $3 million,
respectively. Substantially all of the accrual of $29 million at December 31, 2016 is expected to be paid by
the end of 2017.
We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives
discussed above.
