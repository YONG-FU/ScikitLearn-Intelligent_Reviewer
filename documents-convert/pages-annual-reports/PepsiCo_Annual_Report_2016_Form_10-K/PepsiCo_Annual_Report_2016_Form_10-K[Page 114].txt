Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized
on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in
progress is not depreciated until ready for service.

Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of
December 31, 2016 and using average 2016 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:
2017 2018 2019 2020 2021

Depreciable and amortizable assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the
operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash
ﬂows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted
future cash ﬂows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have
occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our policies for
amortizable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
