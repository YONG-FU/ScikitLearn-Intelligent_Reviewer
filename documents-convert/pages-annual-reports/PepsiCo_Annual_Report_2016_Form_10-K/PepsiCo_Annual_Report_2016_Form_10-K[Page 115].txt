Nonamortizable Intangible Assets
We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 31,
2016, December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014. We recognized no material impairment charges
for nonamortizable intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, December 26,
2015 and December 27, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived
reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However, there
could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB ’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future
revenues and their contribution to the operating results of NAB’s CSD business do not achieve our expected
future cash ﬂows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of
capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in
Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these countries and
have concluded that there is no impairment as of December 31, 2016. However, there could be an impairment
of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries if there is a further deterioration in these conditions,
if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash
ﬂows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used
to estimate fair value. For additional information on our policies for nonamortizable intangible assets, see
Note 2.
