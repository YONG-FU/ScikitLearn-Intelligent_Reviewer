NII HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATENIENTS
Brazil Spectrum Financing. In December 2015, Nextel Brazil participated in a spectrum auction and was the successful bidder for 30 MHz of spectrum
in the 1.8 GHz band for 455 million Brazilian reais, or approximately $116.7 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time. The spectrum
license has an initial term of 15 years with an optional 15 -year renewal period. In July 2016, Nextel Brazil paid 45.5 million Brazilian reais, or approximately
$14.0 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time, in connection with the signing of this license agreement. The remaining 409.5 million
Brazilian reais, or approximately $122.2 million based on current foreign currency exchange rates, plus accrued interest of 1% per month and annual
inﬂationary adjustments, is due in six annual installments, beginning in July 2019. Nextel Brazil elected to accept the govemment-provided spectrum
ﬁnancing for the remaining amount due under this spectrum ﬁnancing.
Capital Leases and Tower Financing Obligations.
2013 Tower Transactions. In December 2013, Nextel Brazil sold 1,940 communication towers for proceeds based on foreign currency exchange rates at
the time of $348.0 million, subject to purchase price adjustments and guaranteed by NIIT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NH Holdings. Nextel Brazil
also sold 103 towers for proceeds of $18.6 million in June 2014, subject to purchase price adjustments and guaranteed by NIIT. In October 2014, upon the
ﬁnalization of the purchase price adjustments, Nextel Brazil completed the sale of all of these towers and began accounting for this transaction as a sale-
leaseback. As a result, Nextel Brazil recognized an immaterial loss on the sale of the towers as a component of operating income in the fourth quarter of 20 14.
Site-Related Capital Lease Obligations. We have entered into various agreements under which we are entitled to lease space on towers or other
structures owned by third parties and to install our transmitter and receiver equipment in that space.
Tower Financing Obligations. From 2002 to 2008, we sold and subsequently leased back space on certain transmitter and receiver sites in Brazil. Due
to our continuing involvement with these properties, we account for these transactions as ﬁnancing arrangements. As a result, we did not recognize any gains
from the sales of these towers under these arrangements, and we maintain the tower assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we recognized the
proceeds received as ﬁnancing obligations. We recognize ground rent payments as operating expenses in cost of service and tower base rent payments as
interest expense and a reduction in the ﬁnancing obligation using the effective interest method. In addition, we recognize co-location rent payments made by
the third party lessees to the owner of the site as other operating revenues because of our continuing involvement with the tower assets. During the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, we recognized $7.7 million and $19.8 million, respectively, in other operating revenues related to these co—location
lease arrangements. During the six months ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $3.6 million and $7.8 million
in other operating revenues, respectively, related to these arrangements.
Debt M aturities.
Because it is unlikely that we will be able to satisfy one of the applicable ﬁnancial covenants in Nextel Brazil's local bank loans as of the next
measurement date at December 31, 2017, and as a result of certain events of default related to Nextel Brazil's equipment ﬁnancing facility, we classiﬁed the
principal amounts outstanding under these facilities as due in 2017 for purposes of the table below. For the years subsequent to December 31, 2016,
scheduled annual maturities of all debt outstanding are as follows (in thousands):
