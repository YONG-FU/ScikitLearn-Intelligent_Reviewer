B. Results of Operations
For purposes of comparison to the year ended December 31, 2016, we combined the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2015
with the results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015. However, as a result of the application of fresh start accounting and other events related
to our reorganization under Chapter 11, the Successor Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended December 31, 2015 are prepared under a new
basis of accounting and are not directly comparable to the Predecessor Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the same
reasons, our results of operations for the combined twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 are not fully comparable to our results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2016 or 2014.
In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US, we translated the results of operations of our Brazilian operating segment
using the average exchange rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 and for the combined twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 . The
following table presents the average exchange rates we used to translate Nextel Brazil's results of operations, as well as changes from the average exchange
rates utilized in prior periods.

The following table presents the currency exchange rates in effect at the end of 2014, as well as the end of each of the quarters in 2015 and 2016. Ifthe
values of these exchange rates depreciate further relative to the US. dollar, our future operating results and the values of our assets held in local currencies
will be adversely affected.

To provide better insight into Nextel Brazil's results, we present the year-over—year percentage change in each of the line items presented on a
consolidated basis and for Nextel Brazil on a constant currency basis in the "Constant Currency Change from Previous Year" columns in the tables below.
The comparison of results for these line items on a constant currency basis shows the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates (i) by adjusting
the relevant measures for the combined twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 to amounts that would have resulted if the average foreign currency
exchange rates for the combined twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 were the same as the average foreign currency exchange rates that were in
effect for the year ended December 31, 2016; and (ii) by comparing the constant currency ﬁnancial measures for the combined twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2015 to the actual ﬁnancial measures for the year ended December 31, 2016. This constant currency comparison applies consistent exchange
rates to the operating revenues earned in foreign currencies and to the other components of segment earnings for the combined twelve-month period ended
December 31, 2015. The constant currency information reﬂected in the tables below is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in
the US. and should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information contained in our results of operations.
