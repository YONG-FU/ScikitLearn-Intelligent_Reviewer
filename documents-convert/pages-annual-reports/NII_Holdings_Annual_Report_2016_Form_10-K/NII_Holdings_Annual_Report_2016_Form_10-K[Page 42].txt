- a $42.8 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to our decision to cease further development on one of the strategic options for the next
generation of our push—to-talk services;
° $27.7 million in severance and related costs incurred at the corporate level and in Brazil from the separation of employees in an eﬁ‘ort to streamline
our organizational structure and reduce general and administrative expenses; and
0 $21.9 million in other non-cash asset impairment charges, the majority of which related to the shutdown or abandonment of certain transmitter and

2. Depreciation and amortization
The $154.8 million, or 39%, decrease in consolidated depreciation and amortization on a reported basis, and the 15% decrease on a constant currency
basis, for the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was principally the result of a decrease in the value of Nextel Brazil's property,
plant and equipment resulting from the implementation of fresh start accounting. See Note 3 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for more information.
3. Interest expense, net
Consolidated net interest expense decreased $234.5 million, or 63%, on a reported basis, and 59% on a constant currency basis, for the combined period
ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of the suspension of interest on all series of our senior notes in connection with our Chapter
11 ﬁling and subsequent cancellation of these notes in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11. See Note 3 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for more information.
4. Reorganization items
Reorganization items of $1,958.3 million in 2015 were primarily related to the $1,775.8 million gain we recognized in connection with the settlement
of our liabilities subject to compromise upon our emergence from Chapter 11 and a $261.8 million gain as a result of the implementation of fresh start
accounting, partially offset by professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with our Chapter 11 ﬁling.
Reorganization items of $7 1 .6 million in 2014 were related to the write-off of discounts, premiums and unamortized ﬁnancing costs associated with our
NII Capital Corp. and NIIT senior notes, as well as professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with our Chapter 11 ﬁling.
5. Income tax beneﬁt (provision)
The $8.0 million, or 160%, change in the consolidated income tax provision from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31, 2015 is primarily
due to the reversal of a liability for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations in Brazil and the reduction of the valuation
allowance.
