NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATENIENTS
Stock Option Awards
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2015, the six months ended June 30, 2015 and the year ended December
31,2014, we recognized $2.8 million, $1.0 million, $1.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in share-based compensation expense related to stock
options. The amounts recognized in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income for tax beneﬁts related to share-based payment arrangements
in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were not material. We include substantially all share-based compensation expense as a component of selling, general and
administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2016, there was $4.1 million in unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested employee stock option
awards. We expect this cost to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.72 years. The amount of cash paid for exercises under all share-based
payment arrangements was immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2015, the six months ended June 30, 2015
and the year ended December 31, 2014.
As a result of the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings, all prior stock option awards granted under the 2012 Incentive Compensation
Plan were canceled. Our stock options generally vest thirty-three percent per year over a three-year period. The following table summarizes stock option
activity under the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan:

There were no options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our vested stock options had an intrinsic value of
zero. Generally, our stock options are non—transferable, except by will or laws of descent or distribution, and the actual value of the stock options that a
recipient may realize, if any, will depend on the excess of the market price on the date of exercise over the exercise price. If a participant's employment is
terminated without cause prior to the date options are available to be exercised, the participant shall receive stock options on a pro-rata basis based on the
fraction of the performance period that has elapsed from the beginning of the performance period until the participant's termination. If the participant does
not exercise the pro-rata shares within 90 days of the employee's termination, the options are considered forfeited and are available for reissuance under the
terms of the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan.
The weighted average fair value of the stock option awards on their grant dates using the Black-Scholes—Merton option-pricing model was $1.48 for
each option granted during the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.98 for the period from June 26, 2015 to December 31, 2015, based on the following
assumptions:
Successor Company
Year Ended Period from June 26, 2015
December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015
[Risk free interest rate 1.53% — 1.90% 1.71% — 2.05% 1

The expected term of stock option awards granted represents the period that we expect our stock option awards will be outstanding and was determined
based on a Monte Carlo model of stock prices and option disposition intensity. The intensity is based on models of stock price path, time dependent
suboptimal voluntary exercise and post-vest termination. The risk free interest rate for the grant date of options granted is consistent with the zero—coupon
US. Treasury rate curve. Expected volatility takes into consideration a blended historical and implied volatility of comparable companies' option contracts.
