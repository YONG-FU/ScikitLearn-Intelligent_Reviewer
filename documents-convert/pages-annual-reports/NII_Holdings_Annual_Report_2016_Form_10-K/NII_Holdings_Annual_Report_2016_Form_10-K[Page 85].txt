our debt to their fair values as of June 30, 2015. As a result, the carrying values of our bank loans do not represent the outstanding principal balances. See
Note 3 for more information. The components of our debt are as follows:

Brazil Equipment Financing Facility. In April 2012, Nextel Brazil entered into a US. dollar-denominated loan agreement with the China Development
Bank, under which Nextel Brazil was able to borrow up to $500.0 million to ﬁnance infrastructure equipment and certain other costs related to the
deployment of its WCDMA network. A portion of this ﬁnancing has a ﬂoating interest rate based on LIBOR plus 2.90% (4.22% and 3.75% as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively), and the remainder has a ﬂoating interest rate based on LIBOR plus 1.80% (3.12% and 2.65% as of December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively). This ﬁnancing is guaranteed by NII Holdings. In addition, the terms of this ﬁnancing may limit Nextel Brazil's ability to pay
dividends and other upstream payments. Loans under this agreement have a three-year borrowing period, a seven-year repayment term that began in August
2015 and a ﬁnal maturity of June 2022. Assets purchased using the amounts borrowed under Nextel Brazil's equipment ﬁnancing facility are pledged as
collateral.
In December 2014, Nextel Brazil and the lender under the equipment ﬁnancing facility agreed to amend this facility to remove all ﬁnancial covenants
beginning with the December 31, 2014 measurement date through the June 30, 2017 measurement date so that the ﬁrst measurement date under the amended
facility will be December 31, 2017. In exchange for that covenant relief, Nextel Brazil granted the lender preferential rights to the amounts held in certain
bank accounts. Based on our current outlook,
