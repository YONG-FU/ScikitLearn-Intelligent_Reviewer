The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of ﬁJture taxable income sufﬁcient to realize our tax loss carryforwards and other
tax deductions. Valuation allowances are required to be recognized on deferred tax assets unless it is determined that it is “more-likely-than-not” that the
asset will be realized. As of December 31, 2016, we continued to record full valuation allowances on the deferred tax assets of our foreign operating
companies, our US. parent company and subsidiaries and our foreign holding companies due to substantial negative evidence, including the recent history
of cumulative losses and the projected losses for 2017 and subsequent years.
We are subject to income taxes in both the US. and the non-US. jurisdictions in which we operate and to potential examination by the relevant tax
authorities. The earliest years that remain subject to examination by jurisdiction are: US. - 2007; Brazil - 2011, and Luxembourg, Netherlands and Spain -
2009. We regularly assess the potential outcome of ﬁlture examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of our provision
for income taxes. We have only recorded ﬁnancial statement beneﬁts for tax positions which we believe reﬂect the “more-likely-than-not” criteria
incorporated in the FASB’s authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, and we have established income tax accruals in accordance
with this authoritative guidance where necessary. Once a ﬁnancial statement beneﬁt for a tax position is recorded or a tax accrual is established, we adjust it
only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change. While we believe that the amounts of the recorded ﬁnancial
statement beneﬁts and tax accruals reﬂect the more-likely-than—not criteria, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or ﬁlture examinations may
result in a reduction to the tax beneﬁts previously recorded on the ﬁnancial statements or may exceed the current income tax reserves in amounts that could
be material.
As of December 31, 2016, our unrecognized tax beneﬁts are not material, and there are no unrecognized tax beneﬁts that could potentially affect our
ﬁlture effective tax rate.
12. Employee Stock and Beneﬁt Plans
In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, NH Holdings canceled all shares of its common stock, preferred stock and other equity interests that
existed prior to June 26, 2015. Our Board of Directors subsequently adopted an incentive compensation plan, which we refer to as the 2015 Incentive
Compensation Plan. The 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan provides us with the ability to award stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and
cash—based incentives to our employees, directors and officers. The 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan contemplates grants of up to 5,263,158 shares of our
common stock to directors and employees of the reorganized company, including potential grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and options to
purchase shares of our common stock. All grants or awards made under the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan are governed by written agreements between
us and the participants and have a maximum term often years.
On the date of our emergence from Chapter 11, we made grants of 564,3 1 1 shares of restricted stock, 41,721 restricted stock units and 1,580,208 options
to purchase shares of common stock. Subsequent to this date, we made grants of an additional 468,069 shares of restricted stock and 2,821,457 options to
purchase shares of common stock. Stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are also granted to certain new employees on the later of
the date of hire or the date that the grant is approved. In addition, under the provisions outlined in the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, our chief
executive ofﬁcer may grant, under authority delegated to him by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, a limited number of stock options
(not to exceed 40,000 shares in the aggregate for the plan year) and restricted stock/restricted stock unit awards (not to exceed 20,000 shares in aggregate for
the plan year) to employees who are not executive ofﬁcers.
