8. Fair Value Measurements
Nextel Argentina.
On September 11, 2015, two of our indirect subsidiaries entered into a binding agreement with Grupo Clarin relating to the sale of all of the outstanding
equity interests of Nextel Argentina. In connection with the initial agreement, we issued a non-recourse promissory note in the amount of $85.0 million and
pledged the remaining 51% of the equity interests in Nextel Argentina to Grupo Clarin. We recorded our retained 51% interest in Nextel Argentina as an
equity method investment under the fair value option, which is included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December
31, 2015, we estimated the fair value of this investment to be $108.1 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we recorded the non-recourse promissory
note as a component of other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at its estimated fair value of $108.1 million. This fair value estimate was
based on the $178.0 million purchase price paid by Grupo Clarin, as adjusted for changes in excess cash from September 11, 2015 through December 31,
2015. On January 27, 2016, the agreement was amended to permit Grupo Clarin or any of its afﬁliates to exercise the right to acquire the remaining 51%
equity interest prior to receiving regulatory approval, and Grupo Clarin and its afﬁliate immediately acquired the remaining 51% of Nextel Argentina for no
additional proceeds. In connection with the completion of this transaction, the promissory note was canceled on January 27, 2016.
Available-for-Sale Securities.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, available-for—sale securities held by Nextel Brazil included $73.8 million and $56.2 million, respectively, in
investment funds. As of December 31, 2015, available-for—sale securities held by Brazil also included $9.3 million in certiﬁcates of deposit with a Brazilian
bank. These funds invest primarily in Brazilian government bonds, long-term, low-risk bank certiﬁcates of deposit and Brazilian corporate debentures.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2015, as well as during the year
ended December 31, 2014, we did not have any material unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments.
We account for our available-for—sale securities at fair value. The fair value of our Brazilian certiﬁcates of deposit is based on their current redemption
amount and we classify these certiﬁcates of deposit within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of Nextel Brazil's investment ﬁmds is measured
based on the funds' net asset value as a practical expedient, which is excluded from the fair value hierarchy.
Held-t0 -Maturity Investments.
We periodically invest some of our cash holdings in certain securities that we intend to hold to maturity. As of December 31, 2015, held-to-maturity
investments included $18.1 million in short-term investments at NIIT in US. treasury notes. We account for held—to-maturity securities at amortized cost,
which approximates the fair value observed in the market. These securities matured in February 2016. As of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our held-to-
maturity investments was $18.0 million.
