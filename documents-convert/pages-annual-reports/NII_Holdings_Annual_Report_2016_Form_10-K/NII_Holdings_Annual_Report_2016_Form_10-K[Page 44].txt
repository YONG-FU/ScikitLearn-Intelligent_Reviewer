utilized their existing handsets compared to 34% of new WCDMA subscribers utilizing their existing handsets during 2014. This decrease in handset and
accessory net subsidy was partially offset by a $25.3 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2015 related to certain tax credits that we did not
believe were probable of being recovered. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's handset and accessory net subsidy decreased 67% for the combined
period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
3. Cost of service
The $224.0 million, or 32%, decrease in cost of service on a reported basis for the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 is
primarily caused by the impact of weaker foreign currency exchange rates described above. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's cost of service
decreased 4% from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31, 2015 primarily as the result of a decrease in interconnect costs related to the changes in
the regulated interconnect cost structure described above. In addition, on a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil recognized signiﬁcant cost savings in the
combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of insourcing certain engineering ﬁinctions that were previously performed by third
party service providers. Also, with the continuing decline in the number of iDEN subscribers in Nextel Brazil's subscriber base, Nextel Brazil's service and
repair costs related to its iDEN handset maintenance program continued to decrease. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs related to
our nationwide roaming arrangement, as well as an increase in direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs on a local currency basis resulting from an
8% increase in the number of sites in service from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015.
4. Selling and marketing expenses
The $90.7 million, or 34%, decrease in selling and marketing expenses on a reported basis during the combined period ended December 31, 2015
compared to 2014 is largely due to the impact of weaker foreign currency exchange rates described above. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's
selling and marketing expenses decreased 6% in the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of a reduction in sales and
marketing personnel and reduced advertising and media expenses.
5. General and administrative expenses
The $116.8 million, or 19%, decrease in general and administrative expenses on a reported basis for the combined period ended December 31, 2015
compared to 2014 is primarily due to the impact of weaker foreign currency exchange rates described above. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's
general and administrative expenses increased 14% over the same period primarily as a result of an increase in bad debt expense caused by a signiﬁcant
decrease in collections related to deteriorating economic conditions in Brazil and higher costs related to civil contingencies initiated by customers. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in payroll and related expenses on a local currency basis resulting from workforce reductions, as well as lower
customer care expenses on a local currency basis resulting from the outsourcing of Nextel Brazil's customer care ﬁlnction and a reduction in the volume of
customer care calls received.

Segment losses decreased $63.3 million, or 49%, in the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to reduced payroll
costs resulting from fewer general and administrative personnel following reductions in force that we implemented in 2014 and 2015, lower consulting
expenses, lower information technology costs and $22.6 million in professional fees incurred in 2014 in connection with the preparation of our Chapter 11
ﬁling.
