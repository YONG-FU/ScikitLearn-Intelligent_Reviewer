We compete with large, well—capitalized competitors in Brazil that have substantial ﬁnancial and other resources. Nextel Brazil's largest competitors are
Vivo, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica and has the largest market share in the S50 Paulo metropolitan area and Rio de Janeiro; Claro, which is controlled
by Mexico's America Movil; Telecom Italia Mobile, or TIM, a subsidiary of Italy's Telecom Italia; and TNL PCS SA, a subsidiary of Telemar Norte Leste,
Brazil's largest wireline incumbent, that offers its services under the brand name "Oi."
Many of our competitors have a larger spectrum position than ours, including more spectrum that can be used to support a wide range of wireless
technologies, and have greater coverage areas and/or name recognition than we do, making it easier for them to expand into new markets and offer new
products and services. Our competitors typically have more extensive distribution channels than ours or are able to use their scale advantages to acquire
subscribers at a lower cost than we can, and most of them have implemented network technology upgrades, including both WCDMA and LTE, that support
high speed data services. Some of these competitors also have the ability to offer bundled telecommunications services that include local, long distance,
subscription television and data services, and can offer a larger variety of handsets and other devices with a wide range of prices, brands and features. In
addition, the ﬁnancial strength and operating scale of some of these competitors allows them to offer aggressive pricing plans, including those targeted at
attracting our existing subscribers.
In recent years, our largest competitors have increasingly focused their marketing efforts on attracting postpaid subscribers within our target segments
by, among other things, enhancing their network quality and their customer care ﬁlnctions, which may minimize the value of our network quality and speed
(for our WCDMA network) and the quality of our customer service as points of differentiation. In addition, as we have pursued our plans to extend our target
market to include more high-value consumers, we are increasingly competing more directly for subscribers that are also targeted by our largest competitors.
We compete with other communications service providers based primarily on our simple and attractive pricing plans, high quality customer experience
and differentiated wireless service offerings. We are continuing to pursue our target market with an expanded message that focuses on our transition to a full
service wireless operator capable of providing high quality and high speed data services supported by our WCDMAnetwork. Since our legacy iDEN network
does not support high speed data applications, we are experiencing higher levels of migrations to lower price rate plans both within our iDEN network and
from our iDEN network to our WCDMA network.
We believe that the users who primarily make up our targeted subscriber base are likely to base their purchase decisions on network quality and quality
of customer support, as well as on the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to communicate quickly, efﬁciently and
economically. However, because pricing is one of a number of important factors in potential customers' purchasing decisions, and in light of the economic
conditions discussed above, increased price competition in the customer segments we target could require us to decrease prices or increase service and
product offerings, which would lower our revenues, increase our costs or both.
In response to recent trends in Brazil's competitive environment, as well as the current economic climate, we have been taking the following actions:
- increasing our focus on high value customer segments in order to generate higher levels of ARPU;
- launching a new ﬁilly digital distribution channel that enables subscribers to purchase, activate and customize their plans through an online
application;
- ﬁlrthering cost reduction strategies in order to continue to lower cash costs per user and improve overall proﬁtability;
° continuing to streamline distribution channels, including closing unproﬁtable retail stores;
- continuing to migrate subscribers from our legacy iDEN network to our WCDMA network;
- reviewing commission and subsidy strategies;
0 eliminating non-critical capital expenditures;
- ﬁlrther utilizing sales strategies that incentivize subscribers to use their existing handsets when purchasing our services to keep subscriber
acquisition costs at manageable levels;
- harvesting the proﬁtability of our legacy iDEN network;
- streamlining our headquarters operations; and
° continuing to pursue initiatives to maintain and enhance our existing liquidity.
