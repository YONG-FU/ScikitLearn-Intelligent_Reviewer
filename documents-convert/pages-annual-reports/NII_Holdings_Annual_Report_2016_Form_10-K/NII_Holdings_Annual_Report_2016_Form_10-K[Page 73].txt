NII HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATENIENTS
In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, we were required to apply the provisions of fresh start accounting to our ﬁnancial statements
because: (i) the holders of existing voting shares of N11 Holdings prior to its emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings received less than 50% of the voting
shares of N11 Holdings outstanding following its emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings; and (ii) the reorganization value of our assets immediately
prior to conﬁrmation of the Plan of Reorganization was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims. Because our results of operations during the
period from June 26, 2015 to June 30, 2015 were not material, we applied fresh start accounting to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of the close of
business on June 30, 2015. Under the principles of fresh start accounting, a new reporting entity is considered to be created, and as a result, we allocated the
reorganization value of N11 Holdings as of June 30, 2015 to our individual assets based on their estimated fair values at the date we applied fresh start
accounting.
The total value of the cash and shares of common stock distributed under the Plan of Reorganization was $2.813 billion. We refer to this value as the
Plan Distributable Value. The Plan Distributable Value was comprised of $745.2 million of cash paid to the holders of our NIIT and N11 Capital Corp. senior
notes and $2,067.7 million of new common stock. We also distributed an additional $2.8 million to other creditors. We determined the equity value of the
Successor Company to be approximately $2,067.7 million, which represents the $2.813 billion Plan Distributable Value less $745.2 million in cash
distributions.
The following condensed consolidated balance sheet reconciles the balance sheet of the Predecessor Company immediately prior to our emergence
from Chapter 11 to the balance sheet of the Successor Company immediately subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11. The adjustments set forth in the
condensed consolidated balance sheet presented below reﬂect the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization, which are reﬂected in the "Reorganization
Adjustments" column, and the fair value adjustments required by the implementation of fresh start accounting, which are reﬂected in the "Fresh Start
Adjustments" column. The information presented below reﬂects changes in the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities that occurred in the
second half of 2015 as we ﬁnalized fresh start accounting. This condensed consolidated balance sheet should be read in conjunction with the explanatory
notes following the table.
