Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
NII Holdings, Inc.:
We consent to the incorporation by reference in the registration statements (No. 333-205259 and 333-205665) on Forms S-8 and S-3, respectively, of N11
Holdings, Inc. (the Company) of our reports dated March 9, 2017 with respect to the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015
(Successor), and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash ﬂows for the year ended
December 31, 2016 (Successor), for the six month periods ended December 31, 2015 (Successor) and June 30, 2015 (Predecessor) and for the year ended
December 31, 2014 (Predecessor), and all related ﬁnancial statement schedules, and the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of
December 31, 2016, which reports appear in the December 31, 2016 annual report on Form 10-K of the Company.
Our report dated March 9, 2017, on the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2016, expresses our opinion that the
Company did not maintain effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2016 because of the effect of a material weakness on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria. A material weakness related to an ineffective tone at the top at Nextel Brazil which could result in
management override of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and an ineffective information and communication process related to the identiﬁcation of
information necessary to account for leases, certain accrued liabilities and operating expenses resulting in ineﬁ‘ective process-level controls over the
completeness and accuracy of data and assumptions used to support accounting analyses and reconciliations for the related accounts was identiﬁed.
Our report dated March 9, 2017, on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, contains an explanatory paragraph that states that the Company believes that if it
cannot obtain waivers for the existing events of default under Nextel Brazil's equipment ﬁnancing facility and for the applicable ﬁnancial covenants it is
required to meet as of the December 31, 2017 measurement date, modify the repayment terms on its loans, obtain suitable ﬁnancing if and when it is required,
or obtain access to a signiﬁcant portion of certain escrowed funds as anticipated in its business plan, the Company’s results of operations and liquidity would
be negatively impacted, and the Company may be unable to settle its obligations as they come due. The combination of these conditions continues to raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Our report dated March 9, 2017, on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, contains an explanatory paragraph that states that on June 26, 2015, the Company
satisﬁed the conditions to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 (Successor) and for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 (Successor) have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards
Codiﬁcation Topic 852, Reorganizations. The Company applied fresh-start reporting as of June 30, 2015 and recognized net assets at fair value, resulting in
a lack of comparability with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Predecessor.
