In connection with the completion of the sale of Nextel Argentina to Grupo Clarin in January 2016, the promissory note that was initially issued in
connection with this transaction was canceled. See Note 6 for more information. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we recorded $125.7 million as a
component of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet in connection with the signing of the license agreement related to our acquisition of 30MHz
of spectrum in the 1.8 GHz band in July 2016. Other than these two transactions, we did not have any signiﬁcant non-cash investing or ﬁnancing activities
during the year ended December 31, 2016.
For the six months ended December 31, 2015, we had $25.0 million in non-cash investing activities, representing U.S. treasury notes that we received
and cash placed in escrow to secure our indemniﬁcation obligations in connection with the sale of Nextel Argentina. For the six months ended June 30, 2015,
we had the following non—cash investing and ﬁnancing activities:
° $2,067.7 million in Successor Company common stock that we issued in partial satisfaction of certain claims that were settled in connection with
our emergence from Chapter 11 (see Note 3 for more information); and
° $187.5 million in restricted cash that we received, which represents cash placed in escrow to secure our indemniﬁcation obligations in connection
with the sale of Nextel Mexico.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had $170.9 million, in non-cash ﬁnancing activities, primarily related to the short-term ﬁnancing of
imported handsets and infrastructure in Brazil and co-location capital lease obligations on our communication towers in Brazil.
6. Discontinued Operations
Sale of Nextel Argentina. On September 11, 2015, N11 Mercosur Telecom, S.L.U. and N11 Mercosur Moviles, S.L.U., both of which are indirect
subsidiaries of N11 Holdings, entered into a binding agreement with Grupo Clarin relating to the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests of Nextel
Communications Argentina, S.R.L., or Nextel Argentina. This agreement provided for aggregate cash consideration of $178.0 million, of which $159.0
million was paid at signing in connection with the transfer of a 49% equity interest in Nextel Argentina and the grant of a call option that allowed Grupo
Clarin or any of its afﬁliates to acquire the remaining 51% equity interest in Nextel Argentina upon receipt of required approvals from the regulatory
authorities in Argentina. We received the remaining cash consideration in October 2015, including $6.0 million deposited in escrow to satisfy potential
indemniﬁcation claims. On January 27, 2016, the agreement was amended to permit Grupo Clarin or any of its afﬁliates to exercise the right to acquire the
remaining 51% equity interest prior to receiving regulatory approval, and Grupo Clarin and its affiliates immediately acquired the remaining 51% of Nextel
Argentina for no additional proceeds. In the second half of 20 1 6,
