4. Selling and marketing expenses
The $60.4 million, or 34%, decrease in selling and marketing expenses on a reported basis during 2016 compared to the combined period ended
December 31, 2015 is primarily due to a reduction in sales and marketing personnel, lower advertising and media expenses resulting from cost reductions and
retail store closures, and lower commissions due to a decrease in gross subscriber additions. Most of these cost reductions were the result of our efforts to align
our costs with our business plan. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's selling and marketing expenses decreased 31% during 2016 compared to the
combined period ended December 31, 2015.
5. General and administrative expenses
The $82.9 million, or 17%, decrease in general and administrative expenses on a reported basis during 2016 compared to the combined period ended
December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of lower customer care expenses related to a decrease in the number of calls Nextel Brazil has received in its call
centers, a reduction in payroll costs resulting from fewer general and administrative personnel following reductions in force and a decrease in bad debt
expense primarily resulting from higher levels in 2015 caused by deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by
increases in certain consulting expenses. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's general and administrative expenses decreased 13% during 2016
compared to the combined period ended December 31, 2015.
