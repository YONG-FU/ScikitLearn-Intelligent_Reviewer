In Brazil, our spectrum holdings include 20 megahertz, or MHz, of 1.9 gigahertz, or GHz,/2.1 GHz spectrum and 20 MHz of 1.8 GHz spectrum that
support our WCDMAnetwork and, in Rio de Janeiro, our LTE network. We also have spectrum holdings in the 800 MHZ specialized mobile radio,
or SMR, spectrum band that currently can only be used to support our iDEN network. We valued Nextel Brazil's spectrum licenses using both the
income approach and the market approach. The resulting value of these licenses was similar to the prices observed for comparable licenses in Brazil
in recent guideline transactions. Our income approach used the Greenﬁeld method speciﬁcally, whereby we estimated the discounted ﬁlture cash
ﬂows of a hypothetical start-up business, based on certain assumptions, including: (i) forecasted revenues, proﬁt margins, capital expenditures and
cash ﬂows attributable to the spectrum for the period from July 1, 2015 to June 1, 2041. This date represents the end of the current term of our
spectrum licenses, including renewals solely at our option; and (ii) a discount rate of 16.5%, which is based on an after-tax weighted average cost of
capital.
We valued our customer relationships using the excess earnings method, which is a form of the income approach, by estimating the discounted
future cash ﬂows attributable to existing subscribers. This estimation was based on certain assumptions, including: (i) forecasted revenues and cash
ﬂows attributable to the current subscriber base beginning on July 1, 2015; (ii) a churn rate ranging from 1.9% to 2.6%; and (iii) a discount rate of
16.5%, based on an after-tax weighted average cost of capital.

Our trade name represents the right to use the Nextel name exclusively in our markets. We valued our trade name using the relief from
royalty method, a form of the income approach that estimates the amount a market participant would pay to utilize that trade name, based on
certain assumptions, including (i) forecasted revenues attributable to the trade name from July 1, 2015 to June 1, 2041; (ii) a royalty rate of 0.25 %
of expected revenues determined with regard to comparable market transactions; and (iii) a discount rate of 16.5%, which was based on an after-tax
weighted average cost of capital.
(g) Represents a $13.5 million decrease in non-income based tax assets to reduce their values to their estimated fair values based on discounted cash
ﬂows to reﬂect the timing of their anticipated realization and a $5.2 million write-off of prepaid rent.
