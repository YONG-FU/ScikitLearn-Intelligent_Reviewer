available to us or is delayed for a signiﬁcant amount of time, we would need to obtain additional funding within the next six to twelve months and
signiﬁcantly reduce our planned spending to further preserve our liquidity.
If we cannot obtain waivers for the existing events of default under Nextel Brazil's equipment ﬁnancing facility and for the applicable ﬁnancial
covenants we are required to meet as of the December 31, 2017 measurement date, modify the repayment terms of our loans, obtain suitable ﬁnancing if and
when it is required, or obtain access to a signiﬁcant portion of the escrowed funds as anticipated in our business plan, our results of operations and liquidity
would be negatively impacted, and we may be unable to settle our obligations as they come due. The combination of these conditions continues to raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
In making the assessment of our funding needs and the adequacy of our current sources of ﬁnding, we have considered:
- cash and cash equivalents on hand and short-term investments available to ﬁnd our operations;
- restricted cash currently held in escrow to secure our indemniﬁcation obligations in connection with the sale of Nextel Mexico;
- the ﬁiture return of cash pledged as collateral to secure certain performance bonds relating to our obligations to deploy our spectrum in Brazil;
- expected cash ﬂows from our operations in Brazil;
- the timing of spectrum payments, including ongoing fees for spectrum use;
0 our anticipated level of capital expenditures;
- our scheduled debt service obligations;
- our other contractual obligations; and
- cash income and other taxes.
In addition to the factors described above, the anticipated cash needs of our business, as well as the conclusions presented herein regarding our liquidity
needs, could change signiﬁcantly:
- based on the continued development of our business plans and strategy;
0 if currency values in Brazil depreciate or appreciate relative to the U.S. dollar in a manner that is more signiﬁcant than we currently expect and
assume as part of our plans;
- if economic conditions in Brazil do not improve or worsen;
- if competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry in Brazil change materially from those currently prevailing or from
those now anticipated; or
- if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash ﬂow or proﬁtability of our business.
E. Effect of Inﬂation and Foreign Currency Exchange
Our net assets are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in Brazilian reais. Additionally, some of Nextel
Brazil's debt is denominated entirely in US. dollars, which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risks. We conduct business solely in Brazil where the rate
of inﬂation has historically been signiﬁcantly higher than that of the US. We seek to protect our earnings from inﬂation and possible currency depreciation
by periodically adjusting the local currency prices charged by Nextel Brazil for sales of handsets and services to its subscribers. We routinely monitor our
foreign currency exposure and the cost effectiveness of hedging instruments.
Inﬂation is not currently a material factor affecting our business, although rates of inﬂation in Brazil have been historically volatile. General operating
expenses such as salaries, employee beneﬁts and lease costs are, however, subject to normal inﬂationary pressures. From time to time, we may experience
price changes in connection with the purchase of system infrastructure equipment and handsets, but we do not currently believe that any of these price
changes will be material to our business.
