towers in Brazil in 2013, which are guaranteed by NIIT.
(2) These amounts principally include future lease costs related to our transmitter and receiver sites and switches, as well as our office facilities.
(3) These amounts include maximum contractual purchase obligations under various agreements with our vendors, including the roaming and RAN
sharing agreements that Nextel Brazil entered into with Telefonica in May 2016. See Note 9 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for more
information regarding these agreements.
(4) These amounts include a loan agreement with the China Development Bank in Brazil to ﬁnance infrastructure equipment, which is guaranteed by
N11 Holdings. These amounts also include future interest payments to which we are contractually obligated in the periods in which they are due. As a
result of certain events of default related to this facility, we classiﬁed the principal amount outstanding under this facility as due in less than one
year. We are contractually obligated to make principal payments of $48.9 million in less than one year, $97.9 million in one to three years, $97.9
million in three to ﬁve years and the remaining $48.9 million in more than ﬁve years under this equipment ﬁnancing facility.
(5) These amounts represent principal and interest payments associated with our local bank loans in Brazil and include ﬁiture interest payments to
which we are contractually obligated in the periods in which they are due. Because it is unlikely that we will be able to satisfy one of the applicable
ﬁnancial covenants included in this loan agreement as of the next measurement date at December 31, 2017, we classiﬁed the principal amount
outstanding under these local bank loans as due in less than one year. Based on foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2016,
we are contractually obligated to make principal payments of $79.5 million in less than one year and the remaining $157.9 million in one to three
years under these local bank loans.
(6) These amounts represent principal and interest payments in connection with the signing of the license agreement related to our acquisition of
30MHz ofspectrum in the 1.8 GHz band in July 2016.
(7) These amounts include our current estimates of asset retirement obligations based on our expectations as to future retirement costs, inﬂation rates
and timing of retirements, as well as amounts related to our uncertain income tax positions.
Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures, including capitalized interest, were $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, $72.6
million for the six months ended December 31, 2015, $69.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and $233.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2014. We have reduced our investments in capital expenditures, including making substantial reductions to our investments in network development and
deployment. We expect to continue these efforts to conserve our cash resources while simultaneously meeting the capacity needs of our network.
Our capital spending and related expenses are expected to be driven by several factors, including:
- the amount we spend to enhance our WCDMA network in Brazil and deploy LTE;
0 the extent to which we expand the coverage of our network in new or existing market areas;
- the number of additional transmitter and receiver sites we build in order to increase system capacity, maintain system quality and meet our
regulatory requirements, as well as the costs associated with the installation of network infrastructure and switching equipment; and
- the costs we incur in connection with non-network related information technology projects.
