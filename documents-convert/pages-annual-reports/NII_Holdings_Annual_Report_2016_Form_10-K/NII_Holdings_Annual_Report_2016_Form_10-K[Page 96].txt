Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock UnitAwardS
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2015, the six months ended June 30, 2015 and the year ended December
31, 2014, we recognized $3.4 million, $1.9 million, $2.3 million and $10.4 million, respectively, in share-based compensation expense related to restricted
stock and restricted stock units. The amounts recognized in our consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income for tax beneﬁts related to share-based
payment arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2016, the six months ended December 31, 2015, the six months ended June 30, 2015 and the year
ended December 31, 2014 were not material. We include substantially all share-based compensation expense as a component of selling, general and
administrative expenses.
As a result of the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 proceedings, all prior restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted under the 2012
Incentive Compensation Plan were canceled. As of December 31, 2016, restricted stock represented both non-vested restricted stock awards and restricted
stock units. Our restricted stock awards generally vest thirty-three percent per year over a three-year period. The following table summarizes restricted stock
activity under the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan, for the year ended December 31, 2016:

If a participant's employment is terminated without cause prior to the vesting dates, the participant shall receive restricted stock on a pro-rata
basis based on the fraction of the performance period that has elapsed from the beginning of the performance period until the participant's termination. Any
unvested shares are forfeited and available for reissuance under the terms of the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan. The fair value of our restricted stock is
determined based on the quoted price of our common stock at the grant date. As of December 31, 2016, there was $3.1 million in unrecognized compensation
cost related to restricted stock. We expect this cost to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.49 years. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the
value of our vested restricted stock awards was immaterial.
13. Segment Information
We have determined our reportable segment based on our method of internal reporting, which disaggregates our business by geographic location. We
evaluate performance and provide resources to it based on operating income before depreciation, amortization and impairment, restructuring and other
charges, which we refer to as segment earnings. Nextel Brazil is our only reportable segment.
