C. Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2016, we had a working capital deﬁcit of $1 19.7 million compared to a working capital deﬁcit of $177.4 million as of December
31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, our working capital included $257.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which $3.5 million was held by Nextel
Brazil in Brazilian reais, and $73 .9 million in short-term investments, the majority of which was held in Brazilian reais. In addition, as of December 31, 2016,
we had $87.4 million of cash collateral securing certain performance bonds relating to our obligations to deploy spectrum in Brazil, of which we recorded
$56.5 million as a component of other assets and the remaining $30.9 million of which we recorded as a component of prepaid expenses and other in our
consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016, we also had $163.4 million in cash held in escrow in connection with the sale of Nextel Mexico and
$85.1 million in judicial deposits in Brazil, both of which we classiﬁed as restricted cash.
A substantial portion of our U.S. dollar-denominated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is held in bank deposits, and our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments held in Brazilian reais are typically maintained in a combination of money market ﬁlnds, highly liquid overnight
securities and ﬁxed income investments. The values of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that are held in Brazilian reais will ﬂuctuate in
U.S. dollars based on changes in the exchange rate of the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar.

The following is a discussion of the primary sources and uses of cash in our operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities.
We used $45.2 million of cash in our operating activities during 2016, which represents a $288.0 million improvement from the combined year ended
December 31, 2015, largely caused by lower operating losses resulting from cost reduction efforts and the sale of our operations in Mexico, partially offset by
a $76.9 million upfront payment related to Nextel Brazil's roaming and RAN sharing agreements with Telefonica. We used $78.5 million and $254.8 million
of cash in our operating activities during the six months ended December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively, primarily to fund operating losses and
interest expense. We used $176.3 million less cash during the six months ended December 31, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015
primarily as a result of lower operating losses in Brazil and cash conservation efforts both in Brazil and at the corporate level. We used $628.7 million of cash
in our operating activities during 2014, primarily due to operating losses, interest expense and the prepayment of certain costs associated with a roaming
arrangement in Brazil.
Our investing activities provided us with $54.5 million of cash during 2016, primarily due to $81.1 million of net cash returned to us from the release
of performance bonds and $27.4 million in net proceeds from maturities of our short-term investments in Brazil and at the corporate level, partially offset by
$61.3 million in cash capital expenditures and $13.2 million we paid for judicial deposits.
We used $1.0 million of cash in our investing activities during the six months ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to $76.6 million in cash capital
expenditures and $50.5 million in deposits to secure certain performance bonds relating to our obligations to deploy spectrum in Brazil, offset by net cash
proceeds of $153.8 million that we received in connection with the sale of Nextel Argentina (excluding $18.1 million of U.S. treasury notes received as part
of the proceeds). Our investing activities provided us with $1,027.8 million in cash during the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to the sale of
Nextel Mexico
