4. Impairment, Restructuring and Other Charges
Long-Lived Asset Impairment.
During 2016, we reviewed our Nextel Brazil segment for potential impairment. While we are focused on effectively managing our business in Brazil, we
are also considering potential strategic alternatives with third parties. Taking into consideration the current macroeconomic conditions in Brazil, our history
of operating losses and the available sources of capital to fund our business plan, we currently believe that the most likely outcome for the future of our
business is the sale of Nextel Brazil. We compared the carrying value of Nextel Brazil's long-lived assets to our estimate of undiscounted future cash ﬂows.
Our estimate of undiscounted future cash ﬂows was probability-weighted and took into consideration our ability to obtain capital necessary to ﬁnd our
business plan. In addition, we assumed that the proceeds from any potential sale of Nextel Brazil would be signiﬁcantly less than its carrying value. Based on
our estimates, we determined that the carrying value of our Nextel Brazil segment was not fully recoverable.
As a result, we recorded a non—cash asset impairment charge of $1.34 billion to reduce the carrying values of Nextel Brazil's long-lived assets to their
respective fair values. We estimated the fair value of our Nextel Brazil segment using a market approach. While we may ultimately complete a sale with a
third party that is valued at more or less than our current market value, we estimated the fair value of our equity based on our market capitalization and
combined it with the fair value of our outstanding debt obligations to determine the impairment charge. See Note 8 for more information on our estimate of
the fair value of our debt obligations. We allocated the non-cash asset impairment charge ﬁrst to reduce the $36.8 million carrying value of our trademark
intangible asset to zero, and the remainder between property, plant and equipment and spectrum licenses on a pro rata basis.
0th er Asset Impairments.
During 2016, Nextel Brazil recognized $11.0 million, in non-cash asset impairment charges primarily related to the abandonment of certain transmitter
and receiver sites that are no longer required in its business.
During the six months ended December 31, 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized $12.6 million and $31.1 million in non-cash
asset impairment charges, the majority of which related to the shutdown or abandonment of transmitter and receiver sites that are no longer required in Nextel
Brazil's business, retail store closures related to the realignment of distribution channels in Brazil and the discontinuation of certain information technology
projects in Brazil and at the corporate level.
In 2014, we evaluated strategic options for the next generation of our push-to-talk services and determined that, for one of these options, further
development was no longer probable. As a result, we recognized a $42.8 million asset impairment charge which was recognized at the corporate level.
We also recognized a $6.4 million asset impairment charge at the corporate level related to the sale of our corporate aircraft in 2014.
