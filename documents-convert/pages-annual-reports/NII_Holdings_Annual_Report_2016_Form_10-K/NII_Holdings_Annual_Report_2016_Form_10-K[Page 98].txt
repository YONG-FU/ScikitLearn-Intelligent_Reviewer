During 2016, we recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $ 1 .34 billion to reduce the carrying values of Nextel Brazil's long-lived assets to their
respective fair values. See Note 4 for more information on this impairment charge.
In connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2016, we determined that
an error existed in our previously issued ﬁnancial statements. Speciﬁcally, selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were
understated by $6.9 million as the result of a failure to properly accrue expenses for services Nextel Brazil received under a management consulting services
arrangement. As a result of the correction of this error, for the fourth quarter of 20 1 5, operating loss and net loss from continuing operations increased by $6.9
million. In addition, for the fourth quarter of 2015, the correction of this error resulted in a $0.07 increase in both net loss from continuing operations per
basic and diluted common share.
The sum of the per share amounts do not equal the annual amounts due to changes in the number of weighted average common shares outstanding
during the year.
In September 2015, two of our indirect subsidiaries entered into a binding agreement with Grupo Clarin relating to the sale of all of the outstanding
equity interests of Nextel Argentina. In April 2015, we completed the sale of our Mexican operations to
