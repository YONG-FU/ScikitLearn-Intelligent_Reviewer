As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.4 billion of net operating loss carryforwards for US. Federal and state income tax purposes, which expire in various
amounts beginning in 2027 through 2036. Due to our emergence from bankruptcy on June 26, 2015, the timing and manner in which we will utilize the net
operating loss carryforwards in any year will be limited relating to changes in our ownership. The annual limitation is $40.2 million, and some of our net
operating loss carryforwards will expire before use in the future due to this limitation. As a result of this limitation, our net operating loss carryforwards for
US. Federal and state income tax purposes are $888.1 million.
As of December 31, 2016, our Brazilian subsidiaries had $1.6 billion of net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward indeﬁnitely, but the
amount that we can utilize annually is limited to 30% of Brazilian taxable income before the net operating loss deduction. Our foreign subsidiaries' ability to
utilize the foreign tax net operating losses in any single year ultimately depends upon their ability to generate sufﬁcient taxable income.
As of December 31, 2016, our holding companies in Luxembourg each had net operating losses ranging from $1.2 billion to $8.5 billion that can be
carried forward indeﬁnitely. Our holding companies in Spain had $847.9 million of net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward 18 years, and
our holding company in the Netherlands had an immaterial amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be carried forward nine years. Given the
nature of activities that are considered taxable in these jurisdictions and the activities engaged in by the holding companies, these net operating loss
carryforwards will never be utilized by our holding companies.
The deferred tax asset valuation allowances that our subsidiaries and holding companies had as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:
