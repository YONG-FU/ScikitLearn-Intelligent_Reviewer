Brazil RAN Sharing Commitment.
In May 2016, Nextel Brazil entered into an amendment to a nationwide roaming voice and data services agreement with Telefonica Brazil, S.A., or
Telefonica, to reduce the usage rates for roaming trafﬁc. Concurrently, Nextel Brazil entered into a 10-year RAN sharing agreement with Telefonica, under
which Telefonica will permit Nextel Brazil to use some of its tower and equipment infrastructure to transmit telecommunications signals on Nextel Brazil's
spectrum. Nextel Brazil expects to use this agreement to fulﬁll the regulatory coverage obligations under its spectrum licenses rather than utilizing its own
network. These agreements require Nextel Brazil to meet certain minimum annual commitments over a ﬁve-year period totaling 800 million Brazilian reais,
or approximately $246.2 million based on foreign currency exchange rates at the time, which replaced the remaining commitments under the original
roaming agreement. Nextel Brazil was required to prepay 250 million Brazilian reais, or approximately $76.9 million based on foreign currency exchange
rates at the time, shortly after the agreements became effective with receipt of regulatory approvals, which occurred in August 2016.
We are allocating the aggregate 800 million Brazilian reais in minimum payments on a relative fair value basis to the services being received. We are
recognizing approximately 318 million Brazilian reais on a ratable basis over a period of ﬁve years for the amended roaming agreement, which began in
August 2016, and approximately 482 million Brazilian reais over a period of approximately eight years for the RAN sharing agreement, which began in
October2016.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, Nextel Brazil negotiated the early termination of leases for approximately 600 transmitter and receiver sites in connection
with this RAN sharing agreement and recognized restructuring costs related to these terminations. See Note 4 for more information. We expect to incur
restructuring costs of approximately $30.0 million in 2017 in connection with the termination of an additional 1,400 transmitter and receiver sites in low-
usage areas.
Equipment, Handsets and Other Commitments.
We are a party to purchase agreements with various suppliers, under which we have committed to purchase equipment, network services and handsets
that will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2016, we are committed to purchase $439.1 million in total under these
arrangements, which includes amounts related to the RAN sharing agreement discussed above, $276.2 million of which we are committed to pay in 2017,
$87.9 million of which we are committed to pay in 2018 and 2019, and the remaining $75.0 million of which we are committed to pay in 2020 and 2021.
These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual
obligations. Our commitments are generally determined based on noncancelable quantities or termination amounts. We also purchase products and services
as needed with no ﬁrm commitment. Amounts actually paid under some of these agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these
agreements. The more signiﬁcant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include such items as hours contracted, subscribers and
other factors. In addition, we are a party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of
certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or a product.
