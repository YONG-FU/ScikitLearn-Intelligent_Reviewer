Item 6. Selected Financial Data
On September 15, 2014, we and eight of our US. and Luxembourg-domiciled subsidiaries, including NII Capital Corp. and NIIT ﬁled voluntary
petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which we refer to as Chapter 11, in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York, which we refer to as the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, subsequent to September 15, 2014, ﬁve additional
subsidiaries of NH Holdings, Inc. ﬁled voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. We refer to the companies that ﬁled
voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 collectively as the Debtors. Nextel Brazil and our previous other operating subsidiaries in Latin America
were not Debtors in these Chapter 11 cases.
On June 19, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and conﬁrming the First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Proposed by the
Plan Debtors and the Ofﬁcial Committee of Unsecured Creditors, dated April 20, 2015. We refer to this plan, as amended, as the Plan of Reorganization. On
June 26, 2015, the conditions of the Bankruptcy Court's order and the Plan of Reorganization were satisﬁed, the Plan of Reorganization became eﬁ‘ective,
and we and the other Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings. We refer to June 26, 2015 as the Emergence Date.
In connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, we were required to apply the provisions of fresh start accounting to our ﬁnancial statements.
Because our results of operations during the period from June 26, 2015 to June 30, 2015 were not material, we applied fresh start accounting to our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of the close of business on June 30, 2015.As a result of the application of fresh start accounting and other events related
to our reorganization under Chapter 11, the Successor Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended December 31, 2015 are prepared under a new
basis of accounting and are not directly comparable to the Predecessor Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
The tables below set forth selected consolidated ﬁnancial data for the periods or as of the dates indicated and should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and notes thereto in Item 8 of this report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. The selected consolidated ﬁnancial data presented below includes the results of Nextel Brazil and our corporate
headquarters. In connection with the sales of Nextel Argentina, Nextel Mexico, Nextel Chile and Nextel Peru, we have included the results of these former
operating companies for all periods presented as discontinued operations in the tables below. For more information regarding material uncertainties in our
business, see Note 1 and Note 9 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
