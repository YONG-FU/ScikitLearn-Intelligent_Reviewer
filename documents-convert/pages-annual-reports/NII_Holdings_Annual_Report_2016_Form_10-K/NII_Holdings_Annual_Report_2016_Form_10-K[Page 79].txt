Restructuring Charges.
During the fourth quarter of 20 1 6, in connection with the radio access network, or RAN, sharing agreement Nextel Brazil entered into in May 2016, we
negotiated the early termination of certain leases with one of Nextel Brazil's tower operators. As a result, we recorded $21.4 million in restructuring costs in
the fourth quarter of 20 1 6 related to the early termination of leases for approximately 600 transmitter and receiver sites. We expect these costs to be disbursed
over the next eight years. See Note 9 for more information related to this RAN sharing agreement.
During 2016, we recognized $3.2 million in severance and other related costs at the corporate level. In addition, during 2016, Nextel Brazil recognized
$10.8 million in restructuring charges primarily related to future lease costs for certain transmitter and receiver sites that are no longer required in its business
and certain office closures.

We also recognized $5.4 million in severance and other related costs at the corporate level during the six months ended June 30, 2015 related to the
