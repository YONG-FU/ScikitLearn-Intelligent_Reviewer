PART I
Item 1. Business
Corporate History
Overview. We were originally organized in 1995 as a holding company for the operations of Nextel Communications, Inc. in selected international
markets. The corporation that is currently known as NII Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2000 as Nextel International, Inc. In December 2001,
we changed our name from Nextel International, Inc. to NH Holdings, Inc. Our principal executive ofﬁce is located at 1875 Explorer Street, Suite 800, Reston,
Vlrginia 20190. Our telephone number at that location is (703) 390-5100. Unless the context requires otherwise, “NII Holdings, Inc.,” “NII Holdings,” “we,”
“our,” “us” and “the Company” refer to the combined businesses of N11 Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our wholly-owned
Brazilian operating company, Nextel Telecomunicacoes Ltda., as Nextel Brazil. Nextel Brazil's operations are headquartered in Sao Paulo, with branch
ofﬁces in Rio de Janeiro and various other cities in Brazil.
Except as otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in United States, or US, dollars and references to “dollars” and “$” are to US. dollars. All
historical ﬁnancial statements contained in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US.
Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings. On September 15, 2014, we and eight of our US. and Luxembourg-domiciled subsidiaries, including NII
Capital Corp. and NH International Telecom, S.C.A., or NIIT, ﬁled voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, which we refer to as Chapter 11, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which we refer to as the
Bankruptcy Court. In addition, subsequent to September 15 , 2014, ﬁve additional subsidiaries of NH Holdings ﬁled voluntary petitions seeking relief under
Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court. We refer to the companies that ﬁled voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 collectively as the Debtors.
Nextel Brazil and our previous other operating subsidiaries in Latin America were not Debtors in these Chapter 11 cases.
As described in more detail in Note 3 to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, on June 19, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and
conﬁrming the Plan of Reorganization. On June 26, 2015, the conditions of the Bankruptcy Court's order and the Plan of Reorganization were satisﬁed, the
Plan of Reorganization became effective, and we and the other Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings.
In accordance with the requirements of reorganization accounting, NII Holdings adopted the provisions of fresh start accounting as of June 30, 2015
and became a new entity for ﬁnancial reporting purposes. References to the "Successor Company" relate to NH Holdings on or subsequent to June 30, 2015.
References to the "Predecessor Company" relate to NH Holdings prior to June 30, 2015. For purposes of comparison to the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2014, we combined the results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2015 with the results of operations for the six months ended June 30,
2015. However, as a result of the application of fresh start accounting and other events related to our reorganization under Chapter 11, the Successor
Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended December 31, 2015 are prepared under a new basis of accounting and are not directly comparable to the
Predecessor Company's ﬁnancial results for the six months ended June 30, 2015. For the same reasons, our results of operations for the combined twelve-
month period ended December 31, 2015 are not ﬁilly comparable to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2014.
Divestitures. On January 27, 2016, two of our indirect subsidiaries completed the sale of ourArgentine operations to Grupo Clarin. The transaction was
structured as a sale of all of the outstanding equity interests of Nextel Communications Argentina, S.R.L., or Nextel Argentina, for an aggregate purchase
price of $178.0 million.
On April 30, 2015, we, together with one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, completed the sale of our Mexican operations to New Cingular \Vlreless, an
indirect subsidiary of AT&T. The transaction was structured as a sale of all the outstanding stock of the parent company of Comunicaciones Nextel de
Mexico, SA. de C.V., or Nextel Mexico, for a purchase price of $1.875 billion, including $187.5 million deposited in escrow to satisfy potential
indemniﬁcation claims. The net proceeds of the sale were $1.448 billion after deducting Nextel Mexico's outstanding indebtedness and applying other
speciﬁed price adjustments.
In August 2014, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary
Nextel Chile, S.A., or Nextel Chile, to Fucata, S.A., a venture comprised of Grupo Veintitres and Optimum Advisors for a de minimus amount.
In August 2013, two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries completed the sale of all of the outstanding equity interests in our wholly-owned subsidiary
Nextel del Peru, S.A., or Nextel Peru, to Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones SA. and one of its subsidiaries, Entel Inversiones, S.A., which we refer to
collectively as Entel.
