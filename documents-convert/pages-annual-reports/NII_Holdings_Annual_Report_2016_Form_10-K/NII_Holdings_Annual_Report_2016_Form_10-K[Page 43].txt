Nextel Brazil’s segment losses decreased $42.5 million, or 32%, on a reported basis, and 58% on a constant currency basis, for the combined period
ending December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as a result of the following:
1. Service and other revenues
The $549.3 million, or 32%, decrease in service and other revenues on a reported basis in the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to
2014 is primarily the result of the impact of weaker foreign currency exchange rates on our reported results and the decline in ARPU discussed above. On a
constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's service and other revenues decreased 4% in the combined period ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014.
Nextel Brazil's WCDMA subscriber base grew from 1.7 million subscribers as of the end of 2014 to 2.8 million subscribers as of the end of 2015. During
2015, Nextel Brazil strategically facilitated the migration of iDEN subscribers to its WCDMAnetwork, which resulted in 312 thousand migrations during the
combined period ended December 31, 2015. As a result of these migrations and the overall growth in its WCDMA subscriber base, Nextel Brazil's WCDMA-
based service and other revenues increased $245.4 million, or 71%, from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31, 2015. This increase was offset by
a $794.8 million, or 59%, decrease in Nextel Brazil's iDEN—based service and other revenues from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31, 2015
driven by a decrease in Nextel Brazil's iDEN subscriber base from 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of 2014 to 1.6 million subscribers as of the end of 2015
and a decline in its iDEN-based average revenue per subscriber from $30 for 2014 to $17 for the combined period ended December 31, 2015. On a constant
currency basis, Nextel Brazil's WCDMA-based service and other revenues increased 142% from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31, 2015 and
its iDEN-based service and other revenues decreased 42% over the same period.
2. Handset and accessory net subsidy
The $160.4 million, or 62%, decrease in handset and accessory net subsidy on a reported basis from 2014 to the combined period ended December 31,
2015 is largely related to an increased emphasis on new service plans under which services are provided to new subscribers using their existing handsets, as
well as lower subsidies per handset. As a result of the new service plans, 70% of Nextel Brazil's new WCDMA subscribers during the combined period ended
December 31, 2015 represented customers who
