the remaining leases and related agreements, among other factors. In addition, Nextel Brazil is foregoing the construction of approximately 700 new
transmitter and receiver sites, which is allowing us to avoid approximately $50.0 million in capital expenditures that we would otherwise have incurred
through the end of 2017, as well as related ﬁiture operating expenses.
Despite decreases in local currency operating revenues, Nextel Brazil recognized segment earnings of $67.2 million, and a segment earnings margin of
7%, during 2016 as a result of the execution of initiatives to reduce operating expenses included in our business plan. Nextel Brazil recognized segment
earnings of $67.2 million during 2016 compared to segment losses of $91.2 million during the combined period ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the
following:
1. Service and other revenues
The $181.8 million, or 16%, decrease in service and other revenues on a reported basis in 2016 compared to the combined period ended December 31,
2015 is primarily the result of the decline in Nextel Brazil's subscriber base and the impact of weaker foreign currency exchange rates on our reported results.
On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's service and other revenues decreased 12% in 2016 compared to the combined period ended December 31, 2015.
Nextel Brazil's WCDMA subscriber base grew slightly from 2.7 million subscribers as of the end of 2015 to 2.8 million subscribers as of the end of
2016. Nextel Brazil has continued to strategically facilitate the migration of iDEN subscribers to its WCDMA network, which resulted in 144 thousand
migrations during 2016. As a result of the increase in its WCDMA service ARPU and the overall growth in its WCDMA subscriber base, Nextel Brazil's
WCDMA-based service and other revenues increased $91.8 million, or 15%, from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016, or 21% on a
constant currency basis. This increase was offset by a $273.6 million, or 50%, decrease in Nextel Brazil's iDEN-based service and other revenues from the
combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016, or 47% on a constant currency basis, driven by a decrease in Nextel Brazil's iDEN subscriber base from
1.6 million subscribers as of the end of 2015 to 0.8 million subscribers as of the end of 2016.
2. Handset and accessory net subsidy
The $92.5 million, or 93%, decrease in handset and accessory net subsidy on a reported basis from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to
2016 is largely related to an increased emphasis on new service plans under which services are provided to new subscribers using their existing handsets, as
well as lower subsidies per handset. As a result of the new service plans, during 2016, 89% of Nextel Brazil's new WCDMA subscribers represented
subscribers who utilized their existing handsets rather than purchasing one from Nextel Brazil compared to 70% during 2015. The decrease in handset and
accessory net subsidy from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016 was also impacted by a $25.3 million charge that Nextel Brazil
recognized in the second quarter of 20 1 5 related to certain tax credits generated as a result of handset purchases that we estimated were not probable of being
recovered. During 2016, we recovered $20.8 million of these credits and expect to recover the remaining portion in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. On a constant
currency basis, Nextel Brazil's handset and accessory net subsidy decreased 92% in 2016 compared to the combined period ended December 31, 2015 .
3. Cost of service
The $104.4 million, or 22%, decrease in cost of service on a reported basis from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016 is primarily the
result of a $57.2 million, or 34%, decrease in interconnect costs related to the reduced volume of calls on Nextel Brazil's iDEN network and lower mobile
termination rates, and a $41.2 million, or 15%, decrease in site and switch costs over the same period. The decrease in cost of service was also partially the
result of the reversal of $8.1 million in certain non—income based tax-related contingent liabilities in the second quarter of 2016 based on a change in
estimate. On a constant currency basis, Nextel Brazil's cost of service decreased 19% from the combined period ended December 31, 2015 to 2016.
In 2012, ANATEL approved regulations to implement a transition to a cost-based model for determining mobile termination rates. Under the current
regulations, the mobile termination rates are being gradually reduced over a transition period ending in 2019, when cost-based rates will take eﬁ‘ect. The
transition rules also provide for a partial "bill and keep" settlement process that applies to the settlement of mobile termination charges between smaller
operators like Nextel Brazil and its larger competitors (who are considered to hold signiﬁcant market power under the Brazilian regulations), which further
reduces mobile termination charges for smaller operators. The lower costs resulting from this partial bill and keep settlement process, which is similar to the
settlement process that has historically applied to termination charges relating to our iDEN services, decline as mobile termination rates are reduced during
the transition period, with the bill and keep settlement process terminating when cost-based rates are implemented.
