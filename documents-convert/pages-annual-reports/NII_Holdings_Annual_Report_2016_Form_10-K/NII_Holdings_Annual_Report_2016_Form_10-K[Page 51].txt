Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we ﬁle or
submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including
our chief executive ofﬁcer and chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of December 31, 2016, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of our management teams in the United States and Brazil, including our chief executive ofﬁcer and chief ﬁnancial
ofﬁcer. Based on and as of the date of such evaluation, our chief executive ofﬁcer and chief ﬁnancial oﬁicer concluded that the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting in Brazil, as
described below. Amaterial weakness is a deﬁciency, or a combination of deﬁciencies, in internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, that creates a reasonable
possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim ﬁnancial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
We performed procedures to mitigate the impact of these deﬁciencies on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, including reviews and validations
performed by staff at our headquarters office who were not part of the ﬁnancial close process in Brazil. Based on these procedures, management believes that
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and present
fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position, results of operations and cash ﬂows of the Company, as of and for the periods presented.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Over the course of 20 1 6, we took a number of actions to improve the control environment and risk assessment processes. Speciﬁcally, we:
- enhanced the formal monthly processes that exist to improve communication between Nextel Brazil’s accounting function and other functional
areas throughout the organization;
- performed a redesigned and enhanced ﬁnancial reporting risk assessment and mapping of key controls;
0 increased the level of accountability for performance of internal controls and for remediation of control deﬁciencies;
