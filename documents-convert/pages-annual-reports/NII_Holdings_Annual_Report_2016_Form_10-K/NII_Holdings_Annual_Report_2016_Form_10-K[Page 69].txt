Derivative Financial Instruments. We occasionally enter into derivative transactions for hedging or risk management purposes. We have not and will
not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or proﬁt generating purposes. See Note 8 for additional information.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets. We review long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment and identiﬁable intangible assets with deﬁnite
useﬁll lives, which include our telecommunications licenses, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash ﬂows of the asset or asset group is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we
recognize a loss, if any, for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset.
Intangible Assets. Prior to our emergence from Chapter 11, intangible assets primarily consisted of our telecommunications licenses. We amortize our
intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated beneﬁt period. As a result of the implementation of fresh start accounting in connection
with our emergence from Chapter 11, we recorded our intangible assets, which consisted of our telecommunications licenses, our exclusive right to use the
Nextel tradename in Brazil and our customer relationships, at their estimated fair values. We calculate amortization on our licenses using the straight—line
method based on an estimated useful life of 26 to 30 years. We calculate amortization on our customer relationships using the straight-line method based on
an estimated useful life of 4 years.
In Brazil, licenses are customarily issued conditionally for speciﬁed periods of time ranging from 10 to 40 years, including renewals. In addition, the
wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing signiﬁcant technological change, and the commercial life of any particular technology is difﬁcult to
predict. In light of these uncertainties, we classify our licenses as deﬁnite lived intangible assets. In connection with the implementation of fresh start
accounting, we revised the remaining estimated useﬁll lives of our licenses to include renewal periods in cases where it is probable that a renewal will occur.
Revenue Recognition. Operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of handsets and
accessories. We present our operating revenues net of value-added taxes, but we include certain revenue-based taxes that are our primary obligation.
