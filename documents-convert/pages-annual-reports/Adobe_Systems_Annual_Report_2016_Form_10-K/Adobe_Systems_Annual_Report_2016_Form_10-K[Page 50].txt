The decrease in loss contingency during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 is due to the reversal of a previously
anticipated loss associated with certain legal proceedings.
Amortization of Purchased Intangibles
During the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of
these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to
fourteen years.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to write-off of certain acquired
intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased
in fiscal 2016.
Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense
associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in
amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day
Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.
