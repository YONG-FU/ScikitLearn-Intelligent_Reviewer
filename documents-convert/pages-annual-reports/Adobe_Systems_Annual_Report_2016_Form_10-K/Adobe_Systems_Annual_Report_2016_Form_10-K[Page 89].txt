measured over a three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the Executive
Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement following the three-year anniversary of each grant date.
Program participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted.
On January 24, 2016, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2016 Performance Share Program, the terms
of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. As of December 2, 2016, the shares awarded
under our 2016, 2015 and 2014 Performance Share Programs are yet to be achieved.
Issuance of Shares
Upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the
ESPP, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact
of on—going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a
stock repurchase program. See Note I 2 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.
Our performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at
grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period.
We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP shares. The determination of the fair
value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility
over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and
any expected dividends.
The expected term of ESPP shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period. The
assumptions used to value employee stock purchase rights were as follows:
7 Fiscal Years 7
: 2016 7 7 2015 7 7 2014
{Expected life (in years) 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 2.0 ‘
Volatility 26 - 29% 26 - 30% 26 - 28%
’Risk free interest rate 0.37 - 1.06% 0.11 - 0.67% 0.06 - 0.47% 1
