NOTE 17. INDUSTRY SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
We report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.
Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable
segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and
intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.
We have the following reportable segments:
- Digital Media—Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium
businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers
include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their
management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include
knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents.
- Digital Marketing—Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising
and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers,
advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief
revenue officers.
- Print and Publishing—Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse
authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM
printing businesses.
