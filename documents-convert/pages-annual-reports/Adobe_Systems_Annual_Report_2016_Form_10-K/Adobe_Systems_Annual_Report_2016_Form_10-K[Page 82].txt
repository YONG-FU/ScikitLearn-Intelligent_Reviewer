As of December 2, 2016, building improvements were presented separately in the above table as these were previously
misclassifled as leasehold improvements. Prior year amounts have also been classiÔ¨Åed as building improvements to the extent
they related to owned buildings. There was no impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the change in
classification.
Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $157.6 million,
$146.3 million and $144.2 million, respectively.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, management approved a plan to sell land and an unoccupied building located in San
Jose, California. The total carrying value of the property assets was $36.3 million which mostly pertained to the land. The decision
to sell these property assets was largely based upon a general lack of operational needs for the building and land, and improvements
in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area. We began to actively market the assets during the second quarter of
fiscal 2015 and finalized the sale of these assets on September 23, 2015 for total proceeds of $57.8 million. The gain on the sale
of the property assets was included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
