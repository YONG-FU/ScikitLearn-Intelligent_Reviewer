Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared to fiscal 2014.
Contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our AEM term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in
revenue associated with Adobe Campaign, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target.
