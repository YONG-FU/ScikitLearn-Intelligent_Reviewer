Subscription
Cost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure,
including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and
related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of
intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for the use of their data center facilities and
our data center costs largely consist of amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.

Data center costs increased during ﬁscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the continued increase in transaction
volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Increases in data center costs were partially offset by decreases
in amortization of purchased intangibles driven by the decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased
through our acquisitions of Omniture and Efficient Frontier that became fully amortized in the latter part of fiscal 2015.
Data center costs increased during ﬁscal 2O 15 compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our
Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures
as we invested in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business.
Royalty costs increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings and increased royalties
due to the introduction of our stock photography offering. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to
amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.
