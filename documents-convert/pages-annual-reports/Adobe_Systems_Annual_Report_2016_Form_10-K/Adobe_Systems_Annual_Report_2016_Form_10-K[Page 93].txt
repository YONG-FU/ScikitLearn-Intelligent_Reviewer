Stock Repurchase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the
ﬁrst quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up
to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.
During ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million, and $600 million, respectively.
The $1.08 billion prepayments during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. Of the prepayments of $625 .0 million
made during fiscal 2015, $425.0 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200.0 million were under the previous
$2 billion authority. The $600 million prepayments made during fiscal 2014 were under the previous $2 billion authority. We enter
into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average
Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount
that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions.
There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no
requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon
discount. During ﬁscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $97. 16 through structured
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During ﬁscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1
million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal
2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price per share of $63.48 through
structured repurchase agreements entered into during ﬁscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2016, November 27, 2015 and November 28,
2014 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2016, $100. 1 million of prepayments remained
under the agreement.
