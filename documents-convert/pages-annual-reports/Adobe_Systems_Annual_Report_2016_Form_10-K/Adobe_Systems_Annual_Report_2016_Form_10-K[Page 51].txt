Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed
income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and
foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.
Interest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the gain on the sale of
certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and the increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset by the increase in
interest income due to increased average investment balance and interest rates.
Interest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on
the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. See
Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.
Interest Expense
Interest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior
notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are
paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest
payments. See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate
swaps.
Interest expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in ﬂoating rate on
interest rate swap and higher average debt balances.
Interest expense increased during fiscal 2O 15 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially
offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps.
Investment Gains (Losses), Net
Investment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments,
other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and
losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with
our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.
