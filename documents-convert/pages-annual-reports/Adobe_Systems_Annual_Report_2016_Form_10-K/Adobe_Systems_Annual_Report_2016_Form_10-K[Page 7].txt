Print and Publishing
Our Print and Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including
eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals
and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostS cript
and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace.
As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workﬂows, we believe we are well positioned to be
a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry.
We generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workﬂow software, printers and other output
devices. In fiscal 2016, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and
license in our Print and Publishing business.
