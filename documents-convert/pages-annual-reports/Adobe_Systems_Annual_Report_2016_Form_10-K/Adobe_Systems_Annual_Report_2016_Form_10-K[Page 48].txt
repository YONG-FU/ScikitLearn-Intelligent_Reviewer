As a result of redirecting our focus and development efforts towards our Creative Cloud and other subscription offerings,
amortization of purchased intangibles and localization costs decreased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering.
Cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and
obsolete inventory, cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. The
increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition
of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.

party fees related to consulting and training services provided to our customers.
