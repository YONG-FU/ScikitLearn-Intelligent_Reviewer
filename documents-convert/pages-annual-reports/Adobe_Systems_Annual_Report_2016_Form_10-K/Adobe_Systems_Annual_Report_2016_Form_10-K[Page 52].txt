Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.
The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and
the permanent extension of the US. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was
retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reﬂected in its entirety in the first quarter of
ﬁscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 eﬁective
tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies, offset by
tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the US. Research and Development credit in December 2014.
Our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The
increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe’s trading companies. The
increase was partially offset by tax beneﬁts related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in
December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014.
We are aUnited States-based multinational company subj ect to tax in multiple U. S. and foreign tax j urisdictions. A significant
portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for US.
income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for US. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless
the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing
our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested
are repatriated, the related US. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there
is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which US. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016 was $178.4 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.
If the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 2, 2016 were recognized in the future, $144.5 million of unrecognized tax
benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $33 .9 million federal benefit related to deducting certain
payments on future federal and state tax returns.
As of December 2, 2016, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax
returns was approximately $22.4 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large ﬂuctuations in the balance of current and non-current
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging
from $0 to approximately $10 million.
During fiscal 2016, a number of income tax examinations covering our fiscal years 2010 to 2016 were completed. Of the
signiﬁcant examinations, accrued tax and interest related to these years were $95.6 million and were previously reported in non-
current income taxes payable. We settled the tax obligation resulting from these examinations with cash and income tax assets
totaling $35.3 million, and the resulting $60.3 million income tax beneﬁt was recorded in fiscal 2016.
