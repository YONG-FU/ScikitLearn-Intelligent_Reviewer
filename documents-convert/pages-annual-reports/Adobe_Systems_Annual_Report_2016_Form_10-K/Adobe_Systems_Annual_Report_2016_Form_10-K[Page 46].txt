Included in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were impacts associated with foreign currency as
shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.

During fiscal 2016, the US. Dollar strengthened against the Euro and British Pound which negatively impacted revenue
in EMEA measured in US. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA currencies
hedging programs during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, the U. S. Dollar weakened against the Japanese Yen, the impact of which
was oﬁset by the impact of the US. Dollar strengthening against other Asian currencies.
During fiscal 2015, the US. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies
which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA and APAC measured in US. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by
hedging gains from our EMEA currencies and Japanese Yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015.

Backlog
Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue
recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-
cancelable commercial subscription, SAAS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses.
Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription,
SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial
statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of
December 2, 2016, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.4 billion of which approximately 40% to 50%
is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017. Comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of
approximately $2.9 billion as of November 27, 2015, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be
billed during fiscal 2016.
We expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors,
including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles
of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes
in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency ﬂuctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for
multi—year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior
to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, ﬂuctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog
may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.
