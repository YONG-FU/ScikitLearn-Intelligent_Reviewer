Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
During fiscal 2016 and 2015, our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized
as follows (in thousands):

As of December 2, 2016, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax
returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was approximately $22.4 million.
We file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many US. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are
subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our
major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest
ﬁscal years open for examination are 2008, 2010 and 2013, respectively. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments
that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance
that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial
position.
The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments
that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large ﬂuctuations in the balance of current and non-current
assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain
audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties
described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging
from $0 to approximately $10 million.
NOTE 10. BENEFIT PLANS
Retirement Savings Plan
In 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is
a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U. S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings
Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the Internal Revenue
Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2016, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We
contributed $33.4 million, $25.7 million and $24.8 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are under no obligation
to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.
Deferred Compensation Plan
On September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan,
effective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified,
deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a
portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified
compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’
fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan
year in which election is made. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in the form of a lump sum or annual installments
