NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Although our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel
their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a
customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.
On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends
and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to
determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future
returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated
requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product
plans and other factors.

Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions
described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reﬂects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables.
The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering
such factors as historical experience, credit—worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions
that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.

Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment
as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and ﬁxtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements
and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.
