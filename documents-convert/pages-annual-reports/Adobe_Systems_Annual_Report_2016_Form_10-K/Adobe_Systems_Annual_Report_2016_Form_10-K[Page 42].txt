We are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Digital Marketing
business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital
experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization.
We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize
and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. With its broad set
of solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe
Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime, as well as real-time dashboards and a collaborative interface,
customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized, relevant
experience to their constituents.
In addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions include marketing
professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. Customers also
include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in workﬂows that
utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media oﬁerings and our video workﬂow and delivery technologies. By combining
the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more
efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workﬂow
and feedback loop.
We utilize a direct salesforce to market and license our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem
of partners including marketing agencies, systems integrators and developers that help license and deploy our solutions to their
customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent
ﬁnancial results reﬂect the success of these investments. In fiscal 2016, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63
billion, which represents 20% year-over-year revenue growth. In December 2016, we acquired TubeMogul and we will integrate
TubeMogul in our Digital Marketing business in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect that the addition of TubeMogul and
sustained demand across our portfolio of Marketing Cloud solutions will drive revenue growth in future years.
