Senior Notes
As of December 2, 2016, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying
value of $ 1 .90 billion. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 2,
2016, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $425.9 million for the remaining duration of our
Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a
ﬂoating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a fixed number of basis points through February
1,2020.
Covenants
Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our Almaden Tower
lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreement that are reported to the lessor quarterly. As of December 2,
2016, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming
ﬁscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants.
Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless
payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable
future.
