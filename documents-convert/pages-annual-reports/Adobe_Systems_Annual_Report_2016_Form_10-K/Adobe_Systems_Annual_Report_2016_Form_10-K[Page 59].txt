Interest Rate Risk
Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At December 2, 2016, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.75 billion. Changes in interest rates
could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated
maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):
lDue within one year $ 1,230.4 1
Due between one and two years 1,322.9
lDue between two and three years 782.9 1
Due after three years 7 413.8 7
1 Total is 3,750.0 l
A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 2, 2016. The analysis is based on an
estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield
curve of various magnitudes.
The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming
immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of
December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 (dollars in millions):
Fair Value

Senior Notes
As of December 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.90 billion. In June 2014, we entered into
interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a ﬂoating interest rate based on the LIB OR
plus a ﬁxed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to ﬂuctuations in market interest rates
is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest
rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.
As of December 2, 2016, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.90 billion and the related fair value based on
observable market prices in less active markets was $1.97 billion.
Other Market Risk
Privately Held Long-Term Investments
The privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are
inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may
never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of
privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure
regulations as US. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy
of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies
as these investments were insignificant as of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015.
