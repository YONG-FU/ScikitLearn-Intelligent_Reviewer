Our fixed income available-for—sale debt securities consist of high quality, investment grade securities from diverse issuers
with a minimum credit rating of BBB- and a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing
from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that
model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash ﬂow
methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields,
interest rates and US. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level
2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate
fair values are recorded.
