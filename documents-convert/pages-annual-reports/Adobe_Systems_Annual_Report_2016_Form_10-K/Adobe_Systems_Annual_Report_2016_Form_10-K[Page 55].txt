Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed
in Part I, Item 1A titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our
existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash ﬂows from operations and our available credit facility
will be suﬁicient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.
On March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Credit
Agreement”), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit
Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into
an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the
syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 2, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under
this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.
As of December 2, 2016, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of
4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together
with the 2020 Notes, the “Notes”).
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform
company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. See
Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition.
Our short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities
and US. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.We use professional
investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average,
61% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2016.
Stock Repurchase Program
To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock
issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the
ﬁrst quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved our stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up
to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.
During ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial
institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.08 billion, $625 million and $600 million, respectively.
The prepayments of $ 1 .08 billion made during fiscal 2016 were under the current $2 billion authority. Of the prepayments of $625
million made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the current $2 billion authority and $200 million were under the previous
$2 billion authority. The prepayments of $600 million made during fiscal 2014 were under the previous $2 billion authority. We
enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted
Average Price (“VWAP”) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the
discount that we receive is higher than the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There
were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement
for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.
The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used
to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the
contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon
discount. During ﬁscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price of $97. 16 through structured
repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During ﬁscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1
million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal
2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price per share of $63.48 through
structured repurchase agreements entered into during ﬁscal 2014 and fiscal 2013.
For fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at
the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 2, 2016, November 27, 2015 and November 28,
2014 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 2, 2016, $100. 1 million of prepayments remained
under the agreement.
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, as part of our current $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured
stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million.
This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200 million stock
repurchase agreement, $300 million remains under our current authority.
