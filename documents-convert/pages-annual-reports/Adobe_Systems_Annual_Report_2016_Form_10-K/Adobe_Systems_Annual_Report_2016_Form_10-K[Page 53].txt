Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating
expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation
in the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of employee options. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program,
which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.
Cash F lows ﬁom Operating Activities
For fiscal 2O 16, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative
Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the
increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working
capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes
payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased
primarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due
to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.
For fiscal 2O 15, net cash provided by operating activities of $ 1 .47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred
revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions
for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud oﬁerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase
in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily
due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The
primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.
For fiscal 2O 14, net cash provided by operating activities of $ 1 .29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the
net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred
revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity
for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted
services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we
discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee
transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.
