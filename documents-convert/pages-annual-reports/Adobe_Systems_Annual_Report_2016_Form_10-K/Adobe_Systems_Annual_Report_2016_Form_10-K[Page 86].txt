The deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2016 and 2015 include amounts related to various acquisitions. The total
change in deferred tax assets and liabilities includes changes that are recorded to other comprehensive income, additional paid-
in capital, goodwill, unrecognized tax benefits and retained earnings.
We provide US. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries’ earnings are considered
permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently
reinvested are repatriated, the related US. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of
December 2, 2016, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which US. income taxes have not been provided is approximately
$4.2 billion. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $1.1 billion.
As of December 2, 2016, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $83.5 million for federal and $36.4
million for state. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $70.6 million and $17.4 million,
respectively. The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2017 through 2035 .
The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits
are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be fully realized.
In addition, we have been tracking certain deferred tax attributes of approximately $55.3 million which have not been
recorded in the financial statements pursuant to accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. Pursuant to these
standards, the benefit of these deferred tax assets is not recorded to equity unless it reduces taxes payable.
As of December 2, 2016, a valuation allowance of $24.3 million has been established for certain deferred tax assets related
to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2016, the total change in the valuation allowance
was immaterial.
