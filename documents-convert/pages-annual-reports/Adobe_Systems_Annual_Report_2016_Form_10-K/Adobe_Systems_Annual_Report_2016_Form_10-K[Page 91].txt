Summary of Stock Options
As of December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015, we had 0.6 million and 1.3 million stock options outstanding, respectively.
Grants to Executive Ofﬁcers
All equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Grants to Non-Employee Directors
Although the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee
directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors since fiscal 2014. The initial equity
grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million based on the
average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100% on the day preceding the
next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual
meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled.
Annual equity grants to non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units shall have an aggregate value of $0.3
million as based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100%
on the day preceding the next annual meeting.
Restricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in thousands):
7 2016 7 7 2015 7 7 2014 7
Restricted stock units granted to existing directors 25 41 48 1
Compensation Costs
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is
based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.
We recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period of the entire award. The fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 awards are earned upon achievement of an
objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three—year performance period, as described above.
We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards
that are expected to vest.
As of December 2, 2016, there was $476.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures,
related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Total unrecognized
compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.
