ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters sit. We own the East and West
Tower buildings, lease the Almaden Tower building, and own the land under each of them. We also own the building and land in
Lehi, Utah, at 601 and 625 Townsend Street in San Francisco, California, and the data center in Hillsboro, Oregon. Outside of the
United States, we own certain land and buildings we occupy in Bangalore, India and Noida, India. We lease or sublease the rest
of the properties we occupy. All leased properties are leased under operating leases. Such leases expire at various times through
2031, with the exception of our land lease in Noida, India that expires in 2091. The annual base rent expense (including operating
expenses, property taxes and assessments, as applicable) for all leased facilities is currently approximately $88.5 million and is
subject to annual adjustments as well as changes in interest rates.
