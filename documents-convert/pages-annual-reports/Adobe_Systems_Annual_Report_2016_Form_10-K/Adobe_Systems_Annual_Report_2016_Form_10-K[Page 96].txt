future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director
and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We
believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.
Legal Proceedings
In connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including
patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation.
Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the
attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past
litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes
could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent
us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products
or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification
commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.
In addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary
course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal
proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a
quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably
possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue
for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our
independent registered public accounting firm.
We make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can
be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reﬂect the impacts of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise
specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim
against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be
incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is
immaterial.
All legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we
believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our
consolidated financial position, cash ﬂows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of
one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.
In connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software
Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims
alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-
claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash ﬂows or results of operations could be negatively
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.
