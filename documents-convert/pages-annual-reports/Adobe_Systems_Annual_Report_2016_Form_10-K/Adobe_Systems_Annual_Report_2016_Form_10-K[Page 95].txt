NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
The lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable
related to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of $80.4 million, which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 2, 2016, the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower
approximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the building at any time
during the lease term for $103 .6 million. If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against
the purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is $89.4 million.
The Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor
quarterly. As of December 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may demand
we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. If we
choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an
unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance,
up to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable. The Almaden Tower lease qualiﬁes for operating
lease accounting treatment and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.

Royalties
We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a
dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of revenue
on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $79.8 million, $62.3 million and $45.2 million in fiscal 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual
property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims
by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not
been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future
results of operations.
To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification
period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of
