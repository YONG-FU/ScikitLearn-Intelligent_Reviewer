NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, as part of our current $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured
stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $200 million.
This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $200 million stock
repurchase agreement, $300 million remains under our current authority.
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority
to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by
our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.
NOTE 13. NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period,
excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units,
performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in
thousands, except per share data):

Diluted net income per share $ 2.32 $ 1.24 $ 0.53
For fiscal 2016 and 2015, there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the
average fair market value of our stock of $96.39 and $79.22, respectively, that would have been anti-dilutive.
For fiscal 2014, options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value
of our stock of $65 .93 were not included in the calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The number of shares
of common stock under these options was immaterial.
NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire
at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and
variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was
approximately $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015, and $111.1 million in fiscal 2014. Our sublease income was immaterial
for all periods presented.
We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these
