Fiscal 2 01 6 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2015 Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by
increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.
Revenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetual creative and stock photography
offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated
with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions,
and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography
Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative
offerings. Increases associated with our creative oﬁerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our
perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared
to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offering. Decreases
were partially oﬁset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription oﬁerings as we continue to migrate
more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.
Digital Marketing
Revenue from Digital Marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to
continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe
Marketing Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, increases
in revenue associated with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Campaign.
Fiscal 2015 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2014 Revenue
Digital Media
Revenue from Digital Media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by
increases in revenue associated with our creative oﬁerings due to the strong adoption of Creative Cloud. Document Cloud revenue
remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
Creative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as
compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven
by the increase in the number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. Increases associated with our
creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative oﬁerings.
Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to
the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with Adobe Sign and our Document Cloud subscription offerings were
offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud
subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs.
