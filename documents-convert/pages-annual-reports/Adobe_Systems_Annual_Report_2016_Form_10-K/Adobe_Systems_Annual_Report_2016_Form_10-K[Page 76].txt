We review our debt and marketable equity securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate
whether or not any security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We consider factors such as the length
of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the
investment’s amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other-than—temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write
down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded
to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded
to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reﬂected as a separate component of stockholders” equity in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2016, we recorded immaterial other-than-temporary impairment losses
associated with certain of our fixed income securities and wrote down the securities to fair value. During fiscal 2015 and 2014,
we did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
