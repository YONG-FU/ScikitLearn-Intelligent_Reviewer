ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not
been presented for any of our fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was
not material.
T ubeMogul
Subsequent to December 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform
company, for approximately $549 million in cash consideration, as well as the assumption of certain employee equity awards. The
initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition
date and the issuance of these financial statements. TubeMogul will be integrated into our Digital Marketing reportable segment
for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
NOTE 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify
all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as “available-for—sale.” In general, these investments are free of trading
restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information.
Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reﬂected as
a separate component of stockholders” equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized
in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has
occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using
the specific identification method.
