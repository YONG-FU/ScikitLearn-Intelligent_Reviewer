Hybrid cloud, including vCAN and vCloud Air, and our SaaS offerings, including our AirWatch mobile solutions, increased to approximately 8% of our total
revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 from greater than 6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. vCAN revenue is generally included in license
revenue, and SaaS revenue, including vCloud Air and our AirWatch mobile solutions, is included in both license and services revenue.
License revenue relating to the sale of perpetual licenses that are part of a multi—year arrangement is generally recognized upon delivery of the underlying
license, whereas revenue derived from our hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings is recognized based on consumption or over a period of time.
License Revenue
License revenue growth in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely driven by license sales of NSX, vSAN and AirWatch mobile solutions, as well as growth in our
vCAN offering. We experienced stronger than expected sales of our compute products, which also contributed to the license revenue growth in 2016 compared to
2015. Strength in sales of our compute products were, in part, due to strong renewals of our EAs. We expect compute license sales to decline in 2017 and over the
longer-term.
License revenue increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of increased sales of our emerging product offerings, including NSX, AirWatch
mobile solutions and vSphere with Operations Management (“vSOM”), as well as revenue from our hybrid cloud offerings. License revenue during 2015 also
beneﬁted from declines in unearned license revenue.
In 2015, our license revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by certain factors including lower license sales of our core compute products, changes in the
value of the US. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we invoice and an increase in the percentage of sales derived from our hybrid cloud and SaaS
offerings. Increased sales of our hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings resulted in less revenue being recognized up-front, which also had an adverse impact on our
growth rate during 2015.
