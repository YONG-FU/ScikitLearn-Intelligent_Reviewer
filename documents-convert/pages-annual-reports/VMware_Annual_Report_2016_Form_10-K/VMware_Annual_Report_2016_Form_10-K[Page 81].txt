VMware, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
against, among others, EMC and four directors who serve on both the EMC board and the VMware board, setting forth similar allegations to those in the Ford
matter. The Jacobs matter settled in December 2016 for an immaterial amount. While VMware does not believe that the Ford case represents material adverse
exposures, no assurances can be given that the litigation will not have any adverse consequences for the company or the directors named in the suits.
During 2015, VMware reached an agreement with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the General Services Administration (“GSA”) to pay $76 million to
resolve allegations that VMware's government sales practices between 2006 and 2013 had violated the federal False Claims Act. The settlement was paid and
recorded as a reduction of VMware's total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.
VMware accrues for a liability when a determination has been made that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If
only a range can be estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, an accrual is recorded for the minimum amount in the
range. Significant judgment is required in both the determination that the occurrence of a loss is probable and is reasonably estimable. In making such judgments,
VMware considers the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Legal
costs are generally recognized as expense when incurred.
VMware is also subject to other legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations in the ordinary course of business or in
connection with business mergers and acquisitions, including claims with respect to commercial, contracting and sales practices, product liability, intellectual
property, employment, corporate and securities law, class action, whistleblower and other matters. From time to time, VMware also receives inquiries from and has
discussions with government entities and stockholders on various matters. As of December 31, 2016 , amounts accrued relating to these other matters arising as
part of the ordinary course of business were considered immaterial. VMware does not believe that any liability from any reasonably foreseeable disposition of such
claims and litigation, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

(1) Amounts in the table above exclude expected sublease income.
(2) Consisting of various contractual agreements, which include commitments on the lease for VMware’s Washington data center facility and asset retirement
obligations.
The amount of the future lease commitments after 2021 is primarily for the ground leases on VMware’s Palo Alto, California headquarter facilities, which
expire in 2046 . As several of VMware’s operating leases are payable in foreign currencies, the operating lease payments may ﬂuctuate in response to changes in
the exchange rate between the US dollar and the foreign currencies in which the commitments are payable.
In addition to the amounts above, $1,500 million of notes payable to Dell was outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and reﬂected on the consolidated balance
sheets. VMware also had an obligation as of December 31, 2016 to purchase $125 million of VMware Class A common stock under a stock purchase agreement
with Dell, which was settled during February 2017. Refer to Note B for further information regarding the notes payable to Dell and the stock purchase agreement
with Dell.
