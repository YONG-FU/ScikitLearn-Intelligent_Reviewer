NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Awards under the 2007 Plan may be in the form of stock-based awards, such as restricted stock units, or stock options. VMware’s Compensation and
Corporate Governance Committee determines the vesting schedule for all equity awards. Generally, restricted stock grants made under the 2007 Plan have a three -
year to four -year period over which they vest and vest 25% the first year and semi-annually thereafter. The exercise price for a stock option awarded under the
2007 Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of VMware Class A common stock on the date of grant. Most options granted under the 2007 Plan
vest 25% after the first year and monthly thereafter over the following three years and expire between six and seven years from the date of grant. VMware utilizes
both authorized and unissued shares to satisfy all shares issued under the 2007 Plan. At December 31, 2016 , there were an aggregate of 12.8 million shares of
common stock available for issuance pursuant to future grants under the 2007 Plan.
VMware Stock Repurchases
During January 2017, VMware’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,200 million of VMware’s Class A common stock through the end of
ﬁscal 2018. Stock will be purchased from time to time, in the open market or through private transactions, subject to market conditions. The timing of any
repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including VMware’s stock price, cash requirements for operations and
business combinations, corporate, legal and regulatory requirements and other market and economic conditions. VMware is not obligated to purchase any shares
under its stock repurchase programs. Purchases can be discontinued at any time VMware believes additional purchases are not warranted. All shares repurchased
under VMware’s stock repurchase programs are retired.

total of $500 million was paid in exchange for 6.2 million shares. The aggregate number of shares purchased was determined based upon the volume-weighted
average priced during a deﬁned period, less an agreed upon discount. Refer to Note B for further information.

stock price on the date of grant. The shares underlying the RSU awards are not issued until the RSUs vest. Upon vesting, each RSU converts into one share of
VMware Class A common stock.
