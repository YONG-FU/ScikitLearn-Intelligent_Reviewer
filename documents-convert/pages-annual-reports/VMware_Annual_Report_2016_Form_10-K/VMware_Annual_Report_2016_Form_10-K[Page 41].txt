General and administrative expenses include personnel and related overhead costs to support the business. These expenses include the costs associated with
ﬁnance, human resources, IT infrastructure and legal, as well as expenses related to corporate costs and initiatives, including charitable donations.

General and administrative expenses decreased in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in installment payments to certain
key employees of AirWatch that were subject to the achievement of specified employment conditions. The final installment payment to key employees of
AirWatch occurred during the first quarter of 20 16. As a result, compensation expense relating to these installment payments decreased by $132 million in 2016.
These decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in equipment, depreciation and facilities-related costs of
$36 million. In addition, cash—based employee-related expenses increased by $32 million, driven by incremental growth in headcount and salaries, and stock-based
compensation increased by $17 million, primarily due to an increase in restricted stock awards granted.
General and administrative expenses increased in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in equipment, depreciation and
facilities-related costs of $37 million and an increase in cash-based employee-related expenses of $30 million, due to incremental growth in headcount. In addition,
professional services-related costs increased $18 million. We also made installment payments to certain key employees of AirWatch that had been subject to the
achievement of speciﬁed future employment conditions. We recognized compensation expense of $145 million during 2015 relating to these installment payments.
The increase to general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $13 million resulting from ﬂuctuations in the exchange rates for foreign
currencies in which we incur expenses.
