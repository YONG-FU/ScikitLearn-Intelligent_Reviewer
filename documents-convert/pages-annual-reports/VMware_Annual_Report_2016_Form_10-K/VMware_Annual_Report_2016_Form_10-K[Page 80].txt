J. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
Former employee Dane Smith filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging (i) wrongful retaliation in violation of the False Claims Act and (ii) wrongful
termination in violation of public policy. The parties completed an arbitration hearing on January 23, 2017, but no decision has yet been issued by the arbitrator.
VMware believes that it has meritorious defenses relating to these claims, and currently a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.
On March 27, 2015, Phoenix Technologies (“Phoenix”) filed a complaint against VMware in the US District Court for the Northern District of California
asserting claims for copyright infringement and breach of contract relating to a version of Phoenix’s BIOS software that VMware licensed from Phoenix. In the
lawsuit, Phoenix is seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages. On January 6, 2017, the court granted VMware’s motion for summary judgment on the
contract statute of limitations issues, which removed Phoenix’s breach of contract claim from the lawsuit. No other claims were removed from the lawsuit on
summary judgment and trial is currently scheduled to start on May 30, 2017. VMware believes that it has meritorious defenses in connection with this lawsuit, and
currently a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.
On March 4, 2015, Christoph Hellwig, a software developer who alleges that software code he wrote is used in a component of the Company’s vSphere
product, filed a lawsuit against VMware in the Hamburg Regional Court in Germany alleging copyright infringement for failing to comply with the terms of an
open source General Public License v.2 (“GPL V2”) and seeking an order requiring VMware to comply with the GPL v.2 or cease distribution of any affected code
within Germany. On July 8, 2016, the German court issued a written decision dismissing Mr. Hellwig’s lawsuit because he failed to show that his protectable
software code had been used in VMware’s product. Mr. Hellwig has appealed the Regional Court’s decision and has filed his opening appellate brief and VMware
has filed its responsive appellate brief. No further brieﬁng or hearing schedule has yet been set by the appellate court.
While VMware believes that it has valid defenses against each of the above legal matters, given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, an unfavorable
resolution of one or more legal proceedings, claims, or investigations could have a material adverse effect on VMware’s consolidated financial statements.
On November 17, 2015, Francis M. Ford, a VMware Class A stockholder, filed an action in the Delaware Chancery Court against certain current and former
VMware directors, among others, alleging that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Dell Acquisition, and the proposed issuance of
tracking stock that is intended to track the performance of VMware. The plaintiff does not assert claims directly against VMware, but purports to bring class claims
on behalf of other VMware Class A stockholders and derivative claims on behalf of VMware. The Ford matter is currently in the motion to dismiss stage; the
hearing on these motions took place on February 3, 2017, but the court has not yet issued an order. In addition, on November 10, 2015, David Jacobs, also a
VMware stockholder, filed an action in Massachusetts Superior Court
