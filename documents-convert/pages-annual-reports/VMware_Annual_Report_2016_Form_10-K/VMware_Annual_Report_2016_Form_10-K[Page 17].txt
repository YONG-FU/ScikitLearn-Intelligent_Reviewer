° our ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be
disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;
0 defects and security vulnerabilities could be exploited or introduced into our software products or our hybrid cloud and SaaS offerings, thereby damaging
the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and services and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to
further data loss and cyber incidents; and
0 personally identifiable or conﬁdential data of our customers, employees and business partners could be stolen or lost.
Should any of the above events occur, we could be subject to signiﬁcant claims for liability from our customers, we could face regulatory actions from
governmental agencies, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised, our reputation and competitive position could be materially
harmed and we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our business, ﬁnancial condition
and operating results could be adversely affected.
Our operating results may ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly.
Our operating results may ﬂuctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a
period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. In addition, a significant
portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last two weeks of the quarter, which generally reﬂects customer buying patterns for enterprise technology.
As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors
or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline substantially.
Factors that may cause ﬂuctuations in our operating results include, among others, the factors described elsewhere in this risk factors section and the
following:
- ﬂuctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles (which have been increasing in length) and pricing levels for our products and services;
0 changes in customers” budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of their purchasing decisions;
0 the timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter, which can be affected by a number of factors, including product announcements, beta programs
and product promotions that can cause revenue recognition of certain orders to be deferred until future products to which customers are entitled become
available;
0 the timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by us or by our competitors;
0 the timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;
° our ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulﬁllment, product delivery, purchasing, billing and general
accounting, among other functions;
° our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;
0 credit risks of our distributors, who account for a signiﬁcant portion of product revenue and accounts receivable;
° our ability to process sales at the end of quarter;
0 seasonal factors such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by our customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;
0 renewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for EAs as original EA terms expire;
0 the timing and amount of internally developed software development costs that may be capitalized;
- unplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of our products and solutions;
° our ability to accurately predict the degree to which customers will elect to purchase our subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to our on-
premises offerings; and
° to the extent that we buy back shares of our common stock in private transactions with Dell or other third parties through arrangements that are accounted
for as derivative instruments, ﬂuctuations in our stock price during the pricing reference periods of such arrangements may result in gains or losses in our
quarterly earnings.
We are exposed to foreign exchange risks.
Because we conduct business in currencies other than the US. dollar but report our operating results in US. dollars, we face exposure to ﬂuctuations in
currency exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2016 , approximately 30% of our
