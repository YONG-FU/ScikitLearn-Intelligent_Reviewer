Cost of services revenue increased in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth in cash-based employee-related expenses of
$69 million, driven by incremental growth in headcount and salaries. In addition, stock-based compensation increased by $8 million, primarily driven by an
increase in restricted stock awards granted.
Cost of services revenue increased in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to growth in cash-based employee-related expenses of
$96 million, driven by incremental growth in headcount, and an increase in equipment, depreciation and facilities-related costs of $42 million. Additionally, third-
party professional services costs increased $23 million due to an increase in demand for technical support and services. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease in cost of services revenue of $47 million resulting from ﬂuctuations in the exchange rates for foreign currencies in which we incur expenses.
