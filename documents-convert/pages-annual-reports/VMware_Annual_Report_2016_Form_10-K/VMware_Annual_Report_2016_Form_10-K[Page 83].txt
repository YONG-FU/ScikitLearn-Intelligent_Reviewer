L. Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following (table in millions):
December 31,
2016 2015
’Unearned license revenue $ 503 $ 428 ‘
Unearned software maintenance revenue 4,628 4,174
lUnearned professional services revenue 493 _ 474 l
Total unearned revenue $ 5,624 $ 5,076
Unearned license revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of existing or future products or services, or is otherwise recognized ratably over the term of
the arrangement. Future products include, in some cases, emerging products that are offered as part of product promotions where the purchaser of an existing
product is entitled to receive the future product at no additional charge. To the extent the future product has not been delivered and VSOE of fair value cannot be
established, the revenue for the entire order is deferred until such time as all product delivery obligations have been fulﬁlled. In the event the arrangement does not
include professional services, unearned license revenue may also be recognized ratably, if the customer is granted the right to receive unspecified future products
or VSOE of fair value on the software maintenance element of the arrangement does not exist.
Unearned software maintenance revenue is attributable to VMware’s maintenance contracts and is generally recognized ratably over the contract period. The
weighted-average remaining term at December 31, 2016 was approximately two years . Unearned professional services revenue results primarily from prepaid
professional services, including training, and is generally recognized as the services are delivered.
Unearned license and software maintenance revenue will ﬂuctuate based upon a variety of factors including sales volume, the timing of both product
promotion offers and delivery of the future products offered, and the amount of arrangements sold with ratable revenue recognition. Additionally, the amount of
unearned revenue derived from transactions denominated in a foreign currency is impacted by ﬂuctuations in the foreign currencies in which VMware invoices.
