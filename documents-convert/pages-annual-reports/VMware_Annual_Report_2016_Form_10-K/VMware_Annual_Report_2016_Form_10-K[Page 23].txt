In June 2015, we reached an agreement with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the General Services Administration (“GSA”) to pay $76 million to resolve
allegations that our government sales practices between 2006 and 2013 had violated the federal False Claims Act. As set forth in the settlement agreement,
VMware denied the allegations and did not admit liability. A failure in the future to comply with federal and state governmental contracting requirements could
result in the termination of customer contracts, our suspension from government work, the imposition of ﬁnes or other government sanctions or an inability to
compete for new contracts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or ﬁnancial condition.
Acquisitions and dispositions could harm our business and operating results.
We have acquired in the past, and plan to acquire in the future, other businesses, products or technologies, and from time to time we dispose of businesses,
products and technologies. These transactions involve significant risks and uncertainties, which include:
0 disrupting our ongoing operations, diverting management from day-to-day responsibilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our
business, ﬁnancial condition and operating results;
0 failure of an acquired business to further our business strategy;
0 uncertainties in achieving the expected benefits of an acquisition or disposition, including enhanced revenue, technology, human resources, cost savings,
Operating efficiencies and other synergies;
° reducing cash available for operations, stock repurchase programs and other uses and resulting in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the
incurrence of debt;
- incurring amortization expense related to identifiable intangible assets acquired that could impact our operating results;
- difﬁculty integrating the operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel of acquired businesses effectively;
0 the need to provide transition services in connection with a disposition, which may result in the diversion of resources and focus;
0 difﬁculty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar
distribution partners or vendors;
- retaining and motivating key personnel from acquired companies;
0 declining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of businesses that we acquire or dispose of, which may result from changes in
compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed business;
° assuming the liabilities of an acquired business, including acquired litigation-related liabilities and regulatory compliance issues, and potential litigation
or regulatory action arising from a proposed or completed acquisition;
- lawsuits resulting from an acquisition or disposition;
- maintaining good relationships with customers or business partners of an acquired business or our own customers as a result of any integration of
operations or the divestiture of a business upon which our customers rely;
- unidentiﬁed issues not discovered during the diligence process, including issues with the acquired business’s intellectual property, product quality,
security, privacy practices, accounting practices, regulatory compliance or legal contingencies;
- maintaining or establishing acceptable standards, controls, procedures or policies with respect to an acquired business;
- risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction; and
0 the need to later divest acquired assets at a loss if an acquisition does not meet our expectations.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a signiﬁcant charge to earnings.
We may not realize all the economic benefit from our acquisitions of other companies, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. As of
December 31, 2016 , goodwill and amortizable intangible assets were $4,032 million and $517 million , respectively. We review our goodwill and amortizable
intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at
least annually. Factors that may lead to impairment include a substantial decline in stock price and market capitalization or cash ﬂows, reduced future cash ﬂow
estimates related to the assets and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant
