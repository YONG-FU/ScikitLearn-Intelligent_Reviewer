D. Realignment
On January 22, 2016, VMware approved a plan to streamline its operations, with plans to reinvest the associated savings in ﬁeld, technical and support
resources associated with growth products. As a result of these actions, approximately 800 positions were eliminated during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
VMware recognized $50 million of severance-related realignment expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 on the consolidated statements of income.
Additionally, VMware consolidated certain facilities as part of this plan, which resulted in the recognition of $2 million of related expenses during the year ended
December 31, 2016 on the consolidated statements of income. Actions associated with this plan were substantially completed by December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2015 , VMware eliminated approximately 380 positions across all major functional groups and geographies to
streamline its operations. As a result of these actions, $23 million of realignment expenses were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 on the
consolidated statements of income.
During the year ended December 31, 2014 , VMware eliminated approximately 180 positions across all major functional groups and geographies to
streamline its operations. As a result of these actions, $16 million of severance-related realignment expenses were recognized during the year ended December 31,
2014 on the consolidated statements of income.
The following table summarizes the activity for the accrued realignment expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (tables in millions):

E. Net Income per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and potentially dilutive securities
outstanding during the period, as calculated using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities primarily include unvested restricted stock units,
including performance stock units, stock options, including purchase options under VMware’s employee stock purchase plan. Securities are excluded from the
computations of diluted net income per share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. VMware uses the two-class method to calculate net income per share as both
classes share the same rights in dividends, therefore basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for both classes.
