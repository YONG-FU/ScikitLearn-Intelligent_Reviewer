NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences resulting from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reversed. Significant deferred tax assets and
liabilities consisted of the following (table in millions):

VMware has US federal net operating loss carryforwards of $91 million from acquisitions made since 2007 . These operating loss carryforwards expire at
different periods through 2035 . Portions of these carryforwards are subject to annual limitations. VMware expects to be able to fully utilize these net operating
losses against future income. VMware also has state net operating loss carryforwards of $131 million , resulting from acquisitions since 2007, expiring at different
periods through 2036 .
VMware has California research and development (“R&D”) credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of $113 million that can be carried over indefinitely.
VMware also has R&D credit carryforwards for Massachusetts and Georgia of approximately $7 million and $9 million , respectively, which expire at different
periods through 2031 . VMware has non-US. net operating losses of $16 million resulting from certain foreign operations and non-US. acquisitions in 2014 .
These net operating losses have various carryforward periods, including certain portions that can be carried over indefinitely.
VMware determined that the realization of deferred tax assets relating to portions of the state net operating loss carryforwards, state R&D tax credits, capital
losses, and certain non-US net operating losses did not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, and accordingly, a valuation allowance of $139 million was
recorded. If, in the future, new evidence supports the realization of the deferred tax assets related to these items, the valuation allowance will be reversed and a tax
benefit will be recorded accordingly.
VMware believes it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, will be realized in the foreseeable future as
VMware believes that it will generate sufficient taxable income in future years. VMware's ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future years in
appropriate tax jurisdictions will determine the amount of net deferred tax asset balances to be realized in future periods. During the years ended December 31,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the total change in the valuation allowance was $22 million and $38 million , respectively. The increases in the valuation allowance
were primarily due to the California R&D credits and capital losses generated in each respective year.
US income taxes have not been provided on certain undistributed earnings of non-US subsidiaries of approximately $5,354 million and $4,473 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, because such earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States, or will be remitted
substantially free of additional US. tax. VMware’s rate of taxation in non-U.S. jurisdictions is lower than the US. tax rate. VMware’s non-US. income is
primarily earned by VMware’s subsidiaries in Ireland, where the statutory tax rate is 12.5% . Recent developments in non-US. tax jurisdictions and unfavorable
changes in non-US tax laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on VMware’s annual effective tax rate in the future. All income earned abroad, except
for previously taxed income for US. tax purposes, is considered indefinitely
