Tax Sharing Agreement with Dell
On September 6, 2016, VMware entered into an amended tax sharing agreement with Dell, in connection with, and effective as of, the Dell Acquisition. The
amended tax sharing agreement amends and restates the tax sharing agreement dated August 13, 2007 between VMware and EMC. Key contractual terms of the
amended tax sharing agreement are substantially unchanged from the original agreement with EMC.
Although VMware’s results are included in the Dell consolidated return for US. federal income tax purposes, VMware’s income tax provision is calculated
primarily as though VMware were a separate taxpayer. However, certain transactions that VMware and Dell are parties to are assessed using consolidated tax
return rules.
VMware has made payments to Dell pursuant to the tax sharing agreement. The following table summarizes the payments made during the years ended
December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 (table in millions):

[Payments from VMware to Dell 3; 373 $ 144 $ 150 1
Payments from VMware to Dell under the tax sharing agreement relate to VMware’s estimated portion of federal income taxes on Dell’s consolidated tax
return as well as the state payments for combined states. The timing of the tax payments due to and from Dell is governed by the tax sharing agreement. The
amounts that VMware owes to Dell for the estimated portion of federal income taxes on Dell’s consolidated tax return differ from the amounts VMware would
owe on a separate return basis and the difference is presented as a component of stockholders’ equity. In the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the
difference between the amount of tax calculated on a separate return basis and the amount of tax calculated per the tax sharing agreement was recorded in
stockholders’ equity as an increase of $15 million and $13 million , and a decrease of $12 million , respectively.
As a result of the activity under the tax sharing agreement with Dell, amounts due to and from Dell, net as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the
following (table in millions):

VMware’s expected tax obligation includes two US. tax return periods in 2016 as a result of the Dell acquisition. Cash payments to Dell for taxes reﬂect
expected tax obligations for the tax return period prior to the Dell acquisition and the period from the date of the Dell acquisition through the end of Dell’s fiscal
year end. The $181 million asset shown in the table above was included in other current assets on VMware’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016.
