Fair Value of VMware Options
The fair value of each option to acquire VMware Class A common stock granted during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
For the Year Ended December 31,
VMware Stock Options 2016 2015 2014
’Dividend yield None None None 1
Expected volatility 31.9% 32.0% 36.2%
lRisk—free interest rate 0.9% 1.1% 09%
Expected term (in years) 3.1 3.3 3.2
’Weighted-average fair value at grant date 33 49.64 $ 27.16 $ 48.47 ‘
For the Year Ended December 31,

’Dividend yield None None None 1
Expected volatility 38.3% 30.1% 32.3%
lRisk—free interest rate 0.5% 0.1% 01%
Expected term (in years) 0.7 0.5 0.5
’Weighted-average fair value at grant date 33 13.57 $ 20.59 $ 20.71 ‘
The weighted-average grant date fair value of VMware stock options can ﬂuctuate from period to period primarily due to higher valued options assumed
through business combinations with exercise prices lower than the fair market value of VMware’s stock on the date of grant.
For equity awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , volatility was based on an analysis of historical stock prices and
implied volatilities of VMware’s Class A common stock. The expected term is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior, the term
of the option period for grants made under the ESPP, or the weighted-average remaining term for options assumed in acquisitions. VMware’s expected dividend
yield input was zero as it has not historically paid, nor expects in the future to pay, cash dividends on its common stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on a
US. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options.
