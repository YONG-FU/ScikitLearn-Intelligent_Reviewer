Of the net unrecognized tax beneﬁts, including interest and penalties, of $277 million as of December 31, 2016 , approximately $259 million would, if
recognized, benefit VMware's annual effective income tax rate. The $277 million of net unrecognized tax beneﬁts are included in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets. VMware includes interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision. VMware had accrued
$44 million and $34 million of interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax beneﬁts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Income tax
expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 included interest and penalties of $10 million , $13 million and $8 million , respectively,
associated with uncertain tax positions.
The Dell-owned EMC consolidated group is routinely under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). All US federal income tax matters have been
concluded for years through 2010 , except for any matters under appeal. The 2011 federal tax returns of the Dell-owned EMC consolidated group are currently
under audit by the IRS. In addition, we are under corporate income tax audits in various states and non-US jurisdictions. Consistent with our historical practices
under the tax sharing agreement with EMC, when we become subject to federal tax audits as a member of Dell’s consolidated group, the tax sharing agreement
provides that Dell has authority to control the audit and represent Dell’s and VMware’s interests to the IRS.
Open tax years subject to examinations for larger non-US jurisdictions vary beginning 2008 . Open tax years for Ireland, the largest non-US. jurisdiction,
begin 2O 10 . Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. When considering the outcomes and the timing of tax
examinations, the expiration of statutes of limitations for speciﬁc jurisdictions, or the timing and result of ruling requests from taxing authorities, it is reasonably
possible that total unrecognized tax benefits could be potentially reduced by approximately $8 million within the next 12 months.
N. Stockholders’ Equity
VMware Class B Common Stock Conversion Rights
Each share of Class B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common stock. If VMware’s Class B common stock is distributed to security
holders of Dell in a qualified distribution, the Class B shares will no longer be convertible into shares of Class A common stock unless a stockholder vote is
obtained after certain conditions are satisfied. Prior to any such distribution, all Class B shares automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock if Dell
transfers such shares to a third party that is not a successor or a Dell subsidiary or at such time as the number of shares of common stock owned by Dell or its
successor falls below 20% of the outstanding shares of VMware’s common stock. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 300.0 million shares of Class A common
stock were reserved for conversion.
VMware Equity Plan
In June 2007, VMware adopted its 2007 Equity and Incentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”). As of December 31, 2016 , the number of authorized shares under the
2007 Plan was 121.6 million . The number of shares underlying outstanding equity awards that VMware assumes in the course of business acquisitions are also
added to the 2007 Plan reserve on an as-converted basis. VMware has assumed 4.4 million shares, which accordingly have been added to authorized shares under
the 2007 Plan reserve.
