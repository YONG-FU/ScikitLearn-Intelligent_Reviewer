installment payments made to certain key employees of AirWatch, and increases in payroll and operating expenses resulting from growth in employee-related
expenses driven by growth in headcount.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities is generally attributable to the purchase of available-for-sale securities, business acquisitions and capital expenditures. Cash
provided by investing activities is impacted by the sales and maturities of our available-for-sale securities.
Cash used in investing activities increased $129 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by increased cash used for net purchases of our available-
for-sale securities. In addition, in 2015, we released $75 million from escrow related to payments made to certain employees of AirWatch, which was reﬂected as
an inﬂow within investing activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property and equipment additions of $ 1 80 million.
Cash used in investing activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of our acquisitions, including AirWatch for $1,068 million during
the ﬁrst quarter of 20 14. Additionally, the net cash used related to our available-for-sale securities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014.
The increase in restricted cash during 2014 included $75 million for amounts held in escrow and payable to certain AirWatch employees, subject to
achievement of certain employment conditions. During 2015, $75 million was released from escrow and paid to the employees. The release from escrow was
reﬂected as an inﬂow within investing activities while the payment to the employees was reﬂected as an outﬂow within operating activities.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities increased $478 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in our repurchase of our common stock.
Cash used in financing activities in 2015 changed compared to cash provided by financing activities in 2014 primarily as a result of the cash received in
connection with the notes payable exchange agreement with our Parent during 2014 and an increase in our repurchase of our common stock during 2015.
Notes Payable to Dell
As of December 31, 2016 , $1,500 million remained outstanding on notes payable to Dell, with interest payable quarterly in arrears.
In connection with our acquisition of AirWatch, we entered into a note exchange agreement with our Parent on January 21, 2014 providing for the issuance of
three promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million . The total debt of $1,500 million included $450 million that was exchanged for the
$450 million promissory note issued to our Parent in April 2007, as amended and restated in June 2011.
The three notes issued have the following principal amounts and maturity dates: $680 million due May 1, 2018 , $550 million due May 1, 2020 and
$270 million due December 1, 2022 .
The notes bear interest at the annual rate of 1.75% . Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The notes may be prepaid without penalty or premium. We drew
down on all three notes in late January 2014.
Sto ck Repurchase Program
From time to time, we repurchase stock pursuant to authorized stock repurchase programs in open market transactions as permitted by securities laws and
other legal requirements. We are not obligated to purchase any shares under our stock repurchase programs. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number
of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors, including our stock price, cash requirements for operations and business combinations, corporate and
regulatory requirements and other market and economic conditions. Purchases can be discontinued at any time we believe additional purchases are not warranted.
All shares repurchased under our stock repurchase programs are retired.
From time to time, we may also repurchase stock pursuant to authorized stock repurchase programs in private transactions. On December 15, 2016, we entered
into a stock purchase agreement with Dell to purchase $500 million of our Class A common stock. Through December 31, 2016 , we had purchased 4.8 million
shares for $375 million . On February 15, 2017, the stock purchase agreement with Dell was completed. A total of $500 million was paid in exchange for
6.2 million shares.
During January 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,200 million of VMware’s Class A common stock through the end of ﬁscal
2018. This authorization was in addition to the stock purchase agreement with Dell. Refer to Note N to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
