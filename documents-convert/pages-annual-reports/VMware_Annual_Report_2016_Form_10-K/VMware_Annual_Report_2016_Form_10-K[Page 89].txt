VMware, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
VMware’s restricted stock also includes performance stock unit (“PSU”) awards, which have been granted to certain VMware executives and employees. The
PSU awards include performance conditions and, in certain cases, a time-based vesting component. Upon vesting, each PSU award will convert into VMware’s
Class A common stock at various ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 shares per PSU, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated
by each individual award. If minimum performance thresholds are not achieved, then no shares will be issued. As of December 31, 2016 , the number of PSUs
outstanding includes certain PSUs for which performance conditions have concluded but time-based vesting is still required.

VMware Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In June 2007, VMware adopted its 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which is intended to be qualified under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2016 , the number of authorized shares under the ESPP was a total of 14.3 million shares. Under the ESPP, eligible VMware
employees are granted options to purchase shares at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value at
the time of exercise. The option period is generally twelve months and includes two embedded six-month option periods. Options are exercised at the end of each
embedded option period. If the fair market value of the stock is lower on the first day of the second embedded option period than it was at the time of grant, then
the twelve-month option period expires and each enrolled participant is granted a new twelve-month option. As of December 31, 2016 , 2.1 million shares of
VMware Class A common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.
