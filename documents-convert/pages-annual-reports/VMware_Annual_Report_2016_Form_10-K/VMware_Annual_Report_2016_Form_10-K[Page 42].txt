Investment Income
Investment income during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was as follows (dollars in millions):
For the Year Ended December 31, 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014
2016 2015 2014 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change
[Investment income as 77 s 49 s 38 s 28 57% $ 11 28% l
% of Total revenue 1 % 1% 1%
Investment income increased in 2016 compared to 2015 and 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of increased interest income earned on our short-
term investments resulting from both higher yields and higher invested balances, partially offset by the amortization of premiums.
Income Tax Provision
Our annual effective income tax rate was 19.5% , 17.8% and 15.5% during the years ended 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Our effective income tax rate
in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily as a result of a shift in mix of earnings from our lower tax non-US. jurisdictions to the United States. This impact from
the shift in mix of earnings was partially offset by the favorable impact of lower unrecognized tax benefit additions recorded in 2016 compared to 2015. Our
annual effective tax rate in 2015 was higher than in 2014 primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings from lower tax non-US. jurisdictions to the United States, a
reduction in the benefit from the federal research tax credit and the net increase in unrecognized tax benefits.
Our rate of taxation in non-US. jurisdictions is lower than our US. tax rate. Our non-U.S. earnings are primarily earned by our subsidiaries organized in
Ireland, and as such, our annual effective tax rate can be significantly impacted by the composition of our earnings in the US. and non-US. jurisdictions.
All income earned in non-US. jurisdictions, except for previously taxed income for US. tax purposes, is considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign
operations and no tax provision for US. taxes has been recognized with respect to such income. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the undistributed earnings of
our non-US. subsidiaries were approximately $5,354 million and $4,473 million , respectively. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non-US. funds in our
foreign operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our US. operations. At this time, it is not practicable to estimate the
amount of tax that may be payable if we were to repatriate these earnings.
We have historically been included in EMC’s consolidated group for US. federal income tax purposes, and with the closing of the Dell Acquisition, we are
now included in Dell’s consolidated tax group. We will continue to be included in Dell’s consolidated group for periods in which Dell beneﬁcially owns at least
80% of the total voting power and value of our combined outstanding Class A and Class B common stock as calculated for US. federal income tax purposes. The
percentage of voting power and value calculated for US. federal income tax purposes may differ from the percentage of outstanding shares beneficially owned by
Dell due to the greater voting power of our Class B common stock as compared to our Class A common stock and other factors. Each member of a consolidated
group during any part of a consolidated return year is jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated return of such year and for any subsequently
determined deficiency thereon. Should Dell’s ownership fall below 80% of the total voting power or value of our outstanding stock in any period, then we would
no longer be included in the Dell consolidated group for US. federal income tax purposes, and our US. federal income tax would be reported separately from that
of the Dell consolidated group.
Although our results are included in the Dell consolidated return for US. federal income tax purposes, our income tax provision is calculated primarily as
though we were a separate taxpayer. However, certain transactions that we and Dell are parties to are assessed using consolidated tax return rules.
Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business, regulations, or rates, changing interpretation of
existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, the impact of accounting for business combinations and shifts in the amount
of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits.
Our Relationship with Dell
As of December 31, 2016 , Dell controlled 38 million shares of Class A common stock and all 300 million shares of Class B common stock, representing
82.8% of our total outstanding shares of common stock and 97.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. For a description of related
risks, refer to “Risks Related to Our Relationship with Dell and the Dell Acquisition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
