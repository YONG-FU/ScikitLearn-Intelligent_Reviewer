Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we held cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as follows (table in millions):

2016 2015
’Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,790 $ 2,493 ‘
Short-term investments 5,195 5,016
I Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 7,985 $ 7,509 1
We hold a diversiﬁed portfolio of money market funds, time deposits and ﬁxed income securities. Our fixed income securities are denominated in US. dollars
and primarily consist of highly liquid debt instruments of the US. Government and its agencies, municipal obligations, mortgage-backed securities and US. and
foreign corporate debt securities. We limit the amount of our investments with any single issuer and monitor the diversity of the portfolio and the amount of
investments held at any single financial institution, thereby diversifying our credit risk.
As of December 31, 2016 , our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the United States were $6,921 million . If these overseas funds
were needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on substantially all of the undistributed earnings to
repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our non-US. earnings in our foreign operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a
need to repatriate them to fund our US. Operations.
We expect that cash generated by operations will be our primary source of liquidity. We also believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any
cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. While we believe our existing cash
and cash equivalents and cash to be generated by operations will be sufﬁcient to meet our normal operating requirements, our overall level of cash needs may be
impacted by the number and size of acquisitions, investments and stock repurchases. Should we require additional liquidity, we may seek to arrange debt ﬁnancing
or enter into credit facilities.
Our cash ﬂows summarized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 were as follows (table in millions):

Operating A ctivities
Cash provided by operating activities increased $482 million in 2016 compared to 2015, driven primarily by increased cash collections due to growth in sales
during the year ended December 31, 2016 . Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in 2015 reﬂects payments for legal settlements, including
$76 million for the GSA settlement, and approximately $185 million of installment payments made to certain key employees of AirWatch. The final installment
payment of $29 million was made during the ﬁrst quarter of 20 16. Cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by increases in cash payments for
employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses and commissions, resulting primarily from incremental growth in headcount and salaries. Cash paid for
taxes under our tax sharing arrangement with Dell also increased from $144 million in 2015 to $373 million in 2016.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $281 million in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by changes in unearned revenue and accounts receivable.
While cash collections increased in 2015, they were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the US. dollar against the foreign currencies in which we invoice.
Additionally, cash provided by operating activities in 2015 reﬂects payments for legal settlements, primarily $76 million for the GSA settlement, approximately
