G. Fair Value Measurements
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. VMware determines fair value using the following hierarchy:
0 Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
0 Level 2 - Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in
markets that are noted active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities
0 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities
VMware’s ﬁxed income securities are primarily classiﬁed as Level 2, with the exception of some of the US. Government and agency obligations which are
classified as Level 1. Additionally, VMware’s Level 2 classiﬁcation includes forward contracts and notes payable to Dell. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 ,
VMware’s Level 2 securities were generally priced using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market
prices for similar instruments, or pricing models such as discounted cash ﬂow techniques.
VMware did not have any significant assets or liabilities that fell into Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and there have
been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
