and 2015. Amortization of intangibles also included $1.2 million each year related to intangible assets existing prior
to the 2007 Transactions.
We anticipate that the composition and amount of amortization associated with intangible assets as of December
31, 2016 will remain at $16.8 million in 2017, and will decrease to $16.3 million in 2018, of which $0.7 million will
represent the final amortization of the intangible assets existing prior to the 2007 Transactions. Amortization of
intangible assets is expected to be $15.6 million from 2019 through 2021. Actual amounts of amortization expense
may differ from estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, impairment of intangible assets,
accelerated amortization of intangible assets, and other events.

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, certain operations software related to the Company's logistics
business was determined to be fully impaired based on a significant decrease in the expected useful life of the
software. This resulted in a pre-tax impairment loss of $0.5 million. Also during the three months ended December
31, 2016, management reassessed the fair value of certain lELtractors, which had a total book value of $2.2 million,
determining that there was a pre-tax impairment loss of $0.3 million.

Gain on disposal of property and equipment is dependent upon the number of tractors and trailers that we have
available for trade or sale during the period, execution of those sales, the type of equipment we are selling, and the
used equipment market, among other things. The decrease in gain on disposal of property and equipment was
primarily driven by lower gain on disposals of tractors, due to a soft used truck market in 2016, compared to 2015.
This was partially offset by an increase in volume of trailers sold.
