Deadhead Miles Percentage (monitored daily) — This is calculated by dividing the number of unpaid miles by
the total number of miles driven. We monitor deadhead miles percentage in Truckload and Swift Refrigerated, as
we strive to reduce our number of deadhead miles within these segments. By balancing our freight flows and
planning consecutive loads with shorter distances between the drop-off and pick-up locations, we are able to reduce
the percentage of deadhead miles driven to allow for more revenue-generating miles during our drivers' hours-of-
service. This also enables us to reduce wage, fuel, and other costs associated with deadhead miles.
Average Operational Truck Count (monitored daily) —We use this measure for all of our reportable segments.
It includes tractors driven by company drivers as well as owner-operator units. This measure changes based on
our ability to adjust our fleet size in response to changes in demand.
Load Count and Average Container Count (monitored daily) — Within lntermodal, we monitor load count and
average container count. These metrics allow us to measure our utilization of our container fleet.
Adjusted Operating Ratio (monitored monthly) —We consider this ratio an important measure of our operating
profitability for each of our reportable segments. We define and reconcile Adjusted Operating Ratio under "Non-
GAAP Financial Measures," above. GAAP Operating Ratio is operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, or
the inverse of operating margin, and produces an indication of operating efficiency. It is widely used in our industry
as an assessment of management's effectiveness in controlling all categories of operating expenses.
The following tables are GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for each reportable segment's Adjusted Operating
Ratio:
