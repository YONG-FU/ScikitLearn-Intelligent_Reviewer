Operating supplies and expenses primarily consist of ordinary vehicle repairs and maintenance, costs associated
with preparing tractors and trailers for sale or trade-in, driver expenses, driver recruiting costs, legal and professional
services fees, general and administrative expenses, and other costs. Operating supplies and expenses are primarily
affected by the age of our company-owned fleet of tractors and trailers, the number of miles driven in a period, driver
turnover, and typically to a lesser extent by efficiency measures in our repair and maintenance shops.
The increase in operating supplies and expenses was affected by a $20.4 million increase in legal settlements and
reserves, which was primarily due to a $22.0 million accrual in 2016 related to unfavorable developments associated
with certain litigation within our Swift Refrigerated segment. In 2015, operating supplies and expenses included a
$5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related items within the non-reportable segments. The increase
in legal settlements and reserves was partially offset by a $17.2 million decrease in equipment maintenance costs.

Fuel expense consists primarily of diesel fuel expense for our company-owned tractors and fuel taxes. The primary
factors affecting our fuel expense are the cost of diesel fuel, the fuel economy of our equipment, and the number
of miles driven by company drivers.
We believe the most effective protections against fuel cost increases are maintaining a fuel-efficient fleet by
incorporating fuel efficiency measures into our business, such as aerodynamic equipment, slower tractor speeds,
engine idle limitations, and a reduction of deadhead miles; actively managing fuel procurement; and maintaining
an effective fuel surcharge program. To mitigate unrecovered fuel exposure, we have worked to negotiate more
robust surcharge programs with customers identified as having inadequate programs. We generally have not used
derivatives to hedge against higher fuel costs in the past, but continue to evaluate this possibility. To mitigate the
impact of rising fuel costs, we have contracted to purchase some fuel from certain fuel suppliers at a fixed price or
within banded pricing for a specific period, usually not exceeding twelve months.
The decrease in our fuel expense was the result of lower fuel prices and slightly improved fuel efficiency. During
2016, the average DOE index was $2.30, compared to 2015, which had an average DOE index of $2.71. As noted
above, miles driven by company drivers were relatively flat from 2015 to 2016.

Purchased transportation expense includes payments made to owner-operators, rail partners, and other third parties
for their services. The decrease in the expense was attributed to reduced fuel reimbursements to owner-operators,
as a result of lower fuel prices and a 2.9% decrease in miles driven by owner-operators. Additionally, lower intermodal
freight volumes resulted in a decrease in payments to rail carriers, further contributing to the decrease in the expense.
This was partially offset by the impact of increasing owner-operator contracted pay rates in May 2015.
