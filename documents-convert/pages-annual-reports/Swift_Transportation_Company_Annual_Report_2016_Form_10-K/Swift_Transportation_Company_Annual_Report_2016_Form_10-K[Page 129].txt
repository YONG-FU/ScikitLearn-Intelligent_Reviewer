The carrying amounts of the final instruments shown in the table are included in the consolidated balance sheets,
as follows:
(1) Restricted investments are included in "Restricted investments, held to maturity, amortized cost."
(2) The New Term Loan A is included in "Current portion of long-term debt" and "Long-term debt, less current
portion." Carrying value is net of $1.3 million and $1.7 million DLCs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
(3) Carrying value is net of $0.7 million and $1.1 million DLCs as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The estimated fair values of the financial instruments shown in the above table as of December 31 , 2016 and 2015,
represent management's best estimates of the amounts that would be received to sell those assets or that would
be paid to transfer those liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at that date. The estimated
fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there is little, if any,
market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the estimated fair value measurement reflects the
Company's ownjudgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Thesejudgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available under the circumstances.
The following summary presents a description of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instrument.
Restricted Investments — The estimated fair value of the Company's restricted investments is based on quoted
prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable.
Term Loans — The estimated fair value of the Term Loan A approximates the face value.
Securitization of Accounts Receivable — The Company's securitization of accounts receivable consists of
borrowings outstanding pursuant to the Company's 2015 RSA as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, as discussed
in Note 12. Its fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the
uncertainty involved.
Fair Value Hierarchy—ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US-
GAAP and expands financial statement disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC Topic 820 further
specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques, which is based on whether the inputs into the valuation technique are
observable or unobservable. The hierarchy follows:
0 Level 7— Valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are quoted prices from active markets for assets
or liabilities that are identical to the assets or liabilities being measured.
0 Level 2— Valuation techniques in which significant inputs include quoted prices from active markets for assets
or liabilities that are similar to the assets or liabilities being measured and/or quoted prices from markets that
