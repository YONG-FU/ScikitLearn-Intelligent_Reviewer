(5) Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These
non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to, or superior to, GAAP financial
measures. However, management believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides
useful information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations. Adjusted EPS, Adjusted
Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures
in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
