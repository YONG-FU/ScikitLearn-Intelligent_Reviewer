The effective tax rate in 2014 was 35.7%, which was lower than our expectation of 38.5%, primarily due to the
benefit of prior year federal income tax credits realized in the third quarter of 201 4 and federal employment income
tax credits realized in the fourth quarter of 2014.

while outstanding borrowings were $280.0 million, gross of DLCs.
(3) Restricted cash and cash equivalents, and restricted short-term investments are primarily held by our captive

Uses of Liquidity
Our business requires substantial amounts of cash for operating activities, including salaries and wages paid to our
employees, contract payments to owner-operators, insurance and claims payments, tax payments, and others. We
also use large amounts of cash and credit for the following activities:
0 Capital Expenditures— Whenjustified by customer demand, as well as our liquidity and our ability to generate
acceptable returns, we make substantial cash capital expenditures to maintain a modern company tractor fleet,
refresh our trailer fleet, and fund growth in our revenue equipment fleet. We expect the net cash capital
expenditures required to maintain our current fleet to be in the range of $250.0 million to $300.0 million annually,
but intend to keep this range as flexible as possible to appropriately respond to pending business opportunities
and the overall market environment. In addition to this, we expect to continue to obtain a portion of our equipment
under operating and capital leases. We believe we have ample flexibility with our trade cycle and purchase
agreements to alter our current plans if economic or other conditions warrant.
Over the long-term, we will continue to have significant capital requirements, which may require us to seek
additional borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital. The availability of financing or equity capital will depend
upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions. If such additional
borrowing, lease financing, or equity capital is not available at the time we need it, then we may need to borrow
more under the revolving credit facility (if not then fully drawn), extend the maturity of then-outstanding debt,
rely on alternative financing arrangements, or engage in asset sales.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to incur additional debt under our existing financial arrangements
to satisfy our ongoing capital requirements. However, we believe the combination of our expected cash flows,
financing available through operating leases, which are not subject to debt incurrence baskets, the capital lease
basket, available funds under the 2015 RSA, and availability under the New Revolver will be sufficient to fund
our expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.
