Results of Operations — Comparison Between the Years Ended December 37, 2016 and 2015
The $48.3 million decrease in net income from $197.6 million in 2015 to $149.3 million in 2016, reflects the following:
(1) $59.1 million decrease in Revenue xF SR — This was driven by decreases in the Truckload, Swift Refrigerated,
Intermodal, and non-reportable segments, partially offset by an increase in Revenue xFSR in the Dedicated
segment.
(2) $138.7 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue — Fuel prices were lower overall in 2016, which had an
average DOE index of $2.30, compared to $2.71 in 2015.
(3) $71.5 million decrease in fuel expense, primarily due to lower fuel prices.
(4) $63.7 million decrease in purchased transportation — The decrease in the expense was attributed to reduced
fuel reimbursements to owner-operators, as a result of lower fuel prices and a 2.9% decrease in miles driven
by owner-operators. Additionally, lower intermodal freight volumes resulted in a decrease in payments to rail
carriers, further contributing to the decrease in the expense. This was partially offset by the impact of increasing
owner-operator contracted pay rates in May 2015.
(5) $36.7 million increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits, which was primarily due to the driver wage
increase implemented in May 2015, an increase in group health insurance expenses, and a $7.1 million one-
time expense pertaining to Jerry Moyes' retirement package.
(6) $14.2 million decrease in gain on disposal of property and equipment, primarily driven by lower gain on disposals
of tractors, due to a soft used truck market in 2016, compared to 2015. This was partially offset by an increase
in volume of trailers sold.
(7) $9.6 million loss on debt extinguishment in 2015, resulting from the replacement of the 2014 Agreement with
the 2015 Agreement.
(8) $53.5 million decrease in income tax expense. The effective tax rate in 2016 was 30.6%, which was lower
than our expectation of 36.5%. The difference reflects reduced taxes primarily due to a reduction of income
before income taxes. Additionally, federal domestic production activities deductions, certain income tax credits
received by our foreign and domestic subsidiaries, and a reduction in our uncertain tax position reserve
contributed to the difference. See below for discussion related to the 2015 effective tax rate.
(9) $2.1 million decrease in other expenses was primarily due to the impacts from the Company's various cost
control initiatives implemented during 2016. This was partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in legal
settlements and reserves within operating supplies and expenses, which was primarily due to a $22.0 million
accrual in 2016 related to unfavorable developments associated with certain litigation within our Swift
Refrigerated segment.
