Factors Affecting Comparability Between Periods
Driver Wages and Owner-operator Pay Rates — We implemented increases in wages for our company drivers
and contracted pay rates for the owner-operators we contract with in August 2014 and May 2015. These
increases were tailored, and we believe successful, at improving driver retention and recruiting. However, the
increases had a short-term negative impact on profitability for certain periods discussed below, given the
immediate effect of driver wage and pay rate increases on expense, versus the more gradual effect of customer
pricing increases on revenue. We refer to these increases in company driver wages and owner-operator
contracted pay rates throughout the segment and operating expense reviews, below.
