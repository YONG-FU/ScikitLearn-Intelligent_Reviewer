Equity Compensation Plan Information
On March 28, 2014, the Board adopted the 2014 Stock Plan, which replaced the 2007 Stock Plan. The 2014 Stock
Plan became effective on May 8, 2014, upon approval by the Company's stockholders. After May 8, 2014, no new
awards were granted under the 2007 Stock Plan. The 2007 Stock Plan continues to govern all awards granted
under the 2007 Stock Plan until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, canceled, or have otherwise expired
or terminated.
The 2014 Stock Plan generally contains the same features, terms, and conditions as the 2007 Stock Plan.
Additionally, the 2014 Stock Plan did not increase the number of shares of stock available for grant, which means
that the number of shares available for grant under the 2014 Stock Plan reflected the number of authorized but
unissued (and not subject to outstanding awards) under the 2007 Stock Plan as of the date the 2014 Stock Plan
became effective. The material features of the Company's 2014 Stock Plan, as well as the 2012 ESPP, are described
in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K.
The following table represents securities authorized for issuance under the Company's stock plans at
December 31, 2016:

Column (a) includes 686,257 shares of our Class Acommon stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units and
performance units. Because there is no exercise price associated with such awards, such equity awards are not
included in the weighted-average exercise price calculation in column (b).
Columns (a) and (b) pertain to the Company's 2014 Stock Plan. No amounts related to the Company's 2012 ESPP
are included in columns (a) or (b). Column (c) includes 4,312,756 shares available for issuance under the Company's
2014 Stock Plan and 1,722,608 shares available for issuance under the Company's 2012 ESPP.
Other information required under this Item 12 is hereby incorporated by reference to the information responsive to
this Item contained in the Company's definitive proxy statement for its 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be
