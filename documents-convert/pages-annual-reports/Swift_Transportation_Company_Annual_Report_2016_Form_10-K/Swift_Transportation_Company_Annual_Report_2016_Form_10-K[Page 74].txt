0 Principal and InterestPayments—As of December 31 , 2016, we had material debt and capital lease obligations
of $1 .1 billion, which are discussed under "Material Debt Agreements," below. Asignificant amount of our cash
flows from operations are committed to minimum payments of principal and interest on our debt facilities and
lease obligations. Additionally, when our financial position allows, we periodically make voluntary prepayments
on our outstanding debt balances. As of January 2017, we have voluntarily prepaid all minimum quarterly
principal payments on our Term Loan A through its final maturity in July 2020.
0 Letters of Credit— Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 Agreement, our lenders may issue standby letters of
credit on our behalf. When we have letters of credit outstanding, it reduces the availability under the $600.0
million New Revolver. Standby letters of credit are typically issued for the benefit of third-party insurance
companies and state departments of insurance for the purpose of satisfying certain collateral requirements,
primarily related to our automobile, workers' compensation, and general insurance liabilities. Our outstanding
letters of credit have historically been in the range of approximately $95.0 million to $150.0 million.
0 Share Repurchases— From time to time, and depending on free cash flow availability, debt levels, stock prices,
general economic and market conditions, as well as Board approval, we may repurchase shares of our
outstanding common stock. In September 2015, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0
million of its outstanding Class A common stock. We finished our repurchases under this authorization in
January 2016. In February 2016, the Board authorized an additional $150.0 million in share repurchases, of
which $62.9 million remained available as of December 31, 2016. See further details regarding our share
