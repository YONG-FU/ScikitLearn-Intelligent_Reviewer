(1) Represents borrowings owed at December 31, 2016. Interest rates vary.
(2) Represents principal payments owed at December 31, 2016. The borrowing consists of capital leases with
finance companies, fixed borrowing amounts, and fixed interest rates, as set forth on each applicable lease
schedule. Accordingly, interest on each lease varies between schedules. The Company's capital leases are
typically structured with balloon payments at the end of the lease term equal to the residual value the Company
is contracted to receive from certain equipment manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers.
(3) Represents interest obligations on long-term debt, the 2015 RSA, and capital lease obligations. For variable
rate debt, the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2016 was utilized. The table assumes long-term debt
and the 2015 RSA are held to maturity.
(4) Represents future monthly rental payment obligations, which include an interest element, under operating leases
for tractors, trailers, chassis, and facilities. Substantially all lease agreements for revenue equipment have fixed
payment terms based on the passage of time. We lease 8,086 tractors under operating leases, which includes
5,234 company tractors and 2,852 owner-operator tractors financed by the Company. The tractor lease
agreements generally stipulate maximum miles and provide for mileage penalties for excess miles. These leases
generally run for a period of three to five years for tractors and five to seven years for trailers.
(5) Represents purchase obligations for revenue equipment, facilities, and non-revenue equipment, of which a
significant portion is expected to be financed with operating and capital leases to the extent available. We have
