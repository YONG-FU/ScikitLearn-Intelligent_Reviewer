IITEM 7A. QUANTITA TIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK |
We have exposure from variable interest rates, primarily related to our 2015 Agreement, and 2015 RSA. These
variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short-term interest rates. We primarily manage interest rate
exposure through a mix of variable rate debt (weighted average rate of 1.9% and 1.9% as of December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively). Assuming the current level of borrowings, a hypothetical one percentage point increase in
interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by $9.0 million.
We have commodity exposure with respect to fuel used in company-owned tractors. Increases in fuel prices would
continue to raise our operating costs, even after applying fuel surcharge revenue. Historically, we have been able
to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges. The weekly average
diesel price per gallon in the United States, as reported by the DOE, decreased from an average of $2.71 per gallon
for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2.30 per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2016. We cannot
predict the extent or speed of potential changes in fuel price levels in the future, the degree to which the lag effect
of our fuel surcharge programs will impact us as a result of the timing and magnitude of such changes, or the extent
to which effective fuel surcharges can be maintained and collected to offset such increases. We generally have not
used derivative financial instruments to hedge our fuel price exposure in the past, but continue to evaluate this
possibility.
