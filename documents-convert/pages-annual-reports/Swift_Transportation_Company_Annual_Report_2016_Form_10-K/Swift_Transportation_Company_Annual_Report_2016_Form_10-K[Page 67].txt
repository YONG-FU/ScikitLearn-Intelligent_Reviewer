Pay rates for the owner-operators we contract with may increase further in future periods as the economy strengthens
and other employment alternatives become more available.

Insurance and claims expense consists of insurance premiums and estimated payments and expenses for claims
for bodily injury, property damage, cargo damage, and other casualty events, as well as owner-operator policies
through our captive insurance subsidiary. The primary factors affecting our insurance and claims are the number
of miles driven by our drivers and owner-operators, the frequency and severity of accidents, trends in the development
factors used in our actuarial accruals, and developments in large, prior-year claims. Furthermore, our self-insured
retention of $10.0 million per occurrence for accident claims can cause volatility in this expense.
The increase in insurance and claims was primarily due to an increase in collision expense related to company
equipment, as well as negative developments within both prior year and current year claims associated with the
owner-operator policies provided under our captive insurance company. Additionally, despite our total crashes per
million miles decreasing 4.9% from 2015 to 2016, our insurance and claims expense for bodily injury and property
damage increased slightly as a result of our average cost per claim reserve increasing, due to negative development
of prior and current year claims.

Rental expense consists primarily of payments for tractors and trailers financed with operating leases. Depreciation
and amortization of property and equipment consists primarily of depreciation for owned tractors and trailers and
amortization of those financed with capital leases. The primary factors affecting these expense items are the size
and age of our revenue equipment fleet, the cost of new equipment, and the relative percentage of owned versus
leased equipment. We believe it is appropriate to combine our rental expense with our depreciation and amortization
of property and equipment for analytical purposes because the mix of our leased versus owned tractors varies from
period to period.
Combined rental expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment slightly increased overall
and as a percentage of Revenue xFSR (primarily due to an increase in depreciation resulting from a reduction in
the residual values of certain tractors). This was partially offset by a decrease in tractor and trailer units from 2015
to 2016.
