Valuation Allowance — As of December 31, 2016, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards remaining, with estimated tax effects of $0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The federal and
state net operating losses will expire at various times between 2017 and 2030. The Company has not established
a valuation allowance as it has been determined that, based upon available evidence, a valuation allowance is not
required. Management asserts that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets. All other deferred tax assets are expected to be realized
and utilized by continued profitability in future periods.
