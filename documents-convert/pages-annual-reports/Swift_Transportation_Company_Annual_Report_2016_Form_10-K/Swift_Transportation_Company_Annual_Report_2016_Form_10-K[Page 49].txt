Results of Operations — Comparison Between the Years Ended December 37, 2015 and 2014
The $36.4 million increase in net income from $161.2 million in 2014 to $197.6 million in 2015, reflects the following:
(1) $246.6 million increase in Revenue xFSR — This was driven by increases in the Truckload, Dedicated, lntermodal,
and Non-reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in Revenue xFSR in the Swift Refrigerated segment.
(2) $316.0 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue due to declining fuel prices.
(3) $175.1 million decrease in fuel expense, due to declining fuel prices and improved fuel efficiency, partially offset by
an increase in total miles driven by company drivers.
(4) $140.9 million decrease in purchased transportation — This was attributed to reduced fuel reimbursements to the
owner-operators we contract with and other third parties, as a result of declining fuel prices and a 5.4% decrease in
miles driven by the owner-operators we contract with. This was partially offset by increases in owner-operator
contracted pay rates, as well as growth in our logistics business.
(5) $141.3 million increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits, which was primarily due to a 10.3% increase in
total miles driven by company drivers, higher company driver wage rates, and an increase in non-driver headcount.
(6) $45.7 million increase in operating supplies and expenses, primarily attributed to higher equipment maintenance
costs, which were due to an increase in total miles driven by company drivers, in-servicing new tractors, and processing
used tractors for sale. A $5.1 million settlement of a class action lawsuit and related costs was also included here in
2015.
(7) $41.8 million increase in rent and depreciation expense, which was affected by additional depreciation, maintenance,
and staging expenses, resulting from a backlog of trucks that were being processed for trade or sale in the latter half
of 2015.
(8) $20.3 million increase in insurance and claims expense, primarily due to the first three quarters in 2015, when we
had adverse current-year development of certain prior-year claims, higher claims severity trends and higher claims
frequency trends.
(9) $41.7 million decrease in interest expense, primarily driven by the call of our Senior Notes in November 2014.
(10) $30.3 million decrease in loss on debt extinguishment — $9.6 million loss on debt extinguishment in 2015 from
replacing the 2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, compared to $39.9 million loss on debt extinguishment in
2014 ($34.7 million from redeeming our Senior Notes and $5.2 million from replacing the 2013 Agreement with the
2014 Agreement).
(11) $29.7 million increase in income tax expense driven by an increase in income before income taxes and an increase
in the effective tax rate from 35.7% in 2014 to 37.6% in 2015.
(12) $3.4 million increase in other expenses includes a $6.0 million increase in non-operating expenses for a lawsuit that
was settled in June 2015, a $1.5 million increase from a pre-tax impairment of a non-operating note receivable in
2015, partially offset by a $2.3 million decrease reflecting an impairment related to certain operations software in
2014.
