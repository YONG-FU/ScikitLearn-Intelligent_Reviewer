The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-
pricing model, which uses a number of assumptions to determine the fair value of the options on the grant date.
The following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock options
issued:
Year Ended December 31,
7 2016 2015 2014 7
Dividend yield (1) ’ —% 7* —% " —% 7
Risk-free rate of return (2) 1.23% 1.41% 1.28%
Expected volatility (3) 40.33% 37.22% 40.00%
Expected term (in years) (4) 4.9 5.8 5.8
Weighted average fair value of stock options granted...... $6.39 $6.96 $6.79
(1) The dividend yield assumption is based on anticipated dividend payouts.
(2) The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the United States Treasury yield curve at the grant date with
maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date.
(3) The Company estimates the expected volatility and expected option life assumption consistent with ASC Topic
718, Compensation — Stock Compensation. Beginning in 2016, we used our internal historical prices over the
expected term of the options to determine our expected volatility. Prior to that, expected volatility was based
upon an analysis of historical prices of similar market capitalized trucking group participants within the Dow
Jones Total United States Market Index over the expected term of the options. The Company chose a daily
measurement interval for historical volatility as it believes this better depicts the nature of employee option
exercise decisions being based on shorter-term trends in the price of the underlying shares, rather than on
monthly price movements.
(4) As a result of the inability to predict the expected future employee exercise behavior, the Company estimated
the expected term of the options using a simplified method based on contractual and vesting terms of the
options. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and records stock-based
compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.
