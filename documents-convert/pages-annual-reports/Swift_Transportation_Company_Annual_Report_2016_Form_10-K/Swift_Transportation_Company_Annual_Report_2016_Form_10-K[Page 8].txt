Such statements appear under the headings entitled Risk Factors, Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Business. When used in this report, the words "estimates,"
"expects," "anticipates," "projects," "forecasts," "plans," "intends," "believes," "foresees," "seeks," "likely," "may,"
"will," "could," "should," "goal," "target," and variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions
of any such words) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, we, through our senior
management, from time to time make fon/vard-looking public statements concerning our expected future operations
and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
that may change at any time, and therefore, our actual results may differ materially from those that we expected.
Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on ourforward-looking statements. We derive many of ourforward-
looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions.
While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of
known factors, and of course, it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. All
