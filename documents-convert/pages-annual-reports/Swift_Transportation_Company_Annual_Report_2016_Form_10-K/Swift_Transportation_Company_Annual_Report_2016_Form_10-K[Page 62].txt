Non-reportable Segments Operating (Loss) Income —The non-reportable segments incurred an operating loss
in 2016, as compared to operating income in 2015. In addition to the decrease in operating revenue, discussed
above, the unfavorable change was driven by an increase in purchased transportation expenses within the logistics
business and increased maintenance expenses for our services provided to owner-operators. Additionally, the one-
time expense pertaining to Jerry Moyes' retirement package was recorded within the non-reportable segments in
September 2016. This is discussed in more detail in "Salaries, Wages, and Employee Benefits" under "Results of
Operations — Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses," below.
Operating income in 2015 included a $5.1 million charge associated with the settlement of a class-action lawsuit
and related costs.

Truckload Revenue — Operating revenue decreased in 2015, compared to 2014. Compared to 2014, Revenue
xFSR increased by 4.7% in 2015, impacted by:
- 4.0% increase in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile, primarily driven by pricing increases and freight mix.
- 0.7% increase in total loaded miles.
The following factors impacted the 2.8% increase in weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor:
- 4.0% increase in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile.
- partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in loaded miles per tractor per week from disruption associated with trading
and in-servicing more tractors in 2015, compared to 2014. This was the result of our acceleration of the average
trade-in cycle for our tractors.
Truckload Operating Income — Operating income decreased slightly from 2014 to 2015. This was primarily driven
by the factors discussed within "Truckload Revenue," above, and "Truckload Adjusted Operating Ratio," below.
TruckloadAdjusted Operating Ratio —Adjusted Operating Ratio increased 70 basis points for 2015, as compared
to 2014. This was primarily caused by the increases in wages for our company drivers and contracted pay rates
for owner-operators, discussed above, as well as adverse development of prior-year insurance claims and
corresponding increase in reserves. This was partially offset by increases in customer pricing, as well as reduced
fuel expense associated with declining fuel prices and better fuel efficiency.
