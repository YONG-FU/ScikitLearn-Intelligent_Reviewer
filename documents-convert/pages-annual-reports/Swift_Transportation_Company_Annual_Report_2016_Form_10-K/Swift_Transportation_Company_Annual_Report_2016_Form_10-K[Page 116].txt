I Recent Developments and Current Status
Before and during 2016, the Rudsell, Peck, Peck PAGA, Mares, McKinsty, and Nilsen complaints were stayed,
pending resolution of earlier-filed cases. In May 2016, the Burnell plaintiffs were denied class certification. Their
subsequent petition to appeal the decertification order was also denied. Following the Burnell plaintiffs' failure to
certify the class, the stays on certain cases were lifted. Those cases are now in discovery. Based on the current
procedural nature of the cases, the final disposition of the matter and impact to the Company cannot be determined
at this time. The likelihood that a loss has been incurred is remote.
