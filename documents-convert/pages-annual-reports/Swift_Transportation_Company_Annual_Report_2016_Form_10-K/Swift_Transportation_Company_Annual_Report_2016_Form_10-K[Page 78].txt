:Net Cash Used in Investing Activities: Comparison Between 2015 and 2016:
[ﬁcaagh ﬁlm; ]
(6) $103.2 million decrease in capital expenditures from 2015 to 2016, due to the timing of lease financing versus
cash capital expenditures. Our primary focus in 2016 has been fleet utilization. As such, we did not add net
capacity within our truck count during 2016; however, we did replace older revenue equipment with new
equipment during this time. These replacements were primarily funded using operating leases, as compared
to 2015, when our revenue equipment additions were funded using a mixture of operating leases, capital leases,
and cash on hand.
(7) $7.8 million favorable change in restricted cash and cash equivalents. Changes in the balance are driven by
the amount and timing of future claims payments by our captive insurance companies. The restricted cash and
cash equivalents balance increased $1.8 million during 2016, as compared to $9.6 million during 2015.
(8) $8.2 million net remaining favorable variance was related to various factors that had an immaterial impact on
net cash used in investing activities, individually and in aggregate.

Cash Flow Impact of the 2075 Agreement: The 2015 Agreement includes a $600.0 million New Revolver and a
$680.0 million New Term Loan A. Upon closing in July 2015, the proceeds from the New Term Loan A, a $200.0
million draw on the New Revolver and $4.9 million cash on hand were used to pay off the then-outstanding balances
of the Old Term Loan A ($485.0 million) and Term Loan B ($395.0 million), including accrued interest and fees under
the 2014 Agreement, as well as certain transactional fees associated with the 2015 Agreement.
Cash Flow Impact of the 2074 Agreement: In June 2014, we entered into the 2014 Agreement, replacing the 2013
Agreement. Total proceeds received under the 2014 Agreement included $50.0 million at closing under the $500.0
million delayed-draw Old Term Loan Aand $400.0 million under the Term Loan B. Additionally, we borrowed $164.0
million under the Old Revolver of the 2014 Agreement. With these proceeds, we repaid the then-existing first lien
term loan B-1 tranche and first lien term loan B-2 tranche under the 2013 Agreement with outstanding principal
balances of $229.0 million and $370.9 million plus accrued interest, respectively, and paid $10.5 million in deferred
financing fees at closing. The Company subsequently drew the remaining $450.0 million available on the Old Term
Loan A to facilitate redemption of the Senior Notes in November 2014.
