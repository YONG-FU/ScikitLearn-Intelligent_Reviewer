Swift Refrigerated Revenue — Operating revenue decreased from 2014 to 2015. Additionally, Revenue xFSR
decreased by 1.9%, primarily driven by:
- 4.3% reduction in Revenue xF SR per loaded mile. In the first quarter of 201 5, we ceased servicing a large Swift
Refrigerated specialty dedicated account. This dedicated account was not profitable and skewed our operational
metrics since it operated with a much lower average length of haul, higher deadhead, and much higher Revenue
xFSR per loaded mile, as compared to other accounts.
~ partially offset by a 2.4% increase in total loaded miles.
Swift Refrigerated Operating Income —Operating income increased 21 .7% from 201 4 to 2015. This was primarily
driven by the factors discussed within "Swift Refrigerated Revenue," above, and "Swift Refrigerated Adjusted
Operating Ratio," below.
Swift Refrigerated Adjusted Operating Ratio — Adjusted Operating Ratio improved 100 basis points from 2014
to 2015. These improvements were driven by reduced fuel expense associated with declining fuel prices and
improved fuel efficiency, as well as a decrease in deadhead. Increases in company driver wages and owner-operator
contracted pay rates as well as increased insurance and claims expense, partially offset these items.

5.1%, primarily due to a 5.2% increase in load counts. COF C loads increased 11.0%, while TOF C loads decreased
54.2%, as we shifted away from the unprofitable refrigerated TOFC business in 2014.
