Swift Refrigerated Revenue — The decrease in operating revenue for 2016, as compared to 2015, consisted of
a $14.2 million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, and a $24.8 million decrease in Revenue
XFSR. The 7.6% decrease in Revenue XFSR reflects the following:
- 3.6% decrease in Revenue XFSR per loaded mile, and a
- 4.0% decrease in total loaded miles.
The refrigerated market remained challenging as shippers continued to take advantage of the spot market, leading
to sustained pricing pressures. This, along with the cost structure inherent in operating a refrigerated business,
unfavorably impacted the profitability of this segment. In response to these market challenges, Swift Refrigerated
continued to work on securing quality freight, improving asset utilization, and controlling costs. These efforts
contributed to an increase in weekly Revenue XFSR per tractor of 2.9%, which was favorably impacted by a 6.8%
increase in loaded miles per tractor per week and unfavorably impacted by the decrease in Revenue XFSR per
loaded mile, noted above. During 2016, we continued refining our refrigerated network, allowing more efficient
matching of trucks with freight. As a result, deadhead percentage in this segment improved.
Swift Refrigerated Operating (Loss) Income — Swift Refrigerated recognized an operating loss for 2016, as
compared to operating income for 2015. The unfavorable change was driven by the decrease in Revenue XFSR,
discussed above, and the factors discussed within "Swift Refrigerated Adjusted Operating Ratio," below.
Swift Refrigerated Adjusted Operating Ratio — Adjusted Operating Ratio significantly increased from 2015, as
compared to 2016, This was primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue XFSR, discussed above, as well as a
$22.0 million increase in legal reserves related to unfavorable developments associated with certain litigation within
this segment. This was partially offset by decreases in rent expense, salaries and wages, and other operating
expenses from our initiatives to improve cost control.
