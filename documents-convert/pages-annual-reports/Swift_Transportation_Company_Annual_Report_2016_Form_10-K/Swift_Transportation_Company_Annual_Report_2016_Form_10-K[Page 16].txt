Revenue Equipment 2
We operate a modern company tractor fleet to help attract and retain drivers, promote safe operations, and reduce
maintenance and repair costs. The following table shows the age of our owned and leased tractors and trailers as
of December 31, 2016:
Model Year 7 7 Tractors (1) 7 7 Trailers 7
22017 7 1,225” 6,6967
2006 and prior 7 262” 23,610
Total : 13,937,777 64,066:
(1) Excludes 4,429 owner-operator tractors.
We typically purchase or lease tractors and trailers manufactured to our specifications. We follow a comprehensive
maintenance program designed to reduce downtime and enhance the resale value of our equipment. We have
major maintenance facilities in the following locations:
- Phoenix, Arizona
0 Memphis, Tennessee
- Greer, South Carolina
~ West Valley City, Utah
- Columbus, Ohio
0 Laredo, Texas
- Jurupa Valley, California
in addition to these maintenance facilities, we perform routine servicing and maintenance of our revenue equipment
at most of our regional terminal facilities, in an effort to avoid costly on-road repairs and deadhead miles. The
contracts governing our equipment purchases typically contain specifications of equipment, projected delivery dates,
warranty terms, and trade or return conditions, and are cancelable upon 60 to 90 days' notice without penalty.
Our tractor trade-in cycle range, depending on equipment type and usage, was 42 to 48 months and 36 to 48
months, during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our newer equipment has enhanced features, which we believe tends
to lower the overall life cycle costs by reducing safety-related expenses, lowering repair and maintenance expenses,
improving fuel economy, and improving driver satisfaction. In 2017 and beyond, we will continue to monitor the
appropriateness of this relatively short tractor trade-in cycle against the lower capital expenditure and financing
costs of a longer tractor trade-in cycle, based on current and future business needs.
