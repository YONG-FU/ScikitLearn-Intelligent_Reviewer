(1) Pre-tax non-cash impairments included:
- 2016 and 2014: Refer to "Impairments" under "Results of Operations — Consolidated Operating and Other
Expenses," below.
- 2012: $2.3 million lost deposit on fuel technology and related equipment because a supplier ceased operations
and $1.1 million for impaired real property.
(2) For 2015, refer to "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" discussion under "Results of Operations —
Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses," below. In 2012, non-cash impairments of non-operating assets
pertained to Swift Power Services, LLC ("SPS"), an entity in which we owned a minority interest and held a secured
promissory note. SPS failed to make its first scheduled principal payment to us on the secured promissory note, as
well as a quarterly interest payment on December 31, 2012. This was due to a decline in its financial performance
resulting from, among other things, a legal dispute with the former owners and its primary customer. This caused us
to evaluate the secured promissory note due from SPS for impairment, which resulted in a $6.0 million pre-tax
adjustment that was recorded in "Impairments of non-operating assets" in the fourth quarter of 2012.
(3) For 2014 and 2015, refer to "Loss on Debt Extinguishment" discussion under "Results of Operations — Consolidated
Operating and Other Expenses," below. In 2013, we incurred a $5.5 million loss on debt extinguishment resulting
from the repayment in full of certain outstanding Central debt at closing of the Central Acquisition, resulting in a loss
on debt extinguishment of $0.5 million, and $5.0 million from the replacement of the 2012 Agreement with the 2013
Agreement. In 2012, we incurred $20.9 million in loss on debt extinguishment from replacing the previous first lien
term loan with the 2012 Agreement and $1.3 million from redeeming the remaining fixed rate notes.
(4) In 2013, Central incurred a $0.9 million one-time non-cash equity compensation charge for certain options that
accelerated upon the closing of the Central Acquisition.
