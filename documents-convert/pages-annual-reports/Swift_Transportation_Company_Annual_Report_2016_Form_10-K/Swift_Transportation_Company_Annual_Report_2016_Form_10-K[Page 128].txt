Note 20 — Weighted Average Shares Outstanding
Basic and diluted earnings per share, as presented in the consolidated income statements, are calculated by dividing
net income by the respective weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.
The following table reconciles basic weighted average shares outstanding to diluted weighted average shares
outstanding:

Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 134,139 142,018 141,431
Dilutive effect of stock options 7 1,355” 1,650” 2,044
Diluted weighted average common shares 7 7 7 7 7 7

greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares during the period.
Note 21 — Fair Value Measurement
ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values
for its financial instruments. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Fair value estimates are made at a
specific point in time and are based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the
Company's entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect
these estimates. Because the fair value is estimated as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the amounts that will
actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments in the future could be significantly different.
The tables below exclude certain financial instruments. The excluded financial instruments are as follows: cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net accounts receivable, income tax refund receivable, and accounts payable.
The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximate carrying value as they are short-term in nature.
Additionally, for notes payable under revolving lines of credit, fair value approximates the carrying value due to the
variable interest rate. For capital leases, the carrying value approximates the fair value. The table below also
excludes financial instruments reported at estimated fair value on a recurring basis. See "Recurring Fair Value
Measurements." All remaining balance sheet amounts excluded from the table below are not considered financial
instruments subject to this disclosure.
