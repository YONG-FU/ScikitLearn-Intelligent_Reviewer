lntermodal Revenue — The decrease in operating revenue for 2016, as compared to 2015, consisted of a $16.0
million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices, and a $14.4 million decrease in Revenue xFSR.
The 4.2% decrease in Revenue xF SR reflects the following:
- 5.1% decrease in load count, partially offset by a
- 0.9% increase in Revenue xFSR per load.
Securing lntermodal freight that met our internal pricing requirements continued to be a challenge in 2016, as United
States rail traffic was lower overall in 2016, as compared to 2015. There were container and freight imbalances
and increased pricing pressures, as an increasing number of lntermodal providers continued with their attempts to
balance their networks and gain volume through aggressive pricing. COFC loads decreased by 2.5%, while TOFC
loads were progressively ramped down, as we strategically focused on our CO F C service. In March 2016, the TOFC
service offering was completely eliminated, which we believe allows for increased operational efficiencies.
lntermodal Operating (Loss) Income — lntermodal incurred an operating loss of $0.5 million during 2016, as
compared to operating income of $4.1 million for 2015. This was primarily driven by the factors discussed within
"lntermodal Revenue," above, and "lntermodal Adjusted Operating Ratio," below.
lntermodal Adjusted Operating Ratio — Adjusted Operating Ratio increased 140 basis points for 2016, as
compared to 2015. This was primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue xF SR, discussed above, partially offset
by the favorable impacts from our initiatives to improve our cost infrastructure and operational efficiencies.

Non-reportable Segments Revenue — Operating revenue within our non-reportable segments decreased from
2015 to 2016. This was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from services provided to owner-operators, partially
offset by growth in the logistics business.
