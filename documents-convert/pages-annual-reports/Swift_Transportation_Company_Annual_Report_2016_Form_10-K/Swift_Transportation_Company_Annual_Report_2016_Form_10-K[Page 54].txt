our performance relative to that of our competitors. Our method of computing Adjusted EBITDA is consistent with that
used in our debt covenants, specifically our leverage ratio, and is also routinely reviewed by management for that purpose.
The following table is a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:

(1) Refer to footnote (1) to the Adjusted EPS reconciliation for a description of "Non-cash impairments."
(2) Represents recurring non-cash equity compensation expense, on a pre-tax basis. In accordance with the terms of
the 2015 Agreement, this expense is added back in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for covenant compliance
purposes. In addition to non-cash equity compensation in 2013, Central incurred a $0.9 million one-time charge for
certain options that accelerated upon closing of the Central Acquisition.
(3) For 2014 and 2015, refer to "Loss on Debt Extinguishment" discussion under "Results of Operations — Consolidated
Operating and Other Expenses," below. In 2013, we incurred a $5.5 million loss on debt extinguishment resulting
from the repayment in full of certain outstanding Central debt at closing of the Central Acquisition, resulting in a loss
on debt extinguishment of $0.5 million, and $5.0 million from the replacement of the 2012 Agreement with the 2013
Agreement. In 2012, we incurred $20.9 million in loss on debt extinguishment from replacing the previous first lien
term loan with the 2012 Agreement and $1.3 million from redeeming the remaining fixed rate notes.
(4) Refer to footnote (5) to the Adjusted EPS reconciliation for a description of "Excludable transaction costs."
(5) For 2015, refer to "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" discussion under "Results of Operations —
Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses," below. In 2012, non-cash impairments of non-operating assets
pertained to Swift Power Services, LLC ("SPS"), an entity in which we owned a minority interest and held a secured
promissory note. SPS failed to make its first scheduled principal payment to us on the secured promissory note, as
well as a quarterly interest payment on December 31, 2012. This was due to a decline in its financial performance
resulting from, among other things, a legal dispute with the former owners and its primary customer. This caused us
to evaluate the secured promissory note due from SP8 for impairment, which resulted in a $6.0 million pre-tax
adjustment that was recorded in "Impairments of non-operating assets" in the fourth quarter of 2012.
