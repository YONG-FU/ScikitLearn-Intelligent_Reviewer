In connection with the VPF transactions described above, an aggregate of approximately 34.3 million shares of
Class B common stock and approximately 2.0 million shares of Class A common stock are collateralized to secure
M Capital “'3 and Cactus Holding l's respective obligations under the VPF transactions.
Mr. Moyes’ counter party to the VPFs hedges their position by borrowing shares of Class A common stock and
subsequently selling such shares, creating a short position. This hedging activity will fluctuate from time to time,
based on the current market price of the Class A common stock and the counter party's strategy for reducing risk
in their position. This hedging activity may place additional pressure on the price of the Class A common stock as
such short positions are being put in place and/or may create a perception that the market is questioning Swift's
performance given the large short position that can occur and be reported. Maintaining this short position may
offset some of the risk associated with a full share settlement of the VPF transactions as any shares received by
the counter party might be used to settle these short positions thus reducing the amount that would otherwise be
introduced to the market.
