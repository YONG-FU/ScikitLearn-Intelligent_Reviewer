Note 15 — Leases
The Company finances a portion of its revenue equipment under capital and operating leases and certain terminals
under operating leases.
Capital Leases (as Lessee)— The Company's capital leases are typically structured with balloon payments at the
end of the lease term equal to the residual value the Company is contracted to receive from certain equipment
manufacturers upon sale or trade back to the manufacturers. If the Company does not receive proceeds of the
contracted residual value from the manufacturer, the Company is still obligated to make the balloon payment at the
end of the lease term. Certain leases contain renewal or fixed price purchase options. The present value of
obligations under capital leases is included under "Current portion of capital lease obligations" and "Capital lease
obligations, less current portion" in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016, the leases were
collateralized by revenue equipment with a cost of $319.8 million and accumulated amortization of $97.0 million.
As of December 31, 2015, the leases were collateralized by revenue equipment with a cost of $357.8 million and
accumulated amortization of $90.1 million. Amortization of the equipment under capital leases is included in
"Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment" in the Company's consolidated income statements.
Operating Leases (as Lessee)— The revenue equipment leases generally include a purchase option exercisable
at the completion of the lease. The Company does not currently guarantee residual values under its operating lease
agreements for revenue equipment.
Rent expense related to operating leases was $226.3 million, $240.5 million, and $229.3 million for the years ended
December 31 , 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
