Truckload Revenue —The decrease in operating revenue for 2016, as compared to 2015, consisted of an $80.5
million decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lower fuel prices (on average), and a $75.6 million decrease in
Revenue xFSR. The 3.9% decrease in Revenue xFSR reflects the following:
- 2.6% decrease in total loaded miles, and a
- 1.3% decrease in Revenue xFSR per loaded mile.
The 2.9% decrease in weekly Revenue XFSR per tractor reflects the following:
- 1.6% decrease in loaded miles per tractor per week, and the
- 1.3% decrease in Revenue XFSR per loaded mile, noted above.
Truckload volumes and pricing continued to be challenged with excess industry capacity, excess customer
inventories, and depressed shipping demand during 2016. We continued our participation in the spot market during
the year to help offset the lack of available freight in certain markets. This helped to balance our network, but had
a negative impact on Revenue xFSR per loaded mile. We continue to monitor our spot market activity and expect
to reduce our participation.
Truckload Operating Income — Operating income decreased for 2016, as compared to 2015, which was primarily
driven by the decrease in Revenue XFSR, discussed above. Other factors that affected operating income are
discussed within "Truckload Adjusted Operating Ratio," below.
Truckload Adjusted Operating Ratio — Adjusted Operating Ratio increased 350 basis points for 2016, as
compared to 2015. This was primarily driven by the decrease in Revenue xFSR, discussed above. In addition to
the industry challenges associated with volumes and pricing that negatively affected Revenue xF SR, the continued
soft used truck market contributed to an increase in depreciation expense (due to a change in projected residual
values of certain trucks) and a decrease in gain on disposals of property and equipment. Additionally, driver salaries
and wages expense increased, primarily due to the company driver wage increase implemented in May 2015.
Throughout 2016, we continued to implement various measures to improve cost control and efficiency, including
right-sizing the fleet to drive improvements in asset utilization, improving freight and equipment network balance,
continuing to focus on driver safety and satisfaction, and other cost control initiatives to partially offset the negative
impacts from the items noted above.
