Note 23 — Jerry Moyes' Retirement
in conjunction with the Company's September 8, 2016 announcement that Jerry Moyes would retire from his position
as Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Moyes
to memorialize the terms of his retirement. The Company contracted with Mr. Moyes to serve as a non-employee
consultant from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, during which time the Company will pay Mr. Moyes
a monthly consulting fee of $0.2 million in cash. Additionally, the Company modified the vesting terms and forfeiture
conditions of Mr. Moyes' previously-granted equity awards. As a result of the terms of the agreement, the Company
incurred a one-time expense in September 2016 of $7.1 million, consisting of $6.8 million in accrued consulting
fees and $0.3 million for the impact of the equity award modifications. The amounts are included in "Salaries, wages,
and employee benefits" within the non-reportable segments' income statement.
The following is a rollforward of the accrued liability for the consulting fees:

balance sheet, based on the timing of the expected payment. The $0.3 million impact of the equity award
modification is excluded from the accrual balance because it is classified as "Additional paid-in capital" in the
consolidated balance sheet.
