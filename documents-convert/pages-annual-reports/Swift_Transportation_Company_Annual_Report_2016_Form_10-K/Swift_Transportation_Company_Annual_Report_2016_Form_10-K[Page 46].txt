changes in miles. However, changes in mileage are affected by driver satisfaction and network efficiency, which
indirectly affect expenses.
2016 Initiatives —The truckload freight environment in 2016 was challenging. Excess industry capacity, excess
customer inventories, and depressed shipping demand pressured volumes and pricing. We implemented the
following initiatives to help counter the effects of these external factors:
0 We downsized our core truckload fleet in an effort to improve asset utilization, and we continue to closely
monitor and adjust our truckload fleet size to ensure proper utilization of our fleets.
~ We selectively increased our participation in the spot market to improve network balance and help offset the
lack of available freight in certain markets. Our sales team remains heavily focused on increasing freight levels
with both new and existing customer contracts, with the goal of eventually reducing our spot market activity.
~ We implemented several cost control initiatives throughout the organization, which include streamlining
processes, reducing headcount, postponing non-critical system implementations, and reducing expenses in
various other manners.

(1) Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Ratio, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. These
non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives, or superior, to GAAP financial measures.
However, management believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful
information to investors regarding the Company's results of operations. Adjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating
