Interest Expense — Interest expense is comprised of debt interest expense, as well as amortization of deferred
financing costs and OID. The decrease in interest expense in 2015 was primarily driven by our call of the Senior
Notes in November 2014. Also contributing to the decrease in interest expense was the impact of replacing the
2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, which had lower interest rates.
Derivative Interest Expense — Derivative interest expense reflects losses reclassified from AOCI into net income
from the effective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as the income effect of mark-to-market adjustments and
current settlements of interest rate swaps, which were de-designated in February 2013. The final settlement of our
interest rate swaps occurred in July 2015. As such, there was no derivative interest expense thereafter, causing
the decrease in the expense from 2014 to 2015.
LossionierLExtingutstzment — In July 2015, we replaced the 2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, which
resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.6 million, reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OID and deferred
financing fees related to the 2014 Agreement.
In November 2014, the Company redeemed, in full, the remaining $428.1 million face value of its Senior Notes. The
Company paid 105% of face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to call the Senior Notes. The November 2014
redemption followed a series of refinancing transactions that occurred in the first nine months of 2014, in which the
Company used cash on hand to repurchase $71.9 million in principal of the Senior Notes at an average price of
109.05%. In total, these transactions resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $34.7 million, reflecting the write-
off of the unamortized OID.
Also, in June 2014, we replaced the 2013 Agreement with the 2014 Agreement, which resulted in a loss on debt
extinguishment of $5.2 million, reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OID and deferred financing fees related
to the 2013 Agreement and the previous revolving credit line.
NoniasbjmpatrmentsptjAIQn;ooeratIngAssets — In September 2013, the Company agreed to advance up to $2.3
million, pursuant to an unsecured promissory note, to an independent fleet contractor that transported freight on
Swift's behalf. In March 2015, management became aware that the independent contractor violated various
covenants outlined in the unsecured promissory note, which created an event of default that made the principal and
accrued interest immediately due and payable. As a result of this event of default, as well as an overall decline in
the independent contractor's financial condition, management re-evaluated the fair value of the unsecured
promissory note. At March 31,2015, management determined that the remaining balance due from the independent
contractor to the Company was not collectible, which resulted in a $1.5 million pre-tax adjustment that was recorded
in "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" in the Company's consolidated income statements.
EgaLSettIementsiandigesenzes — In June 2015, the Company settled a lawsuit relating to a contractual dispute
with a company in the business of supplying ancillary fuel system equipment. As a result of this settlement, we
incurred a $6.0 million expense.
Income Tax Expense —The effective tax rate in 2015 was 37.6%, which was lower than our expectation of 38.5%,
primarily due to federal employment income tax credits realized in the fourth quarter of 2015 from tax legislation
recently enacted, as well as the benefit of prior year federal employment income tax credits realized in the third
quarter of 2015.
