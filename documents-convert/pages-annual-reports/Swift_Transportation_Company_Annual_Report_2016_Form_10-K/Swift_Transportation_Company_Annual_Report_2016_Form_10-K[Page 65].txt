Results of Operations 7 7 Consolidated Operating and Other Expenses *
Operating Expenses — The following tables present certain operating expenses from our consolidated income
statements, including each operating expense as a percentage of operating revenue and as a percentage of Revenue
xF SR. Fuel surcharge revenue can be volatile and is primarily dependent upon the cost of fuel, rather than operation
expenses unrelated to fuel. Therefore, we believe that Revenue xFSR is a better measure for analyzing many of
our expenses and operating metrics.

Salaries, wages, and employee benefits are primarily affected by the total number of miles driven by company
drivers, the rate per mile we pay our company drivers, and employee benefits, including health care, workers'
compensation, and other benefits. Typically to a lesser extent, non-driver employee headcount, compensation, and
benefits affect the expense.
The increase in salaries, wages, and employee benefits was primarily due to the driver wage increase implemented
in May 2015 and an increase in group health insurance expenses. Miles driven by company drivers were relatively
flat from 2015 to 2016. The compensation paid to our company drivers and other employees may increase further
in future periods as the economy strengthens and other employment alternatives become more available.
Additionally, salaries, wages, and employee benefits increased due to Jerry Moyes' retirement package. In
conjunction with the Company's September 8, 2016 announcement that Mr. Moyes would retire from his position
as Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Moyes
to memorialize the terms of his retirement. The Company contracted with Mr. Moyes to serve as a non-employee
consultant from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, during which time the Company will pay Mr. Moyes
a monthly consulting fee of $0.2 million in cash. Additionally, the Company modified the vesting terms and forfeiture
conditions of Mr. Moyes' previously-granted equity awards. As a result of the terms of the agreement, the Company
incurred a one-time expense in September 2016 of $7.1 million, consisting of $6.8 million in accrued consulting
fees and $0.3 million for the impact of the equity award modifications. The amount is included in the non-reportable
segments' income statement.
