Note 24 — Information by Segment, Geography, and Customer Concentration
Segment Information
During 2016, we operated four reportable segments: Truckload, Dedicated, Swift Refrigerated, and lntermodal.
,EuQ/glaad — The truckload segment consists of one-way movements over irregular routes throughout the United
States, Mexico, and Canada. This service utilizes both company and owner-operator tractors with dry van, flatbed,
and other specialized trailing equipment.
Dedicated — Through the dedicated segment, the Company devotes use of equipment to specific customers and
offers tailored solutions under long-term contracts. This dedicated segment utilizes refrigerated, dry van, flatbed,
and other specialized trailing equipment.
Swift Refrigerated —This segment primarily consists of shipments for customers that require temperature-controlled
trailers. These shipments include one-way movements over irregular routes, as well as dedicated truck operations.
lntermodal —The intermodal segment includes revenue generated by moving freight over the rail in the Company's
containers and other trailing equipment, combined with revenue for drayage to transport loads between the railheads
and customer locations.
Non-reportable Segments — The other non-reportable segments include the Company's logistics and freight
brokerage services, as well as support services that its subsidiaries provide to customers and owner-operators,
including repair and maintenance shop services, equipment leasing, and insurance. Intangible asset amortization
related to the 2007 Transactions, certain legal settlements and reserves, and certain other corporate expenses are
also included in the other non-reportable segments.
latersegmeaLElIfmlnat/jaas — Certain operating segments provide transportation and related services for other
affiliates outside their reportable segment. Revenues for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we
believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenues of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from
time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenues and expenses are eliminated in our
consolidated results.
