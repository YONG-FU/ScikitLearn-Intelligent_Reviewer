statute of limitations, which represents the above decreases in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not
anticipate a decrease of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.
Tax Examinations — Certain of the Company's subsidiaries are currently under examination by various state
jurisdictions for tax years ranging from 2012 to 2015. At the completion of these examinations, management does
not expect any adjustments that would have a material impact on the Company's effective tax rate. Years subsequent
to 2012 remain subject to examination.
Interest and Penalties —Accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately
$0.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
RegulatoryDeve/opments — In December 2014, United States President, Barack Obama, signed the Tax Increase
Prevention Act of 2014 ("TIPA"). Among other things, TIPA extended 50% bonus depreciation and the Work
Opportunity Tax Credit ("WOTC"). During the first three quarters of 201 4, the Company did not include 50% bonus
depreciation or WOTC in its income tax provision, as these items were not allowed in 2014 prior to the passing of
the TIPA Act. Income tax calculations performed for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the full year's
adjustment for 50% bonus depreciation and WOTC, as TIPA allowed for retrospective inclusion.
In December 2015, President Obama signed the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes ("PATH") Act of 201 5. Among
other things, PATH extended 50% bonus depreciation and WOTC. During the first three quarters of 2015, the
Company did not include 50% bonus depreciation or WOTC in its income tax provision, as these items were not
allowed in 2015 prior to the passing of the PATH Act. Income tax calculations performed forthe year ended December
31, 2015 include the full year's adjustment for 50% bonus depreciation and WOTC, as PATH allowed for retrospective
inclusion.
Note 12 — Accounts Receivable Securitization
On December 10, 2015, SRCII, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the 2015 RSA, which
further amends the 2013 RSA. The parties to the 2015 RSA include SRCII as the seller, Swift Transportation Services,
LLC as the servicer, the various conduit purchasers, the various related committed purchasers, the various purchaser
agents, the various letters of credit participants, and PNC Bank, National Association as the issuing bank of letters
of credit and as administrator. Pursuant to the 2015 RSA, the Company's receivable originator subsidiaries sell,
on a revolving basis, undivided interests in all of their eligible accounts receivable to SRCII. In turn, SRCII sells a
variable percentage ownership interest in the eligible accounts receivable to the various purchasers. The facility
qualifies for treatment as a secured borrowing under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. As such, outstanding
amounts are classified as liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 21 for information
regarding the fair value of the 2015 RSA.
