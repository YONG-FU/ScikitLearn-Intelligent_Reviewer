Inflation *
Inflation can have an impact on our operating costs. A prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates, fuel,
wages, and other costs to increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates
correspondingly increased. However, the effect of inflation has been minor over the past three years.
Critical Accounting Estimates *
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with US—GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and associated
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions. We evaluate these
estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts, and other
methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly
from our estimates and assumptions, and it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported using
differing estimates or assumptions. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require us to
make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements.
