2074 Agreement — The Company entered into the 2014 Agreement on June 9, 2014, which was subsequently
replaced by the 2015 Agreement. The 2014 Agreement included the Old Term Loan A, a first lien Term Loan B
tranche, and the Old Revolver. The 2014 Agreement replaced the then-existing revolving credit line, as well as the
first lien term loan B-1 and B-2 tranches of the 2013 Agreement, which had outstanding principal balances at closing
of $229.0 million and $370.9 million, respectively. Upon closing, the Company drew $164.0 million on the Old
Revolver and $50.0 million on the Old Term Loan A. The Company subsequently drew the remaining $450.0 million
available on the Old Term Loan A to facilitate redemption of the Senior Notes in November 2014.

Senior Notes
In November 2014, the Company redeemed, in full, the remaining $428.1 million face value of its Senior Notes.
This was primarily funded with the proceeds from the Company's Old Term Loan A. The Company paid 105.0% of
face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to call the Senior Notes. While the redeemed Senior Notes incurred
interest at 10.0%, the source of funds from the Old Term Loan A incurred interest at LIBOR plus applicable margin
of 1 .50% to 2.25%. The November 2014 redemption followed a series of open market purchases that occurred in
the first nine months of 2014, in which the Company used cash on hand to repurchase $71.9 million in principal of
the Senior Notes. Including the November 2014 redemption, the Company repurchased the entire $500.0 million
in principal of the Senior Notes during 2014, at an average price of 105.58% of face value.
Payment of principal and interest on the Senior Notes was previously guaranteed by certain of the Company's 100%
owned domestic subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the guarantees
were subject to release at which time the subsidiaries no longer had indebtedness that would have required a
guarantee. Thus, the Company's redemption of the Senior Notes on November 15, 2014, released the related
guarantee.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment
The Company incurred no losses on debt extinguishment during the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year
ended December 31 , 2015, the Company incurred $9.6 million in losses on debt extinguishment, reflecting the write-
off of the unamortized OID and deferred financing fees related to the 2014 Agreement, which was replaced by the
2015 Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred $39.9 million in losses on debt
extinguishment related to the Company's redemption of its Senior Notes and the replacement of the 2013 Agreement
with the 2014 Agreement.
