Restricted StockAwards
Restricted stock awards are shares of Swift's Class A common stock that are subject to forfeiture until the lapse of
defined restrictions, including time-based restrictions. Restricted stock awards, which are granted in the form of
restricted stock RSUs and shares, are accounted for as equity awards. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of
restricted stock awards is based upon the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on the grant date.
RSU— This is typically the form of restricted stock award granted to Company employees. An RSU represents a
right to receive a common share of stock when the unit vests. RSU recipients cannot vote during the vesting period.
Employees forfeit their units if their employment terminates before the vesting date.
RestdctedStackﬁhare— This is typically the form of restricted stock award granted to the Board. Directors on the
Board are entitled to vote during the vesting period. For awards granted in 2014 and thereafter, the forfeiture
restrictions associated with restricted stock shares lapse on the first anniversary of the grant date with respect to
an equal installment of shares. For awards granted prior to 2014, the forfeiture restrictions associated with restricted
stock shares lapsed on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date with respect to an equal installment
of shares. Additionally, restricted stock shares are not transferable for a period of four years from the grant date,
other than for applicable tax withholdings.
