/nterest Expense — interest expense is comprised of debt interest expense, as well as amortization of DLCs, and
(with respect to 2015) OlD. The decrease in interest expense was driven by overall lower debt balances, as well
as more favorable interest rates and terms in the 2015 Agreement, which replaced the 2014 Agreement in July
2015.
Derivative Interest Expense — Derivative interest expense reflects losses reclassified from AOCI into net income
from the effective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as the income effect of mark-to-market adjustments and
current settlements of interest rate swaps, which were de-designated in February 2013. The final settlement of our
interest rate swaps occurred in July 2015.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment — In July 2015, we replaced the 2014 Agreement with the 2015 Agreement, which
resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of $9.6 million, reflecting the write-off of the unamortized OlD and DLCs
related to the 2014 Agreement.
Noniasbiimpairmentsptjiliongberatingﬁ,ssets — In September 2013, the Company agreed to advance up to $2.3
million, pursuant to an unsecured promissory note, to an independent fleet contractor that transported freight on
Swift's behalf. In March 2015, management became aware that the independent contractor violated various
covenants outlined in the unsecured promissory note, which created an event of default that made the principal and
accrued interest immediately due and payable. As a result of this event of default, as well as an overall decline in
the independent contractor's financial condition, management re-evaluated the fair value of the unsecured
promissory note. At March 31,2015, management determined that the remaining balance due from the independent
contractor to the Company was not collectible, which resulted in a $1.5 million pre-tax adjustment that was recorded
in "Non-cash impairments of non-operating assets" in the Company's consolidated income statements.
LagaLSettiementsiandigeserizes — In June 2016, we reserved $3.0 million for expected costs associated with a
certain legal matter.
in June 2015, the Company settled a lawsuit relating to a contractual dispute with a company in the business of
supplying ancillary fuel system equipment. As a result of this settlement, we incurred a $6.0 million expense.
incomeifaxiExbense —The effective tax rate in 2016 was 30.6%, which was lower than our expectation of 36.5%.
The difference reflects reduced taxes primarily due to a reduction of income before income taxes. Additionally,
federal domestic production activities deductions, certain income tax credits received by our foreign and domestic
subsidiaries, and a reduction in our uncertain tax position reserve contributed to the difference. We expect the
2017 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.0% to 37.0%.
The effective tax rate in 2015 was 37.6%, which was lower than our expectation of 38.5%, primarily due to federal
employment income tax credits realized in the fourth quarter of 2015 from tax legislation then-enacted, as well as
the benefit of prior year federal employment income tax credits realized in the third quarter of 2015.
Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional analysis related to income taxes.

company drivers, higher company driver wage rates discussed above, an increase in non-driver headcount, and
an increase in workers' compensation expense from adverse development of prior-year claims and corresponding
increase in reserves.
