Note 19 — Stock Plans
Qcmgcmsatqzétqck Plans
On March 28, 2014, the Board adopted the 2014 Stock Plan, which replaced the 2007 Stock Plan. The 2014 Stock
Plan became effective upon stockholder approval on May 8, 2014, after which date no new awards would be granted
under the 2007 Stock Plan. The 2007 Stock Plan continues to govern all awards granted under the 2007 Stock
Plan until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, canceled, or have otherwise expired or terminated.
The 2014 Stock Plan generally contains the same features, terms and conditions as the 2007 Stock Plan. Additionally,
the 2014 Stock Plan did not increase the number of shares of stock available for grant, which means that the number
of shares available for grant under the 2014 Stock Plan reflected the number of authorized but unissued (and not
subject to outstanding awards) under the 2007 Stock Plan as of the date the 2014 Stock Plan became effective.
The 2014 Stock Plan permits the payment of cash incentive compensation and authorizes the granting of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and RSUs, performance shares and performance units, cash-
based awards, and stock-based awards to the Company's employees and non-employee directors for up to 12.0
million shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate number of shares remaining
available under the 2014 Stock Plan was 4.3 million.

Stock Options
Stock options are the contingent right of award holders to purchase shares of Swift Transportation Company Class
A common stock at a stated price for a limited time. The exercise price of options granted equals the fair value of
the Company's common stock determined by the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock quoted on
the NYSE on the grant date. All options have a ten-year contractual term. Options granted in 2013 and later have
a vesting period of three years at a rate of 33 1/3% per year. Options granted prior to 2013 are fully vested.
