Lease classification is determined based on minimum rental payments per the agreement, including residual value
guarantees, when applicable, as well as receivables due to the Company upon default or cross-default. When
owner-operators default on their leases, the Company typically releases the equipment to other owner-operators.
As such, future minimum lease payments reflect original leases and re-leases.
