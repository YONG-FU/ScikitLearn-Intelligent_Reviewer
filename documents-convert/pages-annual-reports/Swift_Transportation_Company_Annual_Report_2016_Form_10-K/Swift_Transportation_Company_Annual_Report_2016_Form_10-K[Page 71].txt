The increase in the combined expense was primarily due to growth in tractors and trailers in ourfleet from December
31, 2014 to December 31 , 2015. See consolidated table of revenue equipment within "Executive Summary," above.
Higher revenue equipment replacement costs additionally contributed to the increase in the expense. As a
percentage of Revenue XFSR, rental expense and depreciation and amortization of property and equipment
remained relatively consistent from 2014 to 2015.

In 2015, we accelerated the average trade-in cycle for our tractors. As we added newer tractors to our fleet during
2015, we sold the older models (including a few large sales transactions in the fourth quarter of 2015), contributing
to the increase in gain on disposal of revenue equipment, compared to 2014. We did not sell any facilities in 2015.
In the third quarter of 2014, we recognized gains on the sale of two redundant facilities associated with the Central
Acquisition, resulting in a gain of $3.0 million.
