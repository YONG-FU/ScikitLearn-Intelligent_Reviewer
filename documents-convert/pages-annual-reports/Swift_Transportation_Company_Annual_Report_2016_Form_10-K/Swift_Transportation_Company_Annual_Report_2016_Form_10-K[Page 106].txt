(1) Dames,ZZQECQdLLQUQQAQ[[IZZilQScQQdLiCﬂQU — Internal Revenue Code Section 199 permits taxpayers to claim a
deduction from taxable income attributable to certain domestic production activities such as the development
of computer software and the manufacturing of goods. Beginning in 2010 and thereafter, the deduction is equal
to 9% of the smaller of a taxpayer's qualified production activities or taxable income. Due to its increased
software development efforts, the Company has elected to take the deduction in the current year and preceding
open tax years. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was partially
attributable to a domestic production activities deduction on the Company's 2015 federal tax return. The
Company also received tax benefits for years ending December 31 , 2016, December 31 , 2014, and December
31 , 201 3. The Company generated $6.4 million, $6.2 million, $6.2 million, and $3.4 million in domestic production
activities deductions for the development of computer software in 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
This resulted in approximately $2.2 million, $2.2 million, $2.2 million, and $1.2 million in tax benefits in 2016,
2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
(2) IQiL/goadsiincameiiaxicredii — Trans-Mex, our Mexico trucking subsidiary, qualified for an income tax credit
equal to 50% of the qualified tolls paid. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December
31, 2016 was partially attributable to the toll road income tax credit reported on the 2015 income tax return.
Trans-Mex also will claim a toll road income tax credit for 2016. Trans-Mex paid $5.6 million and $6.5 million
in qualifying tolls during 2016 and 2015, respectively. This resulted in approximately $1.8 million and $2.3
million in tax benefits in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
