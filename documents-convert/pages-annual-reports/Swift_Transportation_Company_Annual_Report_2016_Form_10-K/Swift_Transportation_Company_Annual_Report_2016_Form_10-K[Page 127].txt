awards provide each grantee a number of shares of Swift's Class A common stock at the end of a three-year period,
based on certain performance criteria established by the compensation committee of the Board. The performance
criteria are designed to focus management's attention on the Company's key long-term financial goals, and are

Non-compensatory Stock Plan: E SF]?
in 2012, the Company's Board adopted and its stockholders approved the Swift Transportation Company 2012
ESPP. The 2012 ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code and is considered
noncompensatory. Pursuant to the 2012 ESPP, the Company is authorized to issue up to 2.0 million shares of its
Class A common stock to eligible employees who participate in the plan. Employees are eligible to participate in
the 2012 ESPP following at least 90 days of employment with the Company or any of its participating subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the 2012 ESPP, eligible employees may elect to purchase common stock through payroll
deductions, not to exceed 15% of their gross cash compensation. The purchase price of the common stock is 95%
of the common stock's fair market value quoted on the NYSE on the last trading day of each offering period. There
are four three-month offering periods corresponding to the calendar quarters. Each eligible employee is restricted
to purchasing a maximum of $6,250 of common stock during an offering period, determined by the fair market value
of the common stock as of the first day of the offering period, and $25,000 of common stock during a calendar year.
Employees who own 5% or more of the total voting power or value of all classes of common stock are restricted
from participating in the 2012 ESPP.
