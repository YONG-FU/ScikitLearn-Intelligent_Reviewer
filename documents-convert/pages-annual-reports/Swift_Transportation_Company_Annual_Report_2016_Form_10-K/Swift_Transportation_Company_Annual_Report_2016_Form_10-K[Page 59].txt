Dedicated Revenue —The increase in operating revenue for 2016, as compared to 2015, included a $28.1 million
decrease in fuel surcharge revenue, due to lowerfuel prices, more than offset by a $71.6 million increase in Revenue
xFSR. The 8.4% increase in Revenue XFSR includes the following:
- 7.7% increase in weekly Revenue xFSR per tractor from improved pricing and freight mix, and a
- 0.4% increase in average operational truck count.
The Dedicated segment's leadership team has sustained its performance in delivering improvements in fleet
efficiency, pricing, and underperforming accounts which contributed to the increase in weekly Revenue xFSR per
tractor.
Dedicated Operating Income — Operating income increased for 2016, as compared to 2015, which was primarily
driven by the increase in Revenue xFSR, discussed above. Other factors that affected operating income are
discussed within "Dedicated Adjusted Operating Ratio," below.
Dedicated Adjusted Operating Ratio — Adjusted Operating Ratio decreased 200 basis points for 2016, as
compared to 2015. This was primarily driven by the increase in Revenue XFSR, discussed above, as well as the
segment's continued focus on improving cost control. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in
driver salaries, wages, and employee benefits, primarily due to the company driver wage increases implemented
in 2015 and an increase in group health insurance expense. Additionally, rent and depreciation expenses were
higher, and gains on disposals of property and equipment were lower due to the soft used truck market.
