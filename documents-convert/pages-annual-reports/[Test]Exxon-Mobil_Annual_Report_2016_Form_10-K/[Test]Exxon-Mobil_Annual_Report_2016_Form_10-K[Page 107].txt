NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
20. Subsequent Events
The Corporation completed the acquisition of InterOil Corporation (IOC) for about $2.5 billion on February 22, 2017 . IOC is an
exploration and production business focused on Papua New Guinea. Consideration includes around 28 million shares of Exxon
Mobil Corporation common stock with an estimated value of $2.3 billion, a Contingent Resource Payment (CRP) and cash. The
CRP provides IOC shareholders $7.07 per share in cash for each incremental certified Trillion Cubic Feet Equivalent (TCFE) of
resources above 6.2 TCFE, and up to 11.0 TCFE. IOCâ€™s assets include a receivable related to the same resource base for volumes
in excess of 3.5 TCFE at amounts ranging from $0.24 - $0.40 per thousand cubic feet equivalent. The receivable is expected to
more than cover the CRP.
On January 16, 2017, an affiliate of the Corporation entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with the Bass family of Fort
Worth, Texas, to acquire companies that indirectly own certain oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin and certain additional
properties and related assets in exchange for shares of Exxon Mobil Corporation common stock having an aggregate value at the
time of closing of $5.6 billion, together with additional contingent cash payments tied to future drilling and completion activities
(up to a maximum of $1.02 billion). The transaction is currently expected to close on or about February 28, 2017. As of
January 16, 2017, the number of shares issuable in connection with the transaction would have been approximately 63 million.
