(2) For 2016 and 2015, other postretirement beneﬁts paid are net of $22 million and $15 million of Medicare subsidy receipts,
respectively.
For selection of the discount rate for U.S. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest rate market
indicators and the discount rate determined by use of a yield curve based on high-quality, noncallable bonds with cash ﬂows that
match estimated outﬂows for benefit payments. For major non-U.S. plans, the discount rate is determined by using bond
portfolios with an average maturity approximating that of the liabilities or spot yield curves, both of which are constructed using
high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds.
The measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5 percent in
2018 and subsequent years. A one-percentage-point increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase service and interest
cost by $76 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $862 million. A one—percentage-point decrease in the health care
cost trend rate would decrease service and interest cost by $58 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $687 million.
