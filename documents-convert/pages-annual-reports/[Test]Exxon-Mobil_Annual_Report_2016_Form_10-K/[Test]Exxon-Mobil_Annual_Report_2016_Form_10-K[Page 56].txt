This table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold
shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with similar
pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to
purchase refinery products at market prices. Inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in assessing liquidity and
cash ﬂow, because these purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. The
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2016, because the Corporation is unable to
make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Further details on the
unrecognized tax benefits can be found in “Note 19: Income, Sales-Based and Other Taxes”.
Notes:
(1) Includes capitalized lease obligations of $1 ,225 million.
(2) The amount due in one year is included in notes and loans payable of $1 3, 83 0 million.
(3) The fair value of asset retirement obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of ﬁeld life.
(4) The amount by which the beneﬁt obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain US. and non-US. pension and
other postretirement plans at year-end. The payments by period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in
201 7 and estimated beneﬁt payments for unfunded plans in all years.
(5) Mnimum commitments for operating leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers, service
stations and other properties. Total includes $836 million related to drilling rigs and related equipment.
(6) T ake-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase
obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that
third parties have used to secure ﬁnancing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. The
undiscounted obligations of $21 ,5 80 million mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements.
(7) Firm capital commitments represent legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements speciﬁ/ing all
significant terms have been executed for the construction and purchase of ﬁxed assets and other permanent investments. In
certain cases where the Corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope, those commitments have
been included to the extent that the amounts and timing of payments can be reliably estimated. Firm capital commitments,
shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled $10.4 billion, including $2.8 billion in the US. Firm capital commitments for the
non-US. Upstream of $6.9 billion were primarily associated with projects in the United Arab Emirates, Africa, Malaysia,
Canada, Australia and Norway. The Corporation expects to fund the majority of these commitments with internally
generated funds, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt.
