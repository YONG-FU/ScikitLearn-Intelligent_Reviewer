NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
15. Incentive Program
The 2003 Incentive Program provides for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and other
forms of award. Awards may be granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned.
Outstanding awards are subject to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. Options and SARs
may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. The
maximum number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 Incentive Program is 220 million. Awards that are
forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against this maximum limit. The 2003 Incentive Program does not have a
specified term. New awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the Board terminates the plan early. At
the end of 2016, remaining shares available for award under the 2003 Incentive Program were 93 million.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. Awards totaling 9,583 thousand, 9,681 thousand, and 9,775 thousand of restricted
(nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Compensation expense for these awards is
based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite service period. Shares for these
awards are issued to employees from treasury stock. The units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their changes
in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. During the applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold
or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. The majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares
and units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven years. Awards granted to a
small number of senior executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or retirement,
whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award.
The Corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated transactions to offset shares or units settled in
shares issued in conjunction with benefit plans and programs. Purchases may be discontinued at any time without prior notice.
