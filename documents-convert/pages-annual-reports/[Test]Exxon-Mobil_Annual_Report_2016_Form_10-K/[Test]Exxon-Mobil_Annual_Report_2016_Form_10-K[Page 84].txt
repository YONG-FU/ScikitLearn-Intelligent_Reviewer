NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Asset Retirement Obligations
The Corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. The fair values of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on
a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets are installed. In the estimation of fair value, the Corporation uses
assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements; discount rates; and inï¬‚ation rates. Asset
retirement obligations incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements. The costs associated with these
liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. Over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value.
Asset retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are
permanently shut down and dismantled. These obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation.
However, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the fair value of the
conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.
