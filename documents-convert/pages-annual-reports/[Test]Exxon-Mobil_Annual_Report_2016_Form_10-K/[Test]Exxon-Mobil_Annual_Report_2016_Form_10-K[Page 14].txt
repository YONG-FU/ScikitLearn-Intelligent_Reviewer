Average production prices have been calculated by using sales quantities from the Corporation’s own production as the divisor.
Average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the divisor. The volumes of crude oil and
natural gas liquids (N GL) production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section 3.A. The
volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in
section 3A. The natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in the reserves table in the “Oil and Gas
Reserves” part of the “Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities” portion of the Financial
Section of this report due to volumes consumed or ﬂared. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at siX million cubic feet per
one thousand barrels.
