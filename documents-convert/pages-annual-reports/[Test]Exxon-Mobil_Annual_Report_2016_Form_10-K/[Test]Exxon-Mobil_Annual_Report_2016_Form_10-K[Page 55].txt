was offset by reductions for distributions to ExxonMobil shareholders of $12.5 billion, all in the form of dividends. Foreign
exchange translation effects of $0.3 billion for the stronger US. currency reduced equity, while a $1.6 billion change in the
funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.
