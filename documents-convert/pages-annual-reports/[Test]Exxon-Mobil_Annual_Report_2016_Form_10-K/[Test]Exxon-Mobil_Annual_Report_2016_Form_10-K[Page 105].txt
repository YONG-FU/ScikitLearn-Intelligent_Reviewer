Corporation early-adopted Accounting Standard Update no. 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of
Deferred Taxes on a prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as
current and noncurrent, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classiﬁed as noncurrent.

The Corporation had $54 billion of indefinitely reinvested, undistributed earnings from subsidiary companies outside the US. that
were retained to fund prior and future capital project expenditures. Deferred taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax
obligations as these earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2016, it is
not practical to estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings given the future availability of
foreign tax credits and uncertainties about the timing of potential remittances.
