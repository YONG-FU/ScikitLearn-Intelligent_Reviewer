Return on Average Capital Employed
Return on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments,
ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of—year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent
with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable
to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation
has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as the best measure of historical capital productivity in
our capital-intensive, long-term industry, both to evaluate management’s performance and to demonstrate to shareholders that
capital has been used wisely over the long term. Additional measures, which are more cash ﬂow based, are used to make
investment decisions.
