NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
10. Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Well Costs
The Corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well and the Corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project. The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different
activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
The following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging
summary of those costs.
Change in capitalized suspended exploratory well costs:
2016 2015 2014
(millions of dollars)
Balance beginning at January 1 4,372 3,587 2,707
Additions pending the determination of proved reserves 180 847 1,095
Charged to expense (111) (5) (28)
Reclassifications to wells, facilities and equipment based on the
determination of proved reserves - (43) (160)
Divestments/Other 36 (14) (27)
Ending balance at December 31 : 4,477 4,372 3,5 87:
Ending balance attributed to equity companies included above 707 696 645
Period end capitalized suspended exploratory well costs:
2016 2015 2014
(millions of dollars)
Capitalized for a period of one year or less 180 847 1,095
Capitalized for a period of between one and five years 2,981 2,386 1,659
Capitalized for a period of between five and ten years 911 826 544
Capitalized for a period of greater than ten years 405 313 289
Capitalized for a period greater than one year - subtotal 4,297 3,525 2,492
Total : 4,477 4,372 3,587:
Exploration activity often involves drilling multiple wells, over a number of years, to fully evaluate a project. The table below
provides a breakdown of the number of projects with suspended exploratory well costs which had their first capitalized well
drilled in the preceding 12 months and those that have had exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than 12 months,
which includes the Rosneft joint venture exploration activity (refer to the relevant portion of Note 7).
2016 2015 2014
Number of projects with first capitalized well drilled in the preceding 12 months 2 4 8
Number of projects that have exploratory well costs capitalized for a period
of greater than 12 months 58 55 53
Total : 60 5 9 6 1 :
Of the 58 projects that have exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than 12 months as of December 31, 2016,
16 projects have drilling in the preceding 12 months or exploratory activity either planned in the next two years or subject to
sanctions. The remaining 42 projects are those with completed exploratory activity progressing toward development.
