The Corporation’s investment strategy for benefit plan assets reﬂects a long-term view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent
in various asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. The benefit plan assets are primarily invested
in passive equity and fixed income index funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. The equity funds hold ExxonMobil stock
only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. The fixed income funds are largely invested in high-quality
corporate and government debt securities.
Studies are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation percentages. The target asset allocation for the
US. benefit plans and the major non-U.S. plans is 40 percent equity securities and 60 percent debt securities. The equity targets
for the US. and non-U.S. plans include an allocation to private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture
capital of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
The fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different methods of valuing assets. The terms do not
represent the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.
