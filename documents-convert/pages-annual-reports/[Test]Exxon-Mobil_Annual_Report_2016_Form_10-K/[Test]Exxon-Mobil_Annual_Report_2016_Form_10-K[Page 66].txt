MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Foreign Currency Translation
The method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into US.

functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects
the functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.
Factors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash
ﬂows related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of
inﬂation in the country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor;
services and supplies; sources of financing; and significance of intercompany transactions.
