B. Exploratory and Development Activities Regarding Oil and Gas Resources Extracted by Mining Technologies
Syncrude Operations. Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining
methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic
crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a
69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited. In 2016, the company’s share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about
67 thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 63 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to
extract the crude bitumen. Imperial Oil Limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada
Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a
100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand
acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.
Kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced
from open-pit mining operations, and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of
bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light
hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2016, average net production at
Kearl was about 167 thousand barrels per day.
As a result of very low prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen
at Kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being
recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs,
and / or operating efficiencies.

B. Review of Principal Ongoing Activities
UNITED STATES
ExxonMobil’s year-end 2016 acreage holdings totaled 12.9 million net acres, of which 1.0 million net acres were offshore.
ExxonMobil was active in areas onshore and offshore in the lower 48 states and in Alaska.
During the year, 442.3 net development wells were completed in the inland lower 48 states. Development activities focused on
liquids-rich opportunities in the onshore U.S., primarily in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and the Bakken oil
play in North Dakota. In addition, gas development activities continued in the Marcellus Shale of Pennsylvania and West
Virginia, the Utica Shale of Ohio and the Haynesville Shale of East Texas and Louisiana.
