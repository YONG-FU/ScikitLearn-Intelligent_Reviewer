Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows
As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash ﬂows is
computed by applying first-day-of—the-month average prices, year-end costs and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent to net proved reserves. The standardized measure includes costs for future dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation
obligations. The Corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected
future cash ﬂows to be obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its proved oil
and gas reserves. The standardized measure is prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of—the-
month average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause significant variability in cash ﬂows from
year to year as prices change.
