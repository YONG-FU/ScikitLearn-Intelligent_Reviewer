18. Disclosures about Segments and Related Information
The Upstream, Downstream and Chemical functions best define the operating segments of the business that are reported
separately. The factors used to identify these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are undertaken by
each segment. The Upstream segment is organized and operates to explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. The
Downstream segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. The Chemical segment is organized
and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. These segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and
petrochemical industries.
These functions have been defined as the operating segments of the Corporation because they are the segments (1) that engage in
business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred, (2) whose operating results are regularly reviewed
by the Corporation’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to
assess its performance, and (3) for which discrete financial information is available.
Earnings after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.
