NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The funding levels of all qualified pension plans are in compliance with standards set by applicable law or regulation. As shown
in the table below, certain smaller U.S. pension plans and a number of non-U.S. pension plans are not funded because local
applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. All defined benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength of the Corporation or the
respective sponsoring affiliate.

The authoritative guidance for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires an employer to recognize the
overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial
position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive
income.
