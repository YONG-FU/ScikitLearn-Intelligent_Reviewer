NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The long—term expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each benefit plan by developing a
forward—looking, long—term return assumption for each asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for
the specific asset class and inﬂation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target
asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.
