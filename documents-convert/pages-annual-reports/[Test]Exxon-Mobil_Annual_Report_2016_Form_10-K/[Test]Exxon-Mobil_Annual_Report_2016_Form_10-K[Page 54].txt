MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Capital and exploration
expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, reﬂecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program. The Corporation
anticipates an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. The Corporation is emerging from several years of high capital expenditure
levels that supported major long-plateau production projects coming on line. Lower levels of capital spending over the next few
years, partly due to cost savings and capital efﬁciencies, are not expected to delay major project schedules nor have a material
effect on our volume capacity outlook.
Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a
large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and
technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash ﬂow. Further, due to its financial strength, debt
capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a
significant impact on the Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash ﬂows for operations and its fixed
commitments.
