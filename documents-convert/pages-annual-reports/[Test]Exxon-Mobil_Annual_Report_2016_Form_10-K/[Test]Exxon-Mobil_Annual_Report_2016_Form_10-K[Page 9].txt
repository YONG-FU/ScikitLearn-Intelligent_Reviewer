1. Disclosure of Reserves
A. Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-End 2016
The table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. Gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.
The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-theâ€”month price for each month
during the last 12-month period. As a result of very low prices during 2016, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain
quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end
2016. Among the factors that would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future
are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Otherwise, no major discovery or
other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2016, that would cause a significant change in the estimated
proved reserves as of that date.
