13. Financial Instruments and Derivatives
Financial Instruments. The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and other
valuation techniques as appropriate. The only category of financial instruments where the difference between fair value and
recorded book value is notable is long-term debt. The estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized lease
obligations, was $28.0 billion and $18.9 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as compared to recorded book
values of $27.7 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair value
and book value of long-term debt reﬂects the Corporation’s issuance of $12.0 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of
2016.
The fair value of long-term debt by hierarchy level at December 31, 2016, is: Level 1 $27,825 million; Level 2 $137 million; and
Level 3 $6 million.
Derivative Instruments. The Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of
the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates,
currency rates and commodity prices. As a result, the Corporation makes limited use of derivatives to mitigate the impact of such
changes. The Corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use
derivatives with leveraged features. When the Corporation does enter into derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures
associated with interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets, liabilities
and forecasted transactions.
The estimated fair value of derivative instruments outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet was a net liability of $22 million
at year-end 2016 and a net asset of $21 million at year-end 2015. Assets and liabilities associated with derivatives are usually
recorded either in “Other current assets” or “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities”.
The Corporation’s fair value measurement of its derivative instruments use either Level 1 or Level 2 inputs.
The Corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss) related to derivative instruments of $(81) million, $39 million and
$110 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income statement effects associated with derivatives are usually recorded
either in “Sales and other operating revenue” or “Crude oil and product purchases”.
The Corporation believes there are no material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations
or liquidity as a result of the derivative activities described above.
