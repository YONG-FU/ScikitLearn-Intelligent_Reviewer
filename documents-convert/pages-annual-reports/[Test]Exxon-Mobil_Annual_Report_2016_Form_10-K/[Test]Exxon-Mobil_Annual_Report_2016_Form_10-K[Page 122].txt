(1) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules require the Corporation ’s reserves to be calculated on the basis of
average ﬁrst-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. As a result of very low prices during 2016, under
the SEC deﬁnition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualiﬁed as proved reserves in prior
years did not qualiﬁ/ as proved reserves at year-end 2016. Future net cash ﬂows for these quantities are excluded from the
2016 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Cash Flows. Substantially all of this reduction in discounted future net
cash ﬂows since December 31, 2015, is reﬂected in the line “Net change in prices, lifting and development costs ” in the table
above.
