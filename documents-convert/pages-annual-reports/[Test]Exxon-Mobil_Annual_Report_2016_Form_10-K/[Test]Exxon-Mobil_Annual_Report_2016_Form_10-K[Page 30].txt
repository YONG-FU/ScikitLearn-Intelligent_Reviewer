ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On December 8, 2016, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) contacted the Corporation concerning alleged
violations of the Texas Clean Air Act, certain implementing regulations, and the applicable new source review permit in
connection with exceedances of the nitrogen oxide emission limit at a compressor engine and volatile organic compound emission
limits at Tanks 21 and 23 at the Corporation’s former King Ranch Gas Plant. The TCEQ is seeking a civil penalty in excess of
$100,000, and the Corporation is working with the TCEQ to resolve the matter.
As reported in the Corporation’s Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2014, on May 20, 2014, the TCEQ issued a
Notice of Enforcement and Proposed Agreed Order (the Agreed Order) alleging that record reviews and inspections at
ExxonMobil Oil Corporation’s (EMOC) Beaumont, Texas, refinery in 2013 and 2014, identified deficiencies in the refinery’s
cooling tower monitoring activities and one air emission event, which allegedly violated provisions of the Texas Health and
Safety Code, the Texas Water Code, and the Code of Federal Regulations. Additionally, the TCEQ identiﬁed deficiencies in a
refinery continuous emissions monitoring system relative accuracy test audit procedure. On November 8, 2016, the TCEQ
formally approved and signed the Agreed Order. EMOC previously paid the agreed $100,430 fine to the TCEQ, and on
November 28, 2016, EMOC made a $100,429 payment for the benefit of the Southeast Texas Regional Planning Commission for
the Meteorological and Air Monitoring Network Project, thereby satisfying all remaining financial obligations under the Agreed
Order and concluding this matter.
