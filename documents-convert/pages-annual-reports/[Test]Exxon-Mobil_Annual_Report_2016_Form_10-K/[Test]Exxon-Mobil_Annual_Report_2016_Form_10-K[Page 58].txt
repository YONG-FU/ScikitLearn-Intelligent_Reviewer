(1) Exploration expenses included.
Capital and exploration expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and
produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy. The Corporation anticipates an investment level of
$22 billion in 2017. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
Upstream spending of $14.5 billion in 2016 was down 43 percent from 2015, reﬂecting key project start-ups and capital
efficiencies. Investments in 2016 included U.S. onshore drilling and world-class projects in Kazakhstan, Canada and Australia.
The majority of expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two to four years from the time of recording
proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 69 percent of total
proved reserves at year-end 2016, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.
Capital investments in the Downstream totaled $2.5 billion in 2016, a decrease of $0.2 billion from 2015, mainly reﬂecting lower
refining project spending. Chemical capital expenditures of $2.2 billion decreased $0.6 billion from 2015 resulting from
progression of major expansions.

earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, favorable one-time items, and the impact of the US. Upstream impairment charge.
