NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Unrecognized Tax Beneﬁts. The Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world.
Unrecognized tax benefits reﬂect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax returns and the
amounts recognized in the financial statements. The following table summarizes the movement in unrecognized tax benefits:
Gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts 2016 2015 2014
(millions of dollars)
Balance at January 1 9,396 8,986 7,838
Additions based on current year's tax positions 655 903 1,454
Additions for prior years' tax positions 534 496 448
Reductions for prior years' tax positions (1,019) (190) (532)
Reductions due to lapse of the statute of limitations (7) (4) (117)
Settlements with tax authorities (70) (725) (43)
Foreign exchange effects/other (21) (70) (62)
Balance at December 31 : 9,468 9,396 8,986:
The gross unrecognized tax benefit balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would reduce the
Corporation’s effective tax rate if the positions are favorably resolved. Unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally
would not increase the effective tax rate. The 2016, 2015 and 2014 changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material
effect on the Corporation’s net income.
Resolution of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities or through litigation will take many years
to complete. It is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not entirely within the control of
the Corporation. In the United States, the Corporation has various ongoing US. federal income tax positions at issue with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years beginning in 2006. The IRS has asserted penalties associated with several of those
positions. The Corporation has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the Corporation does not expect the penalties
to be sustained under applicable law. The Corporation has filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a US. federal district
court with respect to the positions at issue for those years. Unfavorable resolution of all positions at issue with the IRS would not
have a materially adverse effect on the Corporation’s net income or liquidity.
It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could change in the next 12 months in a range from a
decrease of 10 percent to an increase of up to 15 percent, with no material impact on the Corporation’s net income.

penalties as operating expense.
