NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
2. Accounting Changes
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Revenue ﬁom Contracts with Customers. The
standard establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry specific
requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. The standard is required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2018. “Sales and
Other Operating Revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales
transactions. When the Corporation adopts the standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. This change in reporting will not impact earnings. The Corporation expects to adopt the standard using the Modiﬁed
Retrospective method, under which prior years’ results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of the new
standard is provided for 2018 results. The Corporation continues to evaluate other areas of the standard which are not expected to
have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial statements.
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard, Leases. The standard requires that all leases
with an initial term greater than one year be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and a lease liability. The standard is
required to be adopted beginning January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. ExxonMobil is evaluating the standard and its
effect on the Corporation’s financial statements and plans to adopt it in 2019.
Effective September 30, 2016, the Corporation early-adopted Accounting Standard Update no. 2015-l7 Income Taxes (Topic
740): Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes on a prospective basis. This update eliminates the requirement to classify
deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be
classified as noncurrent. See Note 19.
