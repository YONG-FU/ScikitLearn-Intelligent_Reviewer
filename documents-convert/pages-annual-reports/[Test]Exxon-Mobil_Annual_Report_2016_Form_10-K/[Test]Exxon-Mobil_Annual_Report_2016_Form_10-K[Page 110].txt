Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Costs
The amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated subsidiaries are $15,239 million less at year-end 2016 and
$14,685 million less at year-end 2015 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant and equipment for the
Upstream in Note 9. This is due to the exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets and assets
relating to LNG operations. Assets related to oil sands and oil shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board rules.
