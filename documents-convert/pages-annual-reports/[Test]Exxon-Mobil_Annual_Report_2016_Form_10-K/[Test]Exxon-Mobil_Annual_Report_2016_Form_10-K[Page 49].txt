2016
Upstream earnings were $196 million in 2016 and included an asset impairment charge of $2,027 million mainly related to dry
gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountains region of the US. Current year earnings were down
$6,905 million from 2015. Lower realizations decreased earnings by $5.3 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased
earnings by $130 million. The impairment charge reduced earnings by $2 billion. All other items increased earnings by
$310 million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items from the prior year. On an oil
equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day was down slightly compared to 2015. Liquids production of 2.4 million
barrels per day increased 20,000 barrels per day with increased project volumes, mainly in Canada, Indonesia and Nigeria, partly
offset by field decline, the impact from Canadian wildfires, and downtime notably in Nigeria. Natural gas production of
10.1 billion cubic feet per day decreased 388 million cubic feet per day from 2015 as field decline, regulatory restrictions in the
Netherlands and divestments were partly offset by higher project volumes and work programs. U.S. Upstream earnings declined
$3,072 million from 2015 to a loss of $4,151 million, and included the impairment charge of $2,027 million. Earnings outside the
US. were $4,347 million, down $3,833 million from the prior year.
2015
Upstream earnings were $7,101 million, down $20,447 million from 2014. Lower realizations decreased earnings by
$18.8 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $810 million, including contributions from new
developments. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion, primarily due to lower asset management gains and
approximately $500 million of lower favorable one-time tax effects, partly offset by lower expenses of about $230 million. On an
oil-equivalent basis, production of 4.1 million barrels per day was up 3.2 percent compared to 2014. Liquids production of
2.3 million barrels per day increased 234,000 barrels per day, with project ramp-up and entitlement effects partly offset by field
decline. Natural gas production of 10.5 billion cubic feet per day decreased 630 million cubic feet per day from 2014 as
regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by project ramp-up, work programs and entitlement
effects. U.S. Upstream earnings declined $6,276 million from 2014 to a loss of $1,079 million in 2015. Earnings outside the US.
were $8,180 million, down $14,171 million from the prior year.
