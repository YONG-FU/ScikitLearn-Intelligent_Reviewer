NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
7. Equity Company Information
The summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain less-than—majority-owned companies and
majority-owned subsidiaries where minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant management decisions (see
Note 1). These companies are primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in North
America; natural gas exploration, production and distribution in Europe; and exploration, production, liquefied natural gas (LNG)
operations, reﬁning operations, petrochemical manufacturing, and fuel sales in Asia and the Middle East. Also included are
several refining, petrochemical manufacturing, and marketing ventures.
The Corporation’s ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in
partnerships. Differences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net
assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to speciﬁc assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the
factors giving rise to the difference. The amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in “income from equity
affiliates”.
The share of total equity company revenues from sales to ExxonMobil consolidated companies was 14 percent, 15 percent and
14 percent in the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
In 2013 and 2014, the Corporation and Rosneft established various entities to conduct exploration and research activities. Periods
of disproportionate funding will result in the Corporation recognizing, during the early phases of the projects, an investment that
is larger than its equity share in these entities. These joint ventures are considered Variable Interest Entities. However, since the
Corporation is not the primary beneﬁciary of these entities, the joint ventures are reported as equity companies. In 2014, the
European Union and United States imposed sanctions relating to the Russian energy sector. With respect to the foregoing, each
joint venture continues to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Corporation's maximum before-tax
exposure to loss from these joint ventures as of December 31, 2016, is $1.0 billion.
