FREQUENTLY USED TERMS
Listed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions are
provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
Cash Flow From Operations and Asset Sales
Cash ﬂow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds associated with
sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows. This cash ﬂow reﬂects the total sources of cash from both operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting
of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that all assets are
contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are
worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for
investment in the business and ﬁnancing activities, including shareholder distributions.

Capital Employed
Capital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses,
it includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term
and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes
ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity
companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.
