Total cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2016, essentially in line with the prior year. The major sources of
funds in 2016 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of
$22.3 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.3 billion, and a net debt increase of $4.3 billion. The
major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $16.2 billion, dividends to shareholders
of $12.5 billion, the adjustment for non-cash deferred income tax credits of $4.4 billion, and a change in working capital,
excluding cash and debt, of $1.4 billion.
Total cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2015, $1.0 billion lower than the prior year. The major sources of
funds in 2015 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of
$18.0 billion for depreciation and depletion, and a net debt increase of $9.3 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for
additions to property, plant and equipment of $26.5 billion, the purchase of shares of ExxonMobil stock of $4.0 billion, dividends
to shareholders of $12.1 billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.1 billion.
The Corporation has access to signiﬁcant capacity of long—term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected
to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2016, the
Corporation had unused committed short-term lines of credit of $5.5 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of
$0.3 billion. Cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the Corporation’s immediate needs is carefully managed
through counterparty quality and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet the Corporation’s cash
requirements and to optimize returns.
To support cash ﬂows in future periods the Corporation will need to continually find and develop new fields, and continue to
develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a
period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the remainder
of their economic life. Averaged over all the Corporation’s existing oil and gas fields and without new projects, ExxonMobil’s
production is expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the next few years. Decline rates can
vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, ﬂuid properties,
recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. Furthermore, the Corporation’s net interest in production for individual
fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.
The Corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in
quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years
providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual
project start-ups; operational outages, reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery proj ects; regulatory changes;
the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales, weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; and changes
in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. The Corporation’s cash
ﬂows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for a more complete
discussion of risks.
