Continued weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak financial results for several assets in
North America, and a reduction in the mid-point of the ranges of the Corporation’s long-term oil and natural gas prices developed
as part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle led the Corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances supported
performing an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets, notably North America natural gas assets and certain other
assets across the remainder of its Upstream operations. The assessment reﬂected long-term crude and natural gas prices which are
consistent with the mid-point of the ranges that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the range
of long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry experts and government agencies. This assessment indicated that
the vast majority of asset groups have future undiscounted cash ﬂow estimates exceeding carrying values. However, the carrying
values for certain asset groups in the United States exceeded the estimated cash ﬂows. As a result, the Corporation’s fourth
quarter 2016 results include a before-tax charge of $3.3 billion to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. The asset
groups subject to this impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States
with large undeveloped acreage positions. The impairment charge is recognized in the line “Depreciation and depletion” on the
Consolidated Statement of Income and recorded in “Accumulated depreciation and depletion”.
The assessment of fair values required the use of Level 3 inputs. The principal parameters used to establish fair values included
estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the average of third-party
industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8 percent
depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market transactions. Due to the inherent difficulty in
predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably
estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges related to the Corporation’s long-lived assets.
Accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $209,691 million at the end of 2016 and $195,732 million at the end of 2015.
Interest capitalized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $708 million, $482 million and $344 million, respectively.
