ExxonMobilâ€™s investment in developed and undeveloped acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. The
terms and conditions under which the Corporation maintains exploration and/or production rights to the acreage are
property-specific, contractually defined and vary significantly from property to property. Work programs are designed to ensure
that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before expiration. In some instances, the Corporation may elect to
relinquish acreage in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is complete and there is not a business
basis for extension. In cases where additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the Corporation has generally been
successful in obtaining extensions. The scheduled expiration of leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next
three years is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Corporation.
