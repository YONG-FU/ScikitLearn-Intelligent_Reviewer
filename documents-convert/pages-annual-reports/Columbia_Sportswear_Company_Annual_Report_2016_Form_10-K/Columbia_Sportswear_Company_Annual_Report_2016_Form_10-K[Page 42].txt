2014. Additionally, in 2015 we generated a higher proportion of taxable income in the United States where tax rates are
generally higher than in international jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital, investing activities associated with our global
direct-to-consumer expansion, ongoing ERP and complementary systems implementations, general corporate needs and
the expansion of our global operations. At December 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $551.4 million
compared to $369.8 million at December 31, 2015. In addition, we had short-term investments of $0.5 million at December
3 1, 2016 compared to $0.6 million at December 3 1, 2015. At December 3 1, 2016, approximately 49% of our cash and short-
term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries, from which repatriation of those funds to the United States would
likely result in a significant tax expense for us. However, based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations,
as well as the status of current tax law, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the United States. In addition,
our United States operations do not require the repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs.
