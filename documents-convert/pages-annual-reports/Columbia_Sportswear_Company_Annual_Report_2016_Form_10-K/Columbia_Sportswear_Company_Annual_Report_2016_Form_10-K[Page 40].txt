Net sales in the LAAP region decreased $22.4 million, or 5% (increased 2% constant-currency), to $469.2 million in
2015 from $491.6 million in 2014. The net sales decrease in the LAAP region was led by Korea, followed by Japan, partially
offset by net sales increases in our LAAP distributor business and China. The net sales decrease in Korea reﬂected business
weakness amid the extremely competitive outdoor sector in that country. The net sales decrease in Japan was negatively
affected by foreign currency exchange rates, which offset a net sales increase in local currency. The net sales increase in
our LAAP distributor business primarily reﬂected increased advance orders combined with a favorable shift in timing of
shipments.
Net sales in the EMEA region decreased $26.0 million, or 10% (remained ﬂat on constant-currency basis), to $233.2
million in 2015 from $259.2 million in 2014. The EMEA net sales decrease consisted of a decrease in our EMEA distributor
business, partially oﬁset by a net sales increase in our EMEA direct business. The EMEA distributor net sales decrease was
largely attributable to a decline in net sales to our Russian distributor as a result of challenging economic conditions.
Net sales in Canada increased $17.2 million, or 11% (30% constant-currency), to $168.6 million in 2015 from $151.4
million in 2014. The net sales increase in Canada reﬂected net sales increases in our wholesale and direct-to-consumer
businesses.

The net sales increase in 2015 compared to 2014 was led by the Columbia brand, followed by the prAna brand and
the SOREL brand, partially offset by lower Mountain Hardwear net sales. The Columbia brand net sales increase was led
by the United States, followed by Canada, partially offset by lower net sales in the EMEA and LAAP regions. The net sales
increase in the prAna brand, which was acquired on May 30, 2014, includes approximately $56.0 million of incremental
net sales for the first five months of 2015.
