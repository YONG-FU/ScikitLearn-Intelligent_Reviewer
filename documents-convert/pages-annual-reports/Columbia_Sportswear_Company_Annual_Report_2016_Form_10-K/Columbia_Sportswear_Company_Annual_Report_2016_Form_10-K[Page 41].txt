net sales increase in the Columbia brand, followed by the prAna brand, partially oﬁset by lower Mountain Hardwear brand

Gross Profit: Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 46. 1% in 2015 from 45.5% in 2014. Gross margin
expansion was primarily due to:
- Lower provisions for slow-moving inventory; and
- A more favorable channel mix due to a higher proportion of direct-to-consumer net sales and a lower proportion
of sales to independent international distributors, which carry lower gross margins than wholesale and direct-
to-consumer channels;
partially offset by:
° Unfavorable foreign currency hedge rates; and
- Lower margin on close-out product sales.
Our gross profit may not be comparable to other companies in our industry because some of these companies include
all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales while we, like many others, include these expenses as a
component of SG&A expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense: SG&A expense includes all costs associated with our design,
merchandising, marketing, distribution, and corporate functions, including related depreciation and amortization.
SG&A expense increased $68.9 million, or 9%, to $832.0 million, or 35. 8% of net sales, in 2015, from $763.1 million,
or 36.3% of net sales, in 2014. The SG&A expense increase was primarily due to:
- Increased personnel expenses to support business growth and strategic initiatives;
- Increased expenses relating to our expanding global direct-to-consumer channels;
- Increased operating costs associated with the inclusion of a full year of prAna expenses; and
- Increased demand creation investments;
partially offset by:
- Favorable foreign currency translation.
Depreciation and amortization included in SG&A expense totaled $55.5 million in 2015, compared to $49.2 million
in 2014.
Net Licensing Income: Net licensing income increased $1.2 million to $8.2 million in 2015, compared to $7.0
million in 2014. The increase in net licensing income was primarily due to increased licensing income from accessories
and equipment, including socks and backpacks, in the United States.
OtherNon-Operating Expense: Other non-operating expense totaled $2.8 million in 2015, compared to $0.3 million
in 2014. The increase in expense reﬂects net losses incurred on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities and net losses incurred on the settlement of foreign-currency denominated intercompany transactions during 20 15.
Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense increased to $67.5 million in 2015 from $56.7 million in 2014. Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 27.3% from 28.5% in 2014. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2015 was
primarily due to a tax benefit from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards and the release of associated valuation
allowances in certain international tax jurisdictions, as well as a benefit from the utilization of foreign tax credits. These
