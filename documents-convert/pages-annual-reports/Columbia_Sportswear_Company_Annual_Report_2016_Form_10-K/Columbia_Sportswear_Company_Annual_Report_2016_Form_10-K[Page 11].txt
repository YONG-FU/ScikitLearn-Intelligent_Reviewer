ownership of inventory and control over certain aspects of operations. Our direct-to-consumer businesses are designed to
elevate consumer perception of our brands, increase consumer and retailer awareness of and demand for our products, model
compelling retail environments for our products and strengthen emotional connections between consumers and our brands
over time. Our branded retail stores and e-commerce sites allow us to showcase a broad selection of products and to support
the brand's positioning with fixtures and imagery that may then be replicated and offered for use by our wholesale and
distributor customers. These stores and sites provide high visibility for our brands and products and help us to monitor the
needs and preferences of consumers. In addition, we operate outlet stores, which serve a role in our overall inventory
management by enabling us to profitably liquidate excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the
integrity of our brands in wholesale and distributor channels.
We operate in four geographic segments: (1) the United States, (2) Latin America and Asia Pacific ("LAAP"), (3)
Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and (4) Canada, which are reﬂective of our internal organization, management
and oversight structure. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development,
marketing, and distribution of outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories, and equipment. The following
