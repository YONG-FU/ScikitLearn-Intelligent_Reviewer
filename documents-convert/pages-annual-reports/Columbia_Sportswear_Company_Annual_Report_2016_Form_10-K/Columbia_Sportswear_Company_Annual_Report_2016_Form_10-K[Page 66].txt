Due to the potential for resolution of income tax audits currently in progress, and the expiration of various statutes of
limitation, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the twelve months following
December 31, 2016 by a range of zero to $4,410,000. Open tax years, including those previously mentioned, contain matters
that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, timing,
or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given examination cycle.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $7,723,000 and $9,358,000 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized at December
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The
Company recognized a net increase of accrued interest and penalties of $637,000 in 2016, and a net reversal of accrued
interest and penalties of $35 6,000 and $65,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company had $3,042,000 and $2,402,000 of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions at December
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
