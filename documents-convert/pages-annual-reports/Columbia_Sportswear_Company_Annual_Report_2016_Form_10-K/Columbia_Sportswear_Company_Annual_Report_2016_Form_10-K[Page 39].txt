Depreciation and amortization included in SG&A expense totaled $59.2 million in 2016, compared to $55.5 million
in 2015.
Net Licensing Income: Net licensing income increased $2.0 million to $10.2 million in 2016, compared to $8.2
million in 2015. The increase in net licensing income was primarily due to increased licensing income from accessories
and equipment in the United States.
OtherNon-Operating Expense: Other non-operating expense totaled $0.6 million in 2016, compared to $2.8 million
in 2015. The $2.2 million decrease in other non-operating expense was attributed to lower net losses incurred on the
revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, the change in fair value of foreign currency contracts not
designated as cash ﬂow hedges and the settlement of foreign-currency denominated transactions.
Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense decreased to $58.5 million in 2016 from $67.5 million in 2015. Our
effective income tax rate decreased to 22.8% from 27.3% in 2015. The decrease in our effective income tax rate was due
to a higher proportion of taxable income in foreign jurisdictions where tax rates are generally lower than the United States,
an increased income tax benefit from the utilization of foreign tax credits and an income tax benefit recognized as a result
of the company's early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-
Basea’ Payment Accounting. See Note 1 of the financial statements under Changes affecting comparability for further
discussion regarding the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. These comparative income tax benefits were partially offset by a
non-recurring tax benefit that was recognized in 2015 from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards and the
release of associated valuation allowances in certain international tax jurisdictions.

Net sales in the United States increased $256.8 million, or 21%, to $1,455.2 million in 2015 from $1,198.4 million
in 2014. The increase in net sales in the United States was led by an increase in net sales in our wholesale business, followed
by our direct-to-consumer businesses. The increase in our wholesale business was primarily the result of a net sales increase
in Columbia, SOREL and prAna brand net sales, and was driven by shipments of increased fall season advance orders. The
net sales increase in our direct-to-consumer business was led by increased net sales from our retail stores, followed by
increased e-commerce net sales. At December 31, 2015, we operated 111 retail stores, compared with 95 stores at December
31,2014.
