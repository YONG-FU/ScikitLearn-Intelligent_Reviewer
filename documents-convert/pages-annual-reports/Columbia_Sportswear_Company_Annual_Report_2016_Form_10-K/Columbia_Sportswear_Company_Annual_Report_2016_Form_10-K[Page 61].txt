NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS=(C0ntinued)
The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge the currency exchange rate risk of anticipated transactions
denominated in non-functional currencies that are designated and qualify as cash ﬂow hedges. The Company also uses
derivative instruments to economically hedge the currency exchange rate risk of certain investment positions, to hedge
balance sheet re-measurement risk and to hedge other anticipated transactions that do not qualify as cash ﬂow hedges. At
December 31, 2016, the Company's derivative contracts had a remaining maturity of less than two years. The maximum
net exposure to any single counterparty, which is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized gain of all contracts with
that counterparty, was less than $4,000,000 at December 31, 2016. All of the Company's derivative counterparties have
investment grade credit ratings. See Note 19 for further disclosures concerning derivatives.
Country and supplier concentrations
The Company's products are produced by contract manufacturers located outside the United States, principally in
Southeast Asia. Apparel is manufactured in approximately 17 countries, with Vietnam and China together accounting for
approximately 65% of 20 l 6 global apparel production. Footwear is manufactured in four countries, with China and Vietnam
accounting for substantially all of 2016 global footwear production. The five largest apparel factory groups accounted for
approximately 28% of 2016 global apparel production, with the largest factory group accounting for 10% of 2016 global
apparel production. The five largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately 73% of 2016 global footwear
production, with the largest factory group accounting for 34% of 2016 global footwear production. These companies,
however, have multiple factory locations, many of which are in different countries, thus reducing the risk that unfavorable
conditions at a single factory or location will have a material adverse effect on the Company.
