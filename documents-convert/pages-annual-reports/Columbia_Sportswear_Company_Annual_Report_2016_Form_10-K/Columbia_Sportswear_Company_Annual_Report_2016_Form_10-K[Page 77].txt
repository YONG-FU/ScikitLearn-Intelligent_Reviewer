NOTE 20—FAIR VALUE MEASURES
Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined
as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring
fair value as follows:
Level 1 — observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active liquid markets;
Level 2 — inputs, other than the quoted market prices in active markets, that are observable, either directly or
indirectly; or observable market prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions;
and
Level 3 — unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, that require the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions.
Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
