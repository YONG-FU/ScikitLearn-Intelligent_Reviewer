Stock Options
Options to purchase the Company's common stock are granted at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market
value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest and become exercisable ratably on an
annual basis over a period of four years and expire ten years from the date of the grant.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model. Key inputs and assumptions
used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award, the expected option term, expected
volatility of the Company's stock over the option's expected term, the risk-free interest rate over the option's expected term,
and the Company's expected annual dividend yield. The option's expected term is derived from historical option exercise
behavior and the option's terms and conditions, which the Company believes provide a reasonable basis for estimating an
expected term. The expected volatility is estimated based on observations of the Company's historical volatility over the
most recent term commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the US. Treasury yield
approximating the expected term. The dividend yield is based on the expected cash dividend payouts. Assumptions are
evaluated and revised as necessary to reﬂect changes in market conditions and the Company's experience. Estimates of fair
value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by people who receive equity awards.
