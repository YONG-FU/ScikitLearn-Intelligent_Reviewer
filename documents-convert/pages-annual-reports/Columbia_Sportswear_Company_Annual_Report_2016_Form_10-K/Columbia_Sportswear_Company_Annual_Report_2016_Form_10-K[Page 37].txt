Net sales in the United States increased $50.0 million, or 3%, to $1,505.2 million in 2016 from $1,455.2 million in
2015. The increase in net sales in the United States was led by an increase in net sales in our direct-to-consumer business,
partially offset by a decrease in our wholesale business. The increase in our direct-to-consumer business was led by increased
net sales from our retail stores, followed by increased e-commerce net sales. At December 31, 2016, we operated 118 retail
stores, compared with 111 stores at December 31, 2015. The net sales decrease in our wholesale business was primarily
driven by the impact of US. wholesale customer bankruptcies during 2016.
Net sales in the LAAP region decreased $15.5 million, or 3% (4% constant-currency), to $453.7 million in 2016 from
$469.2 million in 2015. The net sales decrease in the LAAP region was led by net sales decreases in Korea and our LAAP
distributor business, partially offset by net sales increases in Japan and China. The net sales decrease in Korea reﬂected a
change in consumer preferences in that country away from the outdoor category that has created an industry-wide excess
of inventory in that market. The net sales decrease in our LAAP distributor business primarily reﬂected a shift in timing of
shipments of spring advance orders. The net sales increase in Japan was driven by the positive effects of foreign exchange
rates, as nets sales in local currency were essentially unchanged.
Net sales in the EMEA region increased $20.3 million, or 9% (10% constant-currency), to $253.5 million in 2016
from $233.2 million in 2015. The EMEA net sales increase consisted of an increase in our EMEA direct business, partially
offset by a net sales decrease in our EMEA distributor business, reﬂecting a decline in net sales to our Russian distributor,
due to the macroeconomic challenges in that region.
Net sales in Canada decreased $4.0 million, or 2% (increased 1% constant-currency), to $164.6 million in 2016 from
$168.6 million in 2015. The net sales decrease in Canada reﬂected a net sales decrease in our wholesale business, partially
offset by a net sales increase in our direct-to-consumer business.
