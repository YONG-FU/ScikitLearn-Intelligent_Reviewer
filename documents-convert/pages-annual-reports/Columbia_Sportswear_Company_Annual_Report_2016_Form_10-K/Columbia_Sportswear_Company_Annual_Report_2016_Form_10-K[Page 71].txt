NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS=(Continued)
The fair value of service-based and performance-based restricted stock units is discounted by the present value of the
estimated future stream of dividends over the vesting period using the Black-Scholes model. The relevant inputs and
assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to compute the discount are the vesting period, expected annual dividend
yield and closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.
The following table presents the weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31:

Restricted stock unit compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $7,090,000,
$8,035,000 and $7,533,000, respectively. At December 31, 2016, unrecognized costs related to restricted stock units totaled
approximately $12,430,000, before any related tax benefit. The unrecognized costs related to restricted stock units are being
amortized over the related vesting period using the straight-line attribution method. These unrecognized costs at December
31, 2016 are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.94 years. The total grant date fair value of
restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $7,988,000, $6,848,000 and
$5,554,000, respectively.
NOTE 16—EARNIN GS PER SHARE
Earnings per share ("EPS ") is presented on both a basic and diluted basis. Basic EPS is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS reﬂects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted
EPS, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock
units determined using the treasury stock method.
