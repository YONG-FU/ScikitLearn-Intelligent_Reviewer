Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2016, the Company's internal control over financial reporting
is effective based on those criteria.
We are implementing an enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system and complementary systems that support our
operations and ﬁnancial reporting, which significantly aﬁect our business and financial transaction and reporting processes.
This implementation is occurring in phases globally over several years, with implementation to date at our North American
operations and independent international distributor businesses, excluding prAna, as well as the majority of our global
supply chain operations. Each implementation phase of our worldwide ERP system and complementary systems involves
changes to the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting. We are taking steps to monitor and
maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting and will continue to evaluate these controls for effectiveness.
There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
Our independent auditors have issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2016, which is included herein.
