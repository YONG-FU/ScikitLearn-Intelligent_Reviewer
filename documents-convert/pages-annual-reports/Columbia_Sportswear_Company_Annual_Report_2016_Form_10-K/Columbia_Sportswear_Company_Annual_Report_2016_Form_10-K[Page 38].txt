Net sales of apparel, accessories and equipment increased $44.2 million, or 2% (3% constant-currency), to $1,865 .4
million in 2016 from $1,821.2 million in 2015. The increase in apparel, accessories and equipment net sales was led by a
net sales increase in the Columbia brand, followed the prAna brand and the SOREL brand, partially offset by lower Mountain
Hardwear brand net sales. The apparel, accessories and equipment net sales increase was led by the United States, followed
by the EMEA region and Canada, partially offset by lower net sales in the LAAP region.
Net sales of footwear increased $6.6 million, or 1% ( 1% constant-currency), to $511.6 million in 2016 from $505.0
million in 2015. The increase in footwear net sales was led by the Columbia brand, followed by the SOREL brand. The
footwear net sales increase was led by the United States, followed by the EMEA region, partially offset by lower net sales
in Canada and the LAAP region.
Gross Proﬁt: Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 46.7% in 2016 from 46. 1% in 2015. Gross margin
expansion was primarily due to:
- Favorable changes in channel mix with a higher proportion of direct-to-consumer net sales and a lower proportion
of net sales to independent international distributors, which generally carry lower gross margins than wholesale
and direct-to-consumer channels;
- A favorable mix of full-price versus close-out product net sales;
° Selective price increases; and
- A favorable sourcing environment;
partially offset by:
- An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates in Canada, China, Europe, and Japan.
Our gross profit may not be comparable to other companies in our industry because some of these companies include
all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales while we, like many others, include these expenses as a
component of selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense: SG&A expense includes all costs associated with our design,
merchandising, marketing, distribution, and corporate functions, including related depreciation and amortization.
SG&A expense increased $32.1 million, or 4%, to $864.1 million, or 36.4% of net sales, in 2016, from $832.0 million,
or 35.8% of net sales, in 2015. The SG&A expense increase was primarily due to:
- Increased costs to support our expanding global direct-to-consumer channels;
- Increased personnel costs to support strategic initiatives and business growth; and
- Increased information technology investments;
partially offset by:
- Lower incentive compensation expenses;
° Cost containment measures that have been implemented throughout the year; and
- Lower demand creation expenses.
