incur additional costs, which may cause our customers to cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand a reduction
in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash ﬂows.
Reliance on contract manufacturers also creates quality control risks. Contract manufacturers may need to use sub-
contracted manufacturers to fulfill demand and these manufacturers may have less experience producing our products or
possess lower overall capabilities, which could result in compromised quality of our products. A failure in our quality control
program, or a failure of our contract manufacturers or their contractors to meet our quality control standards, may result in
diminished product quality, which in turn could result in increased order cancellations, price concessions and returns,
decreased consumer demand for our products, non-compliance with our product standards or regulatory requirements, or
product recalls (or other regulatory actions), any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations or cash ﬂows.
We also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products
using our trademarks. We impose standards of manufacturing practices on our contract manufacturers and licensees for the
benefit of workers and require compliance with our restricted substances list and product safety and other applicable
environmental, health and safety laws. We also require our contract manufacturers and licensees to impose these practices,
standards and laws on their contractors. If a contract manufacturer, licensee or subcontractor violates labor or other laws
or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as safe or ethical, the manufacturer, licensee or subcontractor or its
respective employees may suffer serious injury due to industrial accidents, the manufacturer may suﬁer disruptions to its
operations due to work stoppages or employee protests and we may experience production disruptions, lost sales or significant
negative publicity that could result in long-term damage to our reputation. In some circumstances, parties may assert that
we are liable for our independent manufacturers', licensees' or subcontractors’ labor and operational practices, which could
have a material adverse eﬁect on our brand image and our financial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows, in particular
if such assertions are successful.
We May Be Adversely Affected by Volatility in Global Production and Transportation Costs and Capacity
Our product costs are subject to substantial ﬂuctuation based on:
- Availability and quality of raw materials;
- The prices of oil, leather, natural down, cotton, and other raw materials whose prices are determined by global
commodity markets and can be very volatile;
- Changes in labor markets and wage rates paid by our independent factory partners, which are often mandated
by governments in the countries where our products are manufactured, particularly in China and Vietnam;
- Disruption to shipping and transportation channels utilized to bring our products to market;
- Interest rates and currency exchange rates;
- Availability of skilled labor and production capacity at contract manufacturers; and
° General economic conditions.
Prolonged periods of inﬂationary pressure on some or all input costs will result in increased costs to produce our
products that may result in reduced gross profit or necessitate price increases for our products that could adversely affect
consumer demand for our products.
In addition, since the majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets, our products
must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances. Shortages in ocean or air freight capacity and volatile
fuel costs can result in rapidly changing transportation costs. Similarly, disruption to shipping and transportation channels
due to labor disputes could cause us to rely more heavily on alternative modes of transportation to achieve timely delivery
to our customers, resulting in significantly higher freight costs. Because we price our products in advance and changes in
transportation and other costs may be difficult to predict, we may not be able to pass all or any portion of these higher costs
on to our customers or adjust our pricing structure in a timely manner in order to remain competitive, either of which could
have a material adverse eﬁect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
