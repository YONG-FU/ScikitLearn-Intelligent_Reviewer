Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Based on that
evaluation, our chief executive ofﬁcer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported in a timely manner and (2) accumulated
and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial ofﬁcer, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Design and Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Report of Management
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).
