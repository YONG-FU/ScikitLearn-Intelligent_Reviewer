Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive
Ofﬁcer (our Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (our Principal Accounting and Financial Ofﬁcer) of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as deﬁned in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). Based on this
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports ﬁled or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act is (i) recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods speciﬁed in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
disclosure.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent
or detect all errors and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, operated and managed, can provide only reasonable
assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, no
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
