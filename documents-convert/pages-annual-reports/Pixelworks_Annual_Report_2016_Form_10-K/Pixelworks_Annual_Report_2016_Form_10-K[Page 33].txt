201 6 v. 2015
Net revenue decreased $6.1 million, or 10%, from 2015 to 2016. Revenue related to integrated circuit ("IC") product sales was $53 .4 million and $59.5
million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. We did not record revenue related to licensing of intellectual property ("IP") for 2016 and revenue related to
licensing of IP was negligible for 2015.
The $6.1 million decrease in IC product sales from 2015 to 2016, was primarily attributable to decreased unit sales into the digital projector market, which in
turn was due to customers' efforts to adjust inventory levels. A decrease in overall average selling price ("ASP") in 2016 compared to 2015 also contributed to
the overall decrease in revenue. The decrease in ASP was primarily due to increased unit sales into the mobile device market in 2016 compared to 2015.
As a result of implementing an end-of-life for our legacy products, primarily products sold into the TV & panel market, we expect revenue in excess of our
normalized quarterly revenue during the ﬁrst half of 2017. Taking into account seasonal order patterns, we expect this excess to equal approximately $9.0
million for the ﬁrst quarter of 2017 and to equal approximately $5.0 million for the second quarter of 20 1 7. In the second half of 2017, we expect revenue
associated with sales into the TV & panel market to decline to zero following this fulﬁllment of end-of-life orders. Sales into the TV & panel market have
been declining over the past several years and have ranged from $1.1 million to $1.5 million, per quarter, over the past four quarters.
2015 v. 2 01 4
Net revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 2%, from 2014 to 2015. Revenue related to IC product sales was $59.5 million and $57.7 million for 2015 and 2014,
respectively. Revenue related to licensing of IP was negligible for 2015 and was $3 .2 million for 2014.
The $1.8 million increase in IC product sales from 2014 to 2015, was primarily attributable to increased unit sales into the digital projector and mobile
device markets partially offset by decreased unit sales into the TV and panel market, which generally have a lower ASP than digital projector market
products. The decrease in sales into the TV and panel market was due to a transition to lower volume niche products.
The $3.2 million of licensing revenue recorded in 2014 was due to achieving milestones under licensing agreements entered into during 2012 and 2013.
