As of December 31, 2016, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $226.0 million and $11.5 million, respectively, which
will expire between 2017 and 2036. As of December 31, 2016, we have available federal and state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $8.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, which begin expiring in 2019. We have a general foreign tax credit of $2.9 million which will
begin expiring in 2017. Our ability to utilize our federal net operating losses may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, which imposes an annual limit on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an "ownership change" to use its net operating loss carryforwards to
reduce its tax liability. An ownership change is generally deﬁned as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by 5% shareholders in any three-year
period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents
Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.0 million from $26.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $19.6 million at December 31, 2016. The net decrease
resulted primarily from $3.0 million used to pay the outstanding balance on our line of credit, $2.1 million used for purchases of property and equipment and
$1.4 million used for payments on other asset ﬁnancings. The decrease was also due to $1.5 million used in operating activities primarily due to our net loss
recorded in 2016, partially offset by changes in working capital. These decreases were partially offset by $1.1 million in proceeds from the issuances of
common stock under our employee equity incentive plans.
Total cash and cash equivalents increased $8.7 million from $17.9 million at December 31, 2014 to $26.6 million at December 31, 2015 . The increase
resulted primarily from $16.4 million in net proceeds from our underwritten registered public offering of our common stock (see "Equity offering"), as well as
$1.0 million in proceeds from the issuances of common stock under our employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $3 .8 million used in operating
activities primarily due to changes in working capital, $3.1 million used for purchases of property and equipment and licensed technology and $1.8 million
used forpayments on other asset ﬁnancings.
As of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents balance of $19.6 million consisted of $ 1 .6 million in cash and $18.0 million in US. denominated
money market ﬁlnds. Although we did not hold short- or long-term investments as of December 31, 2016, our investment policy requires that our portfolio
maintains a weighted average maturity of less than 12 months. Additionally, no maturities can extend beyond 24 months and concentrations with individual
securities are limited. At the time of purchase, short-term credit rating must be rated at least A-l / P-l / F—1 by at least two Nationally Recognized Statistical
Rating Organizations ("NRSRO") and securities of issuers with a long-term credit rating must be rated at least A or A2 by at least two NRSROS. Our
investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our Audit Committee.
As of December 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $ 1 9.6 million, of which approximately $1.6 million was held by our foreign
subsidiaries. We provide for US. taxes on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and will only recognize U.S. taxable income from repatriation to the extent
of our unremitted earnings. Any income recognized from the repatriation will be offset by our net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2016, we
could access all cash held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring signiﬁcant cash taxes.
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable, net decreased to $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 from $6.0 million at December 31, 2015 . Average number of days sales outstanding
decreased to 18 days at December 31, 2016 from 40 days at December 31, 2015 . The decrease in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding was
primarily due to normal ﬂuctuations in the timing of sales and customer receipts within the fourth quarter of 2016, and the fourth quarter of 2015.
Inxentories,
Inventories decreased to $2.8 million at December 31, 2016 from $3.3 million at December 31, 2015 . Inventory turnover increased to 10.1 at December 31,
2016 from 7.8 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower average inventory balances and increased cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of 2016
compared to the fourth quarter of 20 1 5. Inventory turnover is calculated based on annualized quarterly operating results and average inventory balances
during the quarter.
