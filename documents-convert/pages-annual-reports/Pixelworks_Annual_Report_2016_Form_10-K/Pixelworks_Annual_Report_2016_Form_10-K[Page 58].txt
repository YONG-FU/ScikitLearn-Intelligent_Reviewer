Deferred Tax Assets, Liabilities and Valuation Allowance
Deferred income taxes reﬂect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes
and the amounts for income tax purposes. Signiﬁcant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Net operating loss carryforwards $ 77,357 $ 73,903

With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 in the fourth quarter of 2015, we were required to classify all deferred tax assets and
liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, as non-current on the balance sheet. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the
beginning of our fourth quarter of 2015 and prior periods in the consolidated balance sheets were not retrospectively adjusted. Therefore, we have not
classiﬁed any portion of our net deferred tax asset balance as current as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The non-current portion of the net deferred tax asset
balance was $1 13 and $135 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets.
ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. Due to the ﬁll valuation allowance on the US. net deferred tax assets, we do not expect the
adoption of this update to impact our ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows.
We continue to record a ﬁll valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 as it is not more likely than not
that we will realize a beneﬁt from these assets in a future period. We have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our foreign net deferred tax
assets as we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize a beneﬁt from these assets in a ﬁJture period because our subsidiaries in these
jurisdictions are cost-plus taxpayers. The net valuation allowance increased $1,555, increased $1,732 and increased $3,656 for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
