Employee Equity Incentive Plans
On May 23, 2006, our shareholders approved the adoption of the Pixelworks, Inc. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). The 2006 Plan has since been
amended on certain occasions, most recently on May 11, 2016 when our shareholders approved an increase to the total number of authorized shares to
10,683,333 shares. The 2006 Plan replaced our previously existing stock incentive plans including our 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2001
Nonqualiﬁed Stock Option Plan, the Equator Technologies, Inc. 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and Equator Technologies, Inc. stand-alone option
plans (collectively, "Old Stock Incentive Plans"). Upon adoption of the 2006 Plan, no additional options could be issued under the Old Stock Incentive Plans
and as of December 31, 2016, there were no longer any outstanding awards previously granted under the Old Stock Incentive Plans. As of December 31, 2016,
1,055,704 shares were available for grant under the 2006 Plan.
Stock Options
Options granted must generally be exercised while the individual is an employee. In May 2009, the 2006 Plan was modiﬁed to reduce the contractual life of
newly issued stock awards from ten to six years. Our new hire vesting schedule provides that each option becomes exercisable at a rate of 25% on the ﬁrst
anniversary date of the grant and 2.083% on the last day of every month thereafter for a total of 36 additional increments. Our merit vesting schedule
provides that merit-type awards become exercisable monthly over a period of three years.
