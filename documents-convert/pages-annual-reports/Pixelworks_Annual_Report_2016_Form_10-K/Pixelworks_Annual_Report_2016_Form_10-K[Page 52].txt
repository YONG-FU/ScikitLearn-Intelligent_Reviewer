In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires a dual approach
for lessee accounting under which a lessee would account for leases as ﬁnance leases or operating leases. Both ﬁnance leases and operating leases will result
in the lessee recognizing a right-of—use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability. For ﬁnance leases the lessee would recognize interest expense and
amortization of the ROU asset and for operating leases the lessee would recognize a straight-line total lease expense. ASU 2016-02 will become effective for
the Company on January 1, 2019. While we are currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our ﬁnancial statements, we expect the primary
impact to our ﬁnancial position upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under noncancelable operating
leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under
noncancelable operating leases are disclosed in "Note 7: Commitments and Contingencies".
In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015—1 1, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ("ASU 2015-1 1"), which changes the
measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-1 1 deﬁnes net realizable value
as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. ASU 2015-11 is
effective prospectively and is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this update to
materially impact our ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASU 2014-09"), which requires that an
entity recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in US. GAAP when it becomes
effective. ASU 2014-09 allows for either full retrospective or modiﬁed retrospective adoption and will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.
We have developed an implementation plan to adopt this new guidance. As part of this plan, we are currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on
our results of operations. Based on our procedures performed to date, nothing has come to our attention that would indicate that the adoption of ASU 2014-
09 will have a material impact on our ﬁnancial statements, however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment in 2017. We intend to adopt ASU 2014-09
on January 1, 2018. We have not yet selected a transition method, but expect to do so in 2017 upon completion of ﬁirther analysis.
