Restructuring
In April 2016, we executed a restructuring plan to streamline the Company’s operations and product offerings and to align the Company’s expenses with
current revenue levels. The plan included an approximately 24% reduction in workforce, primarily in the area of development, however, it also impacted
operations, sales and marketing. The plan also included abandonment of certain assets resulting in impairment charges to write off the assets associated with
markets we are no longer pursuing.
Restructuring expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was as follows (in thousands):

During 2016, we incurred expenses of $4.4 million related to the restructuring plan, which primarily consisted of costs associated with employee severance
and beneﬁts of $2.6 million and the abandonment of certain assets of $ 1 .7 million. Through December 31, 2016, the cumulative amount incurred related to
the restructuring plan is $4.4 million, of which $1.8 million is included in cost of revenue. We expect to incur negligible additional restructuring charges in
2017.

recorded tax contingencies due to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31,
2015 is comprised of $0.6 million in current and deferred tax expense for our proﬁtable cost-plus foreign jurisdictions and accruals for tax contingencies in

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we continue to record a ﬁll valuation allowance against our US. net deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not
that we will realize a beneﬁt from these assets in a future period. We have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our other foreign net deferred tax
assets as we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize a beneﬁt from these assets in a ﬁiture period because our subsidiaries in these
jurisdictions are cost-plus taxpayers.
