The anti-takeover provisions of Oregon law and in our articles of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock,
including by preventing a sale or takeover of us at a price or prices favorable to the holders of our common stock.
Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Oregon law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of
us, making a merger or acquisition of us less desirable to a potential acquirer or preventing a change in our management, even if our shareholders consider the
merger, acquisition or change in management favorable or if doing so would beneﬁt our shareholders. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that
investors would be Willing to pay in the ﬁiture for shares of our common stock. The following are examples of such provisions:
0 if the number of directors is ﬁxed by the board at eight or more, our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered terms, which
would make it more difficult for a group of shareholders to quickly replace a majority of directors;
0 our board of directors is authorized, without prior shareholder approval, to create and issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences
that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us or to effect a change of control, commonly referred to as "blank check" preferred stock;
0 members of our board of directors can be removed only for cause and at a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, by the vote of
75 percent of the votes then entitled to be cast for the election of directors;
0 our board of directors may alter our bylaws without obtaining shareholder approval; and shareholders are required to provide advance notice for
nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at a shareholder meeting;
0 Oregon law permits our board to consider other factors beyond stockholder value in evaluating any acquisition offer (so-called "expanded
constituency" provisions); and
0 a supermaj ority (67%) vote of shareholders is required to approve certain fundamental transactions.
