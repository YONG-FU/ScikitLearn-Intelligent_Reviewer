Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The fair value of stock-based compensation was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
Year Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Stock Option Plans: ‘
Risk free interest rate 1.37% 1.52% 1.64%
1 Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0%{
Expected term (in years) 5.00 5.00 5.00
] Volatility 74% 68% 73%
Emp1_oyee Stock Purchase Plan:
I Risk free interest rate 0.20% 0.28% 0.22%‘
Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0%
I Expected term (in years) 1.12 1.10 1.02 ‘
Volatility 84% 89% 82%
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.41, $2.93 and $3 .50, respectively. The
risk free interest rate is estimated using an average of treasury bill interest rates. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have not paid any dividends to
date and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the
expected term as this represents our best estimate of future volatility. Subsequent to the May 2009 amendment of our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, which
shortened the contractual life of newly issued stock options from ten to six years, we have elected to use the "simpliﬁed method" to estimate expected term.
Under the simpliﬁed method, an option's expected term is calculated as the average of its vesting period and original contractual life. The expected term of
ESPP purchase rights is based on the estimated weighted average time to purchase.
As of December 31, 2016, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense is $3,049, which is expected to be recognized as stock-based compensation
expense over a weighted average period of 2.80 years.
