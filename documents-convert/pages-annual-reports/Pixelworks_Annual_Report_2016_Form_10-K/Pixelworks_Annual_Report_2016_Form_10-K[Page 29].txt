As of February 28, 2017, there were 70 shareholders of record of our common stock and the last per share sales price of the common stock on that date was
$3 .96. The number of beneﬁcial owners of our common stock is substantially greater than the number of shareholders of record because a signiﬁcant portion
of our outstanding common stock is held in broker "street name" for the beneﬁt of individual investors.
To date, we have not declared any cash dividends and we currently expect to retain any earnings to ﬁnance the expansion and development of our business.
In addition, our ﬁnancial covenants may limit our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will declare or pay future dividends as
they are dependent upon ﬁiture earnings, capital requirements, our operating and ﬁnancial condition and approval by our board of directors.
