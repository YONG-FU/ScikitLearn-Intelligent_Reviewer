Contract Manufacturers
In the normal course of business, we commit to purchase products from our contract manufacturers to be delivered within the next 90 days. In certain
situations, should we cancel an order, we could be required to pay cancellation fees. Such obligations could impact our immediate results of operations but
would not materially affect our business.
Indemniﬁcations
Certain of our agreements include limited indemniﬁcation provisions for claims from third-parties relating to our intellectual property. It is not possible for us
to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments or indemniﬁcation costs under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of our
obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. We have not made any payments under these agreements in the
past, and as of December 31, 2016, we have not incurred any material liabilities arising from these indemniﬁcation obligations. In the future, however, such
obligations could immediately impact our results of operations but are not expected to materially affect our business.
Legal Proceedings
We are subject to legal matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although we currently believe that resolving such matters,
individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial position, our results of operations, or our cash ﬂows, these matters are
subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future.
NOTE 8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average shares
outstanding include the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period.
The following schedule reconciles the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):
Year Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
'Net loss $ (11,107) $ (10,570) $ (9,960) l
Weighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 28,276 25,088 22,766
'Net loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.3 9) $ (0.42) $ (0.44) l
The following weighted average shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect would have been anti—dilutive (in
thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Employee equity incentive plans 4,982 4,248 4,346 ‘
Potentially dilutive common shares from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of
outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase
plan.
