exercisable at the time of such termination; all restricted stock units granted by the Company to the Executive prior to the Change of Control shall accelerate
and become vested as to the number of shares that would have otherwise vested during the twelve (12) months following such termination as if the Executive
had remained employed by the Company (or its successor) to the extent such restricted stock options are outstanding at the time of such termination; and all
stock subject to a right of repurchase by the Company (or its successor) that was purchased prior to the Change of Control shall have such right of repurchase
lapse with respect to that number of shares which would have had such right of repurchase lapse under the applicable agreement within twelve (12) months of
the date of the termination as if the Executive had remained employed through such date, pLOLidﬁﬁ, however, that the twelve (12) month period shall be pro-
rated to reﬂect that number of months remaining in the Second Year as of the date of termination. For purposes of this subsection (3), only entire months that
remain in the Second Year shall be counted as “remaining,” and any fraction of a month that remains after the date of the termination shall not be counted
hereunder.
(b) Termination Apartﬁom anChangeioL Control. If the Executive’s employment with the Company terminates other than as a result
of an Involuntary Termination within the twenty-four (24) months following a Change of Control, then the following provisions shall apply:
(i) Involuntaryierminaﬁtion. If the termination is an Involuntary Termination, the Executive shall be entitled to the same
beneﬁts described in Section 4(a)(i), calculated as if the date of the Change of Control were immediately following the effective date of the Involuntary
Termination, except that for this purpose Section 4(a)(i)(2) shall be revised to read as follows:
“(2) All stock options granted by the Company to the Executive prior to the Change of Control shall accelerate and become vested and
exercisable as to the number of shares that would have otherwise vested during the twelve (12) months following such termination as if the
Executive had remained employed by the Company (or its successor) through such date under the applicable option agreements to the
extent such stock options are outstanding and unexercisable at the time of such termination; and all stock subject to a right of repurchase
by the Company (or its successor) that was purchased prior to the Change of Control shall have such right of repurchase lapse with respect
to that number of shares which would have had such right of repurchase lapse under the applicable agreement within twelve (12) months of
the date of the termination as if the Executive had remained employed through such date.”
(ii) For Cause or Voluntary Termination. Ifthe termination is for Cause or is not otherwise an Involuntary Termination,
then the Executive will not be entitled to receive severance or other beneﬁts hereunder.
(iii) For avoidance of doubt, receipt of the beneﬁts for an Involuntary Termination under Section 4(b)(i) shall not preclude
the Executive’s receipt of any additional beneﬁt which is provided under Section 4(b)(v) if such Involuntary Termination occurs at any time within six (6)
months before a Change of Control.
(c) Accrued Wages and Vacation; Expenses. Without regard to the reason for, or the timing of, Executive’s termination of
employment: (i) the Company shall pay the Executive any unpaid base salary due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (ii) the Company shall pay the
Executive all of the Executive’s accrued and unused vacation through the Termination Date; and (iii) following submission of proper expense reports by the
Executive, the Company shall reimburse the Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the Executive in connection with the business
of the Company prior to the Termination Date. These payments shall be made promptly upon termination and within the period of time mandated by law.
5. Limitationonllayments. In the event that the severance and other beneﬁts provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to the
Executive (i) constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the United States Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and (ii) would
be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the “Excise Tax”), then Executive’s beneﬁts under this Agreement shall be either
(a) delivered in ﬁlll, or
(b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such beneﬁts being subject to the Excise Tax,
whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by
Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of beneﬁts, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such beneﬁts may be taxable under Section
4999 ofthe Code.
