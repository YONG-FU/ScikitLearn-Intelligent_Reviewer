The provisions of this Section 10 shall only apply if, and to the extent, required to avoid the imputation of any tax, penalty or interest pursuant to Section
409A. Any amounts otherwise payable to Executive upon or in the six (6) month period following the Executive’s separation from service that are not so paid
by reason of this Section 10 shall be paid (without interest) as soon as practicable (and in all events within thirty (30) days) after the date that is six (6)

payment due to the Executive pursuant to any such provision shall be paid to the Executive on or before the last day of the Executive’s taxable year
following the taxable year in which the related expense was incurred. The beneﬁts and reimbursements pursuant to Section 4 are not subject to liquidation or
exchange for another beneﬁt and the amount of such beneﬁts and reimbursements that the Executive receives in one taxable year shall not affect the amount

mean a “separation from service” under Section 409A.
