201 6 v. 2015
Research and development expense decreased $5.6 million from 2015 to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.7 million decrease in compensation
expense primarily as a result of the restructuring plan that was executed in April 2016. The decrease was also due to the timing of development activities,
which decreased non—recurring engineering expense and depreciation and amortization expense by $2.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lastly, a $0.3
million decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the timing of awards granted and a $0.3 million decrease in facilities and information
technology allocations also contributed to the decrease in research and development expense during this period.
2015 v. 2 01 4
Research and development expense decreased $0.7 million from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in stock-based
compensation expense primarily due to the timing of awards granted, and a $0.5 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the timing
of development activities. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in facilities and information technology allocations. The decreases
were also offset by a $0.1 million increase due to a beneﬁt to research and development recognized in 2014 for a reduction in direct labor costs and allocated
overhead associated with the utilization of research and development engineers on license revenue agreements; these costs were recorded in cost of revenue.
There was no similar beneﬁt to research and development in 2015.

201 6 v. 2015
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.7 million from 2015 to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in stock-
based compensation expense due to the timing of awards granted as well as a general decrease across most other expense categories as we focused on cost
management. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 also included largely offsetting expenses for severance and a reversal of stock-based
compensation expense associated with the February 1, 2016 resignation of our former Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, Bruce Walicek.
2015 v. 2 01 4
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $1.0 million from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in stock-
based compensation expense primarily due to the timing of awards granted, and a $0.2 million decrease in compensation expense primarily due to a decrease
in headcount.
