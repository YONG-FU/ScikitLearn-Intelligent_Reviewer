NOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is deﬁned as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. Three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:
Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2: Valuations based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.
Level 3: Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop
its own assumptions.
The following table presents information about our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2016 and 2015:
Level 1 _ Level 2 _ Level 3 _ Total
lAs ofDecember31,2016: ‘
Money market funds $ 17,960 $ — $ — $ 17,960
lAs ofDecember31,2015: 1
Money market funds $ 25,343 $ — $ — $ 25,343
We primarily use the market approach to determine the fair value of our ﬁnancial assets. The fair value of our current assets and liabilities, including accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximates the carrying value due to the short-term nature of these balances. We have currently chosen not to elect the
fair value option for any items that are not already required to be measured at fair value in accordance with US. GAAP.
NOTE 5: RESTRUCTURING
In April 2016, we executed a restructuring plan to streamline the Company’s operations and product offerings and to align the Company’s expenses with
current revenue levels. The plan included an approximately 24% reduction in workforce, primarily in the area of development, however, it also impacted
operations, sales and marketing. The plan also included abandonment of certain assets resulting in impairment charges to write off the assets associated with
markets we are no longer pursuing.
Total restructuring expense included in our statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 is comprised of the following:
