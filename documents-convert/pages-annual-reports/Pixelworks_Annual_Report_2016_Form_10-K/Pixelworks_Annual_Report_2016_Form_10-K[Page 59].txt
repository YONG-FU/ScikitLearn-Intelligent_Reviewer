As of December 31, 2016, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $225,989 and $11,490 respectively, which will expire between 2017
and 2036. As of December 31, 2016, we had available federal and state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of $8,555 and $3,821,
respectively, which will begin expiring in 2019. We have a general foreign tax credit of $2,895 which will begin expiring in 2017. Our ability to utilize our
federal net operating losses may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which imposes an annual limit on the ability
of a corporation that undergoes an "ownership change" to use its net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its tax liability. An ownership change is generally
deﬁned as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by 5% shareholders in any three-year period.
We had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $2,856 as of December 31, 2016, for which we have recorded a deferred tax liability.
Our Chinese subsidiary is designated as an Advanced Technology Service Enterprise, allowing it to beneﬁt from a Chinese tax holiday resulting in a
reduction of its tax rate to 15% through 2018.
On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 was enacted, which permanently extended the research and development tax
credit retroactively, beginning on January 1, 2015 .
Uncertain Tax Positions
We have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving positions that could be challenged by taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2016
the amount of our uncertain tax positions was a liability of$ 1,419 and a reduction to deferred tax assets of $560. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of our
uncertain tax positions was a liability of$1,519 and a reduction to deferred tax assets of $473.
The following is a summary of the change in our liability for uncertain tax positions and interest and penalties:
2016 _ 2015
'Uncertain tax positions: 1
Balance at beginning of year $ 1,863 $ 1,646
l Accrual for positions taken in a prior year (126) 135 ‘
Accrual for positions taken in current year 257 299
l Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations (108) _ (217) 1
Balance at end ofyear $ 1,886 $ 1,863
’Interest and penalties: 7 7 7 1
Balance at beginning of year $ 129 $ 226
l Accrual for positions taken in prior year 7 9 ‘
Accrual for positions taken in current year 19 —
l Reversals due to lapse of statute of limitations (62) _ (106) 1
Balance at end of year $ 93 $ 129
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $26, $9 and $17, respectively, of interest and penalties in income tax expense in
our consolidated statements of operations.
We ﬁle income tax returns in the US. and various foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is resolved by
settlement or statute of limitations. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash. If the uncertain tax positions we have accrued for are
sustained by the taxing authorities in our favor, the reduction of the liability will reduce our effective tax rate. We reasonably expect reductions in the
liability for unrecognized tax beneﬁts and interest and penalties of approximately $191 within the next twelve months due to the expiration of statutes of
limitation in foreign jurisdictions.
We are no longer subject to US. federal, state, and foreign examinations for years before 2013, 2012 and 2009, respectively. Our net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards from all years may be subject to adjustment for three years following the year in which utilized. We do not anticipate that any potential
tax adjustments will have a signiﬁcant impact on our ﬁnancial position or results of operations.
We were not subject to, nor have we received any notice of, income tax examinations in any jurisdiction as of December 31, 2016.
