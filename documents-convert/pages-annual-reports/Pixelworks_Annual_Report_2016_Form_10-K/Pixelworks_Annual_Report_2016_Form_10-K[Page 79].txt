The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide the Executive with an incentive to continue
Executive’s employment following, and so to maximize the value of the Company upon, a Change of Control for the beneﬁt of its shareholders and to
provide the Executive with severance upon an involuntary termination. To do so, the Board believes it appropriate to provide the Executive with certain
severance beneﬁts upon the Executive’s termination of employment following a Change of Control or in the case of an involuntary termination.
