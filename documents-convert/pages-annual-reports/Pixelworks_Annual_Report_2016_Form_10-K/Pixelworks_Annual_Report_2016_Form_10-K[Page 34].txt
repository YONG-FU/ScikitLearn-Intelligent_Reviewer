201 6 v. 2015
Cost of revenue increased to 53% of revenue in 2016 from 51% of revenue in 2015 . The increase was primarily due to restructuring charges of $ 1 .8 million
recorded during 2016, primarily for the abandonment of tooling, inventory and licensed technology associated with markets we are no longer pursuing.
Our gross margin is subject to variability based on changes in revenue levels, recognition of licensing revenue and licensing costs, product mix, ASPs, startup
costs, restructuring charges and the timing and execution of manufacturing ramps, as well as other factors.
2015 v. 2 01 4
Cost of revenue increased to 51% of revenue in 2015 from 48% of revenue in 2014, primarily due to a decrease in the recognition of higher margin licensing
revenue during 2015 compared to 2014.
