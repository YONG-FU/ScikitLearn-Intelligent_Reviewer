NOTE 7. COMlVIITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Royalties
We license technology from third parties and have agreed to pay certain suppliers a royalty based on the number of chips sold or manufactured, the net sales
price of the chips containing the licensed technology or a ﬁxed non-cancelable fee. Royalty expense is recognized based on our estimated average unit cost
for royalty contracts with non—cancelable prepayments and the stated contractual per unit rate for all other agreements. Royalty expense was $722, $826 and
$977 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which is included in cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
401(k) Plan
We sponsor a 401 (k) plan for eligible employees. Participants may defer a percentage of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis, not to exceed the
dollar limit that is set by law. A discretionary matching contribution by the Company is allowed and is equal to a uniform percentage of the amount of salary
reduction elected to be deferred, which percentage will be determined each year by the Company. We made no contributions to the 40 1 (k) plan during the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Leases
We acquire rights to use certain software engineer design tools under software licenses, accounting for such arrangements is similar to capital leases.
Our various ofﬁce space and equipment leases are classiﬁed as operating leases. Certain of our leases for ofﬁce space contain provisions under which monthly
rent escalates over time and certain leases also contain provisions for reimbursement of a speciﬁed amount of leasehold improvements. When lease
agreements contain escalating rent clauses, we recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. When lease agreements provide
allowances for leasehold improvements, we capitalize the leasehold improvement assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease
term or the estimated useﬁll life of the asset, and reduce rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the amount of the asset capitalized.
When lease agreements provide rent holidays, we reduce rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the amount of the rent holiday.
As of December 31, 2016, future minimum payments under non-cancelable software licenses and operating lease agreements are as follows:
