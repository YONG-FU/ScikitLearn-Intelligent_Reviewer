OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose
entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes.
We have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain
customers. For more information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see Note 8 “Balance Sheet Details” to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
