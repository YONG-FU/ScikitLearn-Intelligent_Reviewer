Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
lower mix of commercial PCs within Personal Systems. The unit volume decline was primarily due to a unit volume decline in
desktops, partially offset by a unit volume growth in notebooks, both consumer and commercial.
Net revenue for commercial clients decreased 8% primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, a decline in commercial
desktops as a result of weak market demand and higher net revenue in the prior-year period resulting from the replacement of
the Windows XP operating system. Net revenue for consumer clients decreased 8% primarily due to unfavorable currency
impacts and a decline in consumer desktops. Net revenue declined 17% in Desktop PCs, 2% in Notebook PCs, 9% in
Workstations and 10% in Other. The net revenue decline in Other was primarily due to a decline in consumer tablets, the sale of
intellectual property assets in the prior—year period, and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially oﬁset
by increased sales of extended warranties.
Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.5 percentage points for fiscal
year 2015 as a result of a decline in gross margin combined with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and a lower mix of commercial
products, partially offset by favorable component costs and operational cost improvements. Operating expenses as a percentage
of net revenue increased primarily due to the size of the net revenue decline, higher administrative expenses as a result of lower
bad debt recoveries as compared to the prior-year period and higher R&D investments in commercial, mobility and immersive
computing products, the effects of which were partially offset by a decline in ﬁeld selling costs as a result of favorable currency
impacts and operational cost improvements.
