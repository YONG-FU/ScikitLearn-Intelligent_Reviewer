HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 7: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)
In connection with the Separation, HP entered into the TMA with Hewlett Packard Enterprise effective on November 1,
2015 that governs the rights and obligations of HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain pre Separation tax liabilities. The
TMA provides that HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share certain pre Separation income tax liabilities. In certain
jurisdictions, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have joint and several liability for past income tax liabilities and accordingly,
HP could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.
In addition, if the distribution of Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s common shares to HP stockholders is determined to be
taxable, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP would share the tax liability equally, unless the taxability of the distribution is the
direct result of action taken by either Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP subsequent to the distribution in which case the party
causing the distribution to be taxable would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.
Upon completion of the Separation on November 1, 2015, HP recorded net income tax indemnification receivables from
Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain income tax liabilities that HP is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is
indemnified by Hewlett Packard Enterprise under the TMA. The actual amount that Hewlett Packard Enterprise may be
obligated to pay HP could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for
several years. The net receivable as of October 31, 2016 was $1.6 billion. In connection with the TMA, Interest and other, net
for fiscal year 2016 includes $472 million of changes in the tax indemniﬁcations amounts.

HP has third-party arrangements, consisting of revolving short-term financing, which provide liquidity to certain partners
in order to facilitate their working capital requirements. These financing arrangements, which in certain circumstances may
contain partial recourse, result in a transfer of HP’s receivables and risk, to the third-party. As these transfers qualify as true
sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon
transfer, and HP receives a payment for the receivables from the third-party within a mutually agreed upon time period. For
arrangements involving an element of recourse, the recourse obligation is measured using market data from the similar
transactions and reported as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recourse obligations as of October 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 were not material. As of October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, HP had $149 million, $93 million and $271
million, respectively, outstanding from the third parties, which is reported in Accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The costs associated with the sales of trade receivables for fiscal year 2016 were not material.
The following is a summary of the activity under these arrangements:
