(1) Investments in publicly-traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported
on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded.
(2) The fair value for corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities is based on observable inputs of comparable
market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on active exchanges, fair value is based on
observable quoted prices. Also included in this category is debt issued by national, state and local governments and
agencies.
(3) Alternative Investments primarily include private equities and hedge funds. The valuation of alternative investments,
such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. For alternative
investments, valuation is based on NAV as reported by the Asset Manager and adjusted for cash ﬂows, if necessary. In
making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including but not limited to the timeliness
of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last
NAV reported by the asset manager. Depending on the amount of management judgment, the lack of near-term liquidity,
and the absence of quoted market prices, these assets are classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Further, depending on how quickly HP can redeem its hedge fund investments, and the extent of any adjustments to
NAV, hedge funds are classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
- Private equities include limited partnerships such as equity, buyout, venture capital, real estate and other similar funds
that invest in the United States and internationally where foreign currencies are hedged.
- Hedge funds include limited partnerships that invest both long and short primarily in common stocks and credit,
relative value, event driven equity, distressed debt and macro strategies. Management of the hedge funds has the
ability to shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to large capitalization stocks and bonds, and
from a net long position to a net short position.
