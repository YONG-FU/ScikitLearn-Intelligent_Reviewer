Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a
majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be
impacted, by ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance
excluding the impact of foreign currency ﬂuctuations, we supplementally present the year-over—year percentage change in net
revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior—year period
and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is
provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without the effect of ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is
provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over—year percentage change in net revenue on a GAAP basis. Other
companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for
comparative purposes.
Results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:

Net Revenue
In fiscal year 2016, total net revenue from continuing operations decreased 6.3% (decreased 2% on a constant currency
basis) as compared with fiscal year 2015. Net revenue from the United States increased 1.7% to $18.0 billion, while net revenue
from outside of the United States decreased 10.4% to $30.2 billion. The primary factors contributing to the net revenue decline
were unfavorable currency impacts, weak market demand, competitive pricing pressures and the change in the Supplies sales
model. The net revenue decline was driven by decline in supplies, commercial and consumer printers, commercial and
consumer desktops and consumer notebooks, partially oﬂset by growth in commercial notebooks.
In fiscal year 2015, total net revenue from continuing operations decreased 9.2% (decreased 4.7% on a constant currency
basis) as compared with fiscal year 2014. Net revenue from the United States decreased 2.6% to $17.7 billion, while net
revenue from outside of the United States decreased 12.2% to $33.7 billion. The primary factors contributing to the net revenue
decline were unfavorable currency impacts, particularly in EMEA, weak market demand and competitive pricing pressures. The
net revenue decline was driven by desktops and supplies, partially offset by growth in notebooks and graphics products.
A more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “Segment
Information” below.
