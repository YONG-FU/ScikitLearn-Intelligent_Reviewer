(1) Net EPS for each quarter is computed using the weighted—average number of shares outstanding during that quarter,
while EPS for the fiscal year is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year.
Hence, the sum of the EPS for each of the four quarters may not equal the EPS for the fiscal year.

None.
ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive oﬁicer and
principal financial oﬁicer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d—15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period
covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive oﬁicer and principal financial
officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information
relating to HP, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (1) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated
to HP’s management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.
