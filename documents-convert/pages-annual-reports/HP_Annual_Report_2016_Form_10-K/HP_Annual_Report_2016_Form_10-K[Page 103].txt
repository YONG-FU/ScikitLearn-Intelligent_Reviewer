Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 11: Financial Instruments (Continued)
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign
currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. HP uses total return swaps to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan
liability.
For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative
instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings in the period of change.
Hedge Effectiveness
For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge eﬁectiveness by offsetting the change in fair
value of the hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts
designated as cash ﬂow hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the
hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP
recognizes any ineﬁective portion of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same period in which
ineffectiveness occurs. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Earnings in the period they arise.

October 31, 2016 and 2015, information related to the potential effect of HP’s master netting agreements and collateral security
agreements was as follows:
