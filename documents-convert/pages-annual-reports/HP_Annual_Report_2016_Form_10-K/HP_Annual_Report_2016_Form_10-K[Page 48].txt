(1) Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair
value adjustments, discounts or premiums.
(2) Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. We have outstanding
interest rate swap agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest
rates associated with some of our US. Dollar Global Notes to variable interest rates. The impact of our outstanding
interest rate swaps at October 31, 2016 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt.
(3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and
that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable
price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These purchase obligations are related principally to
inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase
obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of
business as they are difﬁcult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered
enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on
our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.
(4) Amounts represent the operating lease obligations, net of total sublease income of $218 million.
(5) Amounts represent the capital lease obligations, including total capital lease interest obligations of $35 million.
(6) Retirement and Post-Retirement Beneﬁt Plan Contributions. In fiscal year 2017, we anticipate making contributions of
$26 million to non-US. pension plans, approximately $33 million to cover benefit payments to US. non-qualified
pension plan participants and approximately $9 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. Our
policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by
local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-
retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual
cash outﬂows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more
information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 5, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit
Plans”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(7) Cost Savings Plans. We expect to make future cash payments of between $3 84 million and $534 million in connection
with our cost savings plans through fiscal year 2019. These payments have been excluded from the contractual
obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outﬂows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of
these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 4, “Restructuring and Other Charges”, to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.
(8) Uncertain Tax Positions. As of October 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.9 billion of recorded liabilities and related
interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash
settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these
obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions,
