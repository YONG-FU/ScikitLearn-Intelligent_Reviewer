Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
There were no unregistered sales of equity securities in fiscal year 2016. We did not repurchase any shares of our

open market transactions.
On July 21, 2011, HP’s Board of Directors authorized a $10.0 billion share repurchase program. HP may choose to
repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value.
This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private
transactions. On October 10, 2016, the Board authorized an additional $3.0 billion for future repurchases of its outstanding
shares of common stock. HP intends to use repurchases from time to time to oﬂset the dilution created by shares issued under
employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. As of October 31, 2016, HP had approximately $3.8 billion
remaining under repurchase authorization.
