HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Interest and other, net expense decreased by $600 million in fiscal year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to changes
in indemnification receivables from Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain tax liabilities that HP is jointly and severally liable
for, but for which it is indemniﬁed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise under the tax matters agreement and lower foreign currency
losses, partially offset by lower interest income.
Interest and other, net expense decreased by $5 million in fiscal year 2015. The decrease was due to lower other
miscellaneous expense.
Provision for Taxes
Our effective tax rates were 29.1%, (5.3)% and 24.3% in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our effective tax
rate generally differs from the US. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from
our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most
significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were Puerto Rico, Singapore, China, Malaysia and Ireland.
We plan to reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the United States and therefore has not provided
U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings. In addition to the above factors, the overall tax rates in fiscal year 2016
were impacted by adjustments to valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions.
For a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the US. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our
provision for taxes, see Note 7, “Taxes on Earnings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference.
In fiscal 2016, we recorded $301 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year for continuing
operations. These amounts primarily include uncertain tax position charges of $525 million related to pre-separation tax
matters. In addition, we recorded $62 million of net tax benefits on restructuring and other charges, $52 million of net tax
benefits related to the release of foreign valuation allowances and $41 million of net tax benefits arising from the retroactive
research and development credit provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 20 16 signed into law in December 2015
and $70 million of other tax benefit.
In fiscal year 2015, we recorded $1.2 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts
included $1.7 billion of tax benefits due to a release of valuation allowances pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets, $449
million of tax charges related to uncertain tax positions on pension transfers, $70 million of tax benefits related to state tax
impacts, and $6 million of income tax charges related to various other items. In addition, we recorded $33 million of income
tax charges on restructuring and pension-related costs.
In fiscal year 2014, we recorded $69 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts
included $37 million of income tax benefits related to provision to return adjustments, $25 million of income tax charges
related to state rate changes, $41 million of income tax benefits for adjustments related to uncertain tax positions, and $16
million of income tax benefits related to other items.
