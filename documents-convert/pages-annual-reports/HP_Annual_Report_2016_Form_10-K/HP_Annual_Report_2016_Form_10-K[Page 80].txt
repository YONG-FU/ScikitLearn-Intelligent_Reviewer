(I) Investments in publicly-traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported
on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded.
(2) The fair value for corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities is based on observable inputs of comparable
market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on active exchanges, fair value is based on
observable quoted prices. Also included in this category is debt issued by national, state and local governments and
agencies.
(3) Alternative Investments primarily include private equities and hedge funds. The valuation of alternative investments,
such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. For alternative
investments, valuation is based on net asset value (“NAV”) as reported by the Asset Manager and adjusted for cash

limited to the timeliness of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market
