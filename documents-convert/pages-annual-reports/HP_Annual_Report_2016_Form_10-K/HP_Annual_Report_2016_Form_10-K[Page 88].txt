The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have
received had all option holders exercised their options on the last trading day of fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. The
aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HP’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the
exercise price, multiplied by the number of in—the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years
2016, 2015 and 2014 was $26 million, $214 million and $151 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options
vested in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $11 million, $131 million and $82 million, respectively.
