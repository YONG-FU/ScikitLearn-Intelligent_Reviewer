Restricted S tack Awards
HP uses the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of service-based restricted stock units. HP
estimates the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using a combination of the
closing stock price on the grant date and the Monte Carlo simulation model. The weighted-average fair value and the
assumptions used to measure fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions in the Monte
Carlo simulation model were as follows:

(I) The weighted-average fair value was based on performance-adjusted restricted stock units granted during the period.
(2) The expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatility derived from HP ’3 common stock.
(3) The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on US. Treasury zero-coupon issues.
(4) The expected performance period was estimated based on the length of the remaining performance period from the grant
date.
