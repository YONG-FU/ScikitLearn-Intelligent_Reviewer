Note 3: Segment Information
HP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and
related technologies, solutions and services. HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBS”)
and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.
HP’s operations are organized into three segments for financial reporting purposes: Personal Systems, Printing and
Corporate Investments. HP’s organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the chief operating decision maker
uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of
products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by HP’s chief
operating decision maker to evaluate segment results. The chief operating decision maker uses several metrics to evaluate the
performance of the overall business, including earnings from operations, and uses these results to allocate resources to each of
the segments.
