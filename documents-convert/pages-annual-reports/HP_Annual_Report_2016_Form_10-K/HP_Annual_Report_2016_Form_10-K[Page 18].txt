- local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs;
- managing a geographically dispersed workforce;
- changes or uncertainty in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;
- differing technology standards or customer requirements;
- import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct
investments, which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping
products to particular countries or markets, aﬁect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase
our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;
° stringent privacy and data protection policies in some foreign countries;
- diﬁiculties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in
tax laws; and
- ﬂuctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the
transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and
shipments.
The factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located
outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and
other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.
In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business
practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended
(the “FCPA”). Although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our
employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations,
may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse
effect on our business and reputation.
Any failure by us to identiﬁz, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully
could harm our financial results, business and prospects.
As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic
alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, “business combination and investment
transactions”). Risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which
could adversely aﬁect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial results:
- Managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources,
which may divert our attention from other business operations.
° We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment
transaction, and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment
transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third-parties or market
trends.
- Certain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by Hewlett-Packard Company
resulted, and in the future any such transactions by us may result, in significant costs and expenses, including
those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment
charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, asset impairment charges, inventory
adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required
payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
- Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make
business combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.
° Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our
ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of
statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third-parties or their representatives.
- The pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to
make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due
diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other
matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated.
- In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially
creating dilution for our existing stockholders.
