As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and
services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2027. The
gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $341 million ($0.20 diluted net
EPS) in fiscal year 2016, $322 million ($0.18 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2015 and $596 million ($0.31 diluted net EPS) in
fiscal year 2014. The gross income tax benefits were offset partially by accruals of US. income taxes on undistributed earnings,
among other factors.
