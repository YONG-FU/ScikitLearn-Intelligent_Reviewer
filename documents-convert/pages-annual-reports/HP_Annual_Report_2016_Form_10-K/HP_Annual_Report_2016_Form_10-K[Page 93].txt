In 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-17, “Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes”, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. This guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and

retrospectively adjusted.
Current and long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:

advanced royalty payment arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $1.2 billion. During fiscal year 2015, HP executed
