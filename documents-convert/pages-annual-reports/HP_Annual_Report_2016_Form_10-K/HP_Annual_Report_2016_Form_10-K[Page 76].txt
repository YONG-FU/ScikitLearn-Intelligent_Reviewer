Lump sum program
During fiscal year 2016, HP oﬁered certain terminated vested participants of the Pension Plan the option of receiving
their pension benefit in a one-time voluntary lump sum during a specific window. Approximately 16,000 plan participants
elected to receive their beneﬁts and as a result the pension plan trust paid $977 million in lump sum payments to these
participants in fiscal year 2016. As a result of the lump sum program, HP recognized a settlement expense of approximately
$177 million in October 2016. The resulting re-measurement coincided with annual year end plan remeasurement and no
additional net periodic pension cost was incurred in fiscal year 2016.
In January 2015, HP offered certain terminated vested participants of the Pension Plan the option of receiving their
pension benefit in a one-time voluntary lump sum during a specified window. Approximately 50% of the eligible participants
elected to receive their beneﬁts and as a result the pension plan trust paid $826 million in lump sum payments to these
participants in fiscal year 2015. As a result of the lump sum program, HP recognized a settlement credit of approximately $79
million in fiscal year 2015. As a result of the settlement, additional net periodic benefit cost of $20 million was recorded in
