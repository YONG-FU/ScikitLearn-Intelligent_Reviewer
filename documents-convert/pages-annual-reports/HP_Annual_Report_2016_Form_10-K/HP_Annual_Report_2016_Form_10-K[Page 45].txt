Our historical statements of cash ﬂows represent the combined cash ﬂows and key cash ﬂow metrics of HP prior to the
Separation and have not been revised to reﬂect the eﬁect of the Separation. For further information on discontinued operations,
see Note 2, “Discontinued Operations” in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8,

Our key cash ﬂow metrics were as follows:

In millions
’Net cash provided by operating activities 55 3,230 EB 6,490 $ 12,333 ‘

’Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (14,423) 1,344 (6,571):
Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (11,145) $ 2,300 $ 2970
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.3 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015,
since the net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2015 included the impact of discontinued operations, which is
not included in the net cash provided by operating activities for ﬁscal year 2016, as a result of the Separation.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared to
fiscal year 2014. The decrease was due primarily to lower cash generated from working capital management activities,
payments for Separation costs, lower cash receipts from contract manufacturers and financing receivables, lower net earnings in
the current period, unfavorable currency impacts, as well as higher cash payments for prepaid expenses and employee benefits.
