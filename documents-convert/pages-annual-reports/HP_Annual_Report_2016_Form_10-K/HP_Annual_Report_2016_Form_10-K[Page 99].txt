Note 10: Fair Value
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
Fair Value Hierarchy
HP uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed
using market data such as publicly available information and reﬂect the assumptions market participants would use, while
unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use.
Assets and liabilities are classiﬁed in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement:
Level l—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-
corroborated inputs.
Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The following table presents HP’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
