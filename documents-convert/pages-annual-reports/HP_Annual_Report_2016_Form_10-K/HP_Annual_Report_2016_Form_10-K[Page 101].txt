All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash
equivalents. As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short
period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $24 million
in fiscal year 2016, $75 million in ﬁscal year 2015, and $72 million in fiscal year 2014. Time deposits were primarily issued by
institutions outside the United States as of October 31, 2016 and 2015. The estimated fair value of the available-for—sale
investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.
There was no gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2016 and 2015.
Contractual maturities of investments in available-for—sale debt securities were as follows:

Derivative Instruments
HP uses derivatives to oﬂset business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash ﬂows
and on certain existing assets and liabilities. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily
forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency,
interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges or cash ﬂow
