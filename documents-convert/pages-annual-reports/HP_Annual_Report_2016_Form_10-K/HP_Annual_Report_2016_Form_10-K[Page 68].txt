Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 1: Overview and Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies (Continued)
HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP
records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 15, “Litigation and Contingencies” for a full description of HP’s loss contingencies
and related accounting policies.
Note 2: Discontinued Operations
On November 1, 2015, HP completed the Separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. After the Separation, HP does not
beneficially own any shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock.
In connection with the Separation, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution
agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties, including
among others a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a transition service agreement, a real estate matters
agreement, a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement. These agreements provide for
the allocation between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise of assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including
investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the
Separation and govern certain relationships between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise after the Separation.
After the Separation, HP no longer consolidates the financial results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise within its financial
results of continuing operations. For all the periods prior to the Separation, the financial results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
are presented as net earnings from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and assets and liabilities
of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The following table presents the financial results of HP’s discontinued operations:
