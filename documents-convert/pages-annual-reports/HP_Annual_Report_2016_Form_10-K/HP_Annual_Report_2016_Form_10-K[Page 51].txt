We have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, using a modeling
technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of
interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments and
interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps. The
discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in eÔ¨Åect at October 31, 2016 and 2015. The sensitivity analyses for
continuing operations indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the
fair values of our debt and investments, net of interest rate swaps, of $51 million at October 31, 2016 and $67 million at
October 31, 2015.
