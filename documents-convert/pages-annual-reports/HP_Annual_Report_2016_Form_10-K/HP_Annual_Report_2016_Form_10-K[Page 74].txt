Fiscal 2 01 7 Plan
On October 10, 2016, HP’s Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2017 Plan”) which it expects
will be implemented through fiscal year 2019. HP estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges between $350 million
and $500 million relating to workforce reductions, real estate consolidation and other non-labor charges. HP estimates that
approximately half of the expected cumulative pre-tax costs will relate to severance and the remaining will relate to
infrastructure and other. HP expects between 3,000 and 4,000 employees to exit by the end of fiscal year 2019.
Fiscal 2015 Plan
In connection with the Separation, on September 14, 2015, HP’s Board of Directors approved a cost savings plan (the
“Fiscal 2015 Plan”) which includes labor and non-labor actions. The Fiscal 2015 Plan was considered complete as of October
31, 2016 and we do not expect any further costs associated with this plan. Approximately 3,000 employees exited by the end of
fiscal year 2016.
During fiscal year 2016, HP announced a voluntary PRP for certain qualified employees. Qualified employees will retire
gradually over a defined period of time and at the end of which they will receive severance and certain benefits. HP recognized
charges aggregating $29 million during fiscal year 2016 related to the PRP.
