HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)
Gross Margin
Our gross margin from continuing operations decreased to 18.7% for fiscal year 2016 compared with 19.3% for fiscal
year 2015. The decline in gross margin performance was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by
operational improvements.
Our gross margin from continuing operations decreased to 19.3% for fiscal year 2015 compared with 19.8% for ﬁscal
year 2014. The primary factors impacting gross margin performance were competitive pricing environment and unfavorable
currency impacts, partially offset by favorable component costs in Personal Systems, favorable mix of ink and graphics supplies
and operational cost improvements.
A more detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under
“Segment Information” below.
Operating Expenses
Research and Development (“R&D ”)
R&D expense increased 2% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to incremental investments
in A3 and 3D printing, partially offset by favorable currency impacts.
R&D expense decreased 8% in fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency
impacts.
Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A ”)
SG&A expense decreased 19% in ﬁscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to gains from the
divestiture of certain software assets to Open Text Corporation, lower corporate governance and other overhead costs related to
the pre-Separation combined entity, our cost saving initiatives and favorable currency impacts. These effects were partially
offset by the gain from the divestiture of Snapfish in the prior-year period.
SG&A expense decreased 12% in ﬁscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to favorable currency
impacts and declines in go-to-market costs as a result of lower commissions and productivity initiatives.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization expense decreased by $86 million and $27 million in fiscal year 2016 and in fiscal year 2015 respectively,
primarily due to prior acquisitions reaching the end of their respective amortization periods.
Restructuring and other Charges
Restructuring and other charges increased by $142 million in fiscal year 2016 primarily due to severance pay and
infrastructure related charges from our restructuring plan initially announced in September 2015 (the “Fiscal 2015 Plan”).
On October 10, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2017 Plan”) which will be
implemented through fiscal year 2019. HP recognized $24 million of charges related to the Fiscal 2017 Plan during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2016.
Restructuring and other charges decreased by $113 million in ﬁscal year 2015 primarily due to lower charges from our
restructuring plan initially announced in May 2012 (the “Fiscal 2012 Plan”). HP recognized $39 million of charges related to
the Fiscal 2015 Plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015.
