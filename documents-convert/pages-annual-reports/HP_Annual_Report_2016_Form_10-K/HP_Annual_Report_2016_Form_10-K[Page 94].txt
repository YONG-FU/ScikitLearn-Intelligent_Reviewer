intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangements resulting in advanced payments of $3.8 billion, while during fiscal year
2014, HP executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement and an intercompany advanced royalty payment
arrangement which resulted in combined advanced payments of $3.8 billion, the result of which was the recognition of zero net
U.S. deferred tax assets in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 and $0.6 billion in fiscal year 2014. In these transactions, the payments
were received in the United States from a foreign consolidated affiliate, with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term
of the arrangements, which is approximately 18 months for fiscal year 2016, 5 years for fiscal year 2015 and 15 years for fiscal
year 2014. Intercompany royalty revenue is eliminated in consolidation.
Separation costs are expenses associated with HP’s plan to separate into two companies. HP recorded a deferred tax asset
on these costs and expenses as they were incurred through fiscal year 2015. HP expected a portion of these deferred tax assets
associated with separation costs and expenses to be non-deductible expenses, at the time the Separation was executed.
Furthermore, HP has also concluded on the legal form of the Separation and in May 2015 announced that Hewlett Packard
Enterprise was the spinnee in the United States. In order to reﬂect the impact of separation activities, HP recorded adjustments
to certain deferred and prepaid tax assets as well as income tax liabilities reﬂecting the impact of separation related activities.
As of October 31, 2016, HP had $627 million, $2.0 billion and $25.3 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal
year 2018 and amounts included in federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2030. HP also has capital
loss carryforwards of approximately $197 million which will expire in 2021. HP has provided a valuation allowance of $87
million and $8.2 billion for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, that
HP does not expect to realize.
