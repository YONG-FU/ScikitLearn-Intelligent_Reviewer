(4) The Common Contractual Fund is an investment arrangement in which institutional investors pool their assets. Units
may be acquired in six different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments and emerging
markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund’s investment objective and units are issued in relation to
each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a
month, depending on the sub-fund. These assets are valued at NAV and classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
(5) Department of Labor 103-12 IE (Investment Entity) designation is for plan assets held by two or more unrelated
employee benefit plans which includes limited partnerships and venture capital partnerships. Common collective trusts,
interests in 103-12 entities and registered investment companies are valued at NAV. The valuation for some of these
assets requires judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, and these assets are generally classified in Level 2
of the fair value hierarchy.
(6) Includes publicly and privately traded Registered Investment Entities.
(7) Includes cash and cash equivalents such as short-term marketable securities. Cash and cash equivalents include money
market funds, which are valued based on NAV. Other assets were classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the
lowest level input (e. g., quoted prices and observable inputs) that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety.
(8) Includes primarily unsettled transactions, international insured contracts, and derivative instruments. Such unsettled
transactions relate primarily to fixed income securities settled in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
