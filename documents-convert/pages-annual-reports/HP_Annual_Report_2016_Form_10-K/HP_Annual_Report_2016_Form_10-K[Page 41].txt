Fiscal Year 2 01 6 compared with Fiscal Year 2015
Personal systems net revenue decreased 4.9% (decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal year 2016. The net
revenue decline in Personal Systems was primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts and weak market demand. Personal
Systems net revenue decreased as a result of a 3.5% decline in unit volume along with a 1% decline in average selling price
(“ASP”) as compared to the prior—year period. The unit volume decline was primarily due to an overall decline in desktops and
consumer notebooks, partially offset by unit volume growth in commercial notebooks. The decline in ASP was primarily due to
competitive pricing in the commercial segment partially oﬁset by favorable pricing in the consumer segment and favorable mix

Consumer and commercial revenue both decreased by 5%, primarily due to weak market demand, partially offset by an
increase in commercial notebooks and PC services. Net revenue declined 2% in Notebooks, 9% in Desktops, 7% in
Workstations and 9% in Other as compared to the prior-year period. The net revenue decline in Other was primarily due to
lower sales in consumer tablets and Personal Systems options partially oﬁset by revenue growth in PC services.
Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal
year 2016. The increase was primarily due to growth in gross margin driven by favorable commodity costs combined with
product mix and increase in PC services, the effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in revenue.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage point primarily driven by an increase in field
selling cost.
Fiscal Year 2015 compared with Fiscal Year 2014
