We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash ﬂow expectations,
cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and
targeted capital structure.
Short-term debt decreased by $2.1 billion and long-term debt increased by $0.1 billion for fiscal year 2016 as compared to
fiscal year 2015. The net decrease in total debt was primarily due to redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed rate US. Dollar Global
Notes in November 2015.
Short-term debt decreased by $0.4 billion and long-term debt decreased by $8.9 billion for fiscal year 2015 as compared
to fiscal year 2014. The net decrease in total debt was primarily due to the redemption of $6.6 billion of US. Dollar Global
Notes in connection with the Separation and maturities of $2.5 billion of US. Dollar Global Notes in fiscal year 2015. During
the month of November 2015, we paid $2.1 billion for the redemption of US. Dollar Global Notes as part of the final
settlement of the debt redeemed as a part of the Separation.
Our debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ equity. Our debt-to-
equity ratio decreased by 2.08x in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to negative equity resulting from the transfer of net assets of
$32.5 billion to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and redemption of $2.1 billion of fixed-rate US. Dollar Global Notes due to the
Separation. During fiscal year 2016, we generated operating cash ﬂow of $3.2 billion. Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by
0.35x in fiscal year 2015, due to a decrease in total debt balances of $9.3 billion coupled with an increase in total stockholders’
equity by $1.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015.
Our weighted-average interest rate reﬂects the eﬁective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and
reﬂects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 11, “Financial Instruments”
in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
As of October 31, 2016, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending
commitments of $4.0 billion, which will be available until April 2, 2019 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial
paper. Funds borrowed under this revolving credit facility may also be used for general corporate purposes.
Available Borrowing Resources
As of October 31, 2016, we had available borrowing resources of $822 million from uncommitted lines of credit in
addition to our $4.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility discussed above. For more information on our
borrowings, see Note 12, “Borrowings”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated
herein by reference.
Credit Ratings
Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as
information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. While we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would
accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our
credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral
under some of our derivative contracts. In addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may
further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have a negative impact on
our liquidity and capital position. We can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facilities,
if necessary, to oﬁset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.
