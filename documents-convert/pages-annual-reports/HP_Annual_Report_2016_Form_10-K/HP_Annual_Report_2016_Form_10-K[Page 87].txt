HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Note 6: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)
In fiscal year 2015, HP assumed approximately 8 million shares of restricted stock units through acquisition with a
weighted-average grant date fair value of $33 per share.
The total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $54 million, $889
million and $338 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2016, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense
related to non-vested restricted stock awards for continuing operations was $180 million, which is expected to be recognized
over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years.
Stock Options
HP utilizes the Black-Scholes—Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-
based vesting conditions. HP estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions
using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these awards contain market conditions. The
weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:
For the ﬁscal years ended

{Weighted-average fair value“) $ 4 $ 8 $ 7 1

Expected dividend yield“) 3.5% 1.8% 2.1%
I Expected term in years(5) 6.0 5.9 5.7 l
(I) The weighted-average fair value was based on stock options granted during the period.
(2) For all awards granted in fiscal year 2016, expected volatility was estimated using the leverage-adjusted average of the
term-matching volatilities of peer companies due to the lack of volume of forward traded options, which precluded the use
of implied volatility. For all awards granted in fiscal year 2015, expected volatility was estimated using the implied
volatility derived from options traded on HP’s common stock. For awards granted in fiscal year 2014, expected volatility
for awards subject to service-based vesting was estimated using the implied volatility derived from options traded on HP’s
common stock, whereas for performance-contingent awards, expected volatility was estimated using the historical
volatility of HP’s common stock.
(3) The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on US. Treasury zero-coupon issues.
(4) The expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected term of the
award.
(5) For awards subject to service-based vesting, due to the lack of historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns of
the post—Separation employee base, the expected term was estimated using a simplified method for all awards granted in
fiscal year 2016 and the expected term was estimated using historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns for all
awards granted in fiscal years 2015 and 2014; and for performance-contingent awards, the expected term represents an
output from the lattice model.
