2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES — (continued)
Foreign Currency Translations— The Company accounts for currency translations in accordance
with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. The Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries’ local currencies are
the functional currencies under which the balance sheet accounts are translated into US. dollars at
the rates of exchange in effect at fiscal year-end and income and expense accounts are translated at
the weighted average rates of exchange in effect during the year. Translation adjustments resulting
from this process are recognized as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss, which is a component of equity.
Foreign Currency Transactions — Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
included in other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Net foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) totaled $513,000 of gains in 2016, as compared to losses of
($961,000) and ($268,000) in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The foreign currency transaction gains recognized in 2016 resulted mainly from unrealized gains
on foreign exchange contracts entered into by Florsheim Australia. The foreign currency transaction
losses recognized in 2015 resulted mainly from unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts
entered into by Florsheim Australia, as well as losses from the revaluation of intercompany loans
between the Company’s wholesale segment and Florsheim Australia. The foreign currency
transaction losses recognized in 2014 resulted mainly from the revaluation of intercompany loans
between the Company’s wholesale segment and Florsheim Australia
