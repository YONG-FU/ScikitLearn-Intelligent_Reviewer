The Company also has licensing agreements with third parties who sell its branded apparel,
accessories and specialty footwear in the United States, as well as its footwear in Mexico and certain
markets overseas. Licensing revenues are included in the Company’s wholesale segment. The
Company’s retail segment consisted of 13 Company-owned retail stores and an internet business in
the United States as of December 31, 2016. Sales in retail outlets are made directly to consumers by
Company employees. The Company’s “other” operations include the Company’s wholesale and retail
businesses in Australia, South Africa and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”) and Europe
(“Florsheim Europe”). The majority of the Company’s operations are in the United States, and its
