REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Weyco Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive
income, equity, and cash flows of Weyco Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) for the year
ended December 31, 2014. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial
statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Weyco Group, Inc. and subsidiaries for
the year ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
