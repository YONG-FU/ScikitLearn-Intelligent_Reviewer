The Company’s wholesale business faced a challenging retail environment in 2016. Foot traffic
at the Company’s customers’ brick and mortar stores has been declining, as the popularity of online
shopping continues to grow. Nunn Bush was particularly impacted because a significant amount of
the brand’s business is with mid-tier department stores, a segment particularly struggling with this
problem. Sales of the BOGS brand also declined, mainly due to the continued impact of the mild
2015/2016 winter season, as retailers carried over BOGS inventory into the 2016/2017 winter
season.
Licensing revenues consist of royalties earned on sales of branded apparel, accessories and
specialty footwear in the United States and on branded footwear in Mexico and certain overseas
markets. The decrease in licensing revenues resulted mainly from licensee transitions that occurred
in 2016.
Earnings from Operations
Gross earnings as a percent of net sales were 32.1% in 2016 versus 32.5% in 2015 this year.
Earnings from operations in the North American wholesale segment were $16.4 million in 2016, down
32% as compared to $24.3 million in 2015. This year’s wholesale operating earnings included an
impairment charge of $1.8 million related to the Umi trademark. Last year’s wholesale operating
earnings included $458,000 of income representing the final adjustment to the BOGS/Rafters earnout
payment. Without these non-recurring adjustments, wholesale earnings from operations would have
been down 24% for the year, due mainly to the decrease in wholesale sales.
The Company’s cost of sales does not include distribution costs (e.g., receiving, inspection or
warehousing costs) or shipping and handling expenses. The Company’s distribution costs were
$11.7 million and $11.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
Company’s wholesale shipping and handling expenses were $1.6 million and $1.9 million in the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs were included in selling and
administrative expenses. The Company’s gross earnings may not be comparable to other companies,
as some companies may include distribution costs in cost of sales.
North American wholesale segment selling and administrative expenses include, and are
primarily related to, distribution costs, salaries and commissions, advertising costs, employee benefit
costs and depreciation. Wholesale selling and administrative expenses decreased $627,000 in 2016,
as compared to the prior year. Excluding the non-recurring adjustments described above, wholesale
selling and administrative expenses would have been down $2.8 million between years, primarily due
to lower employee benefit costs and advertising costs. As a percent of net sales, wholesale selling
and administrative expenses were 25% and 23% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Without the
