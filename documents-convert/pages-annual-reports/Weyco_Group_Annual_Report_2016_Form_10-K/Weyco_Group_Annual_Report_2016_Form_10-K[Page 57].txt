In 2015, the FASB issued guidance which simplified the presentation of deferred income taxes
by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified
statement of financial position. The Company adopted this guidance for the year ended
December 31, 2016 on a prospective basis. Prior period balances were not adjusted.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income
Taxes (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be
recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only if the position is more likely than
not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.
The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits:
2016 2015 2014

The unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015, include $70,000 and $108,000,
respectively, of interest related to such positions. The unrecognized tax benefits, if ultimately
recognized, would reduce the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The liabilities for potential interest
are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
The Company files a U.S. federal income tax return, various U.S. state income tax returns and
several foreign returns. In general, the 2014 through 2016 tax years remain subject to examination
by those taxing authorities.
