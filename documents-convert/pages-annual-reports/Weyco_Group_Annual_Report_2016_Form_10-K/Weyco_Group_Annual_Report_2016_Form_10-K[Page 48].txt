The Company performs impairment tests for goodwill and trademarks on an annual basis and
more frequently if an event or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not
be recoverable. Conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment include, but are not limited
to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the
asset
The Company’s goodwill resulted from the 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. The
Company uses a two-step process to test this goodwill for impairment. The first step is to compare
the applicable reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. The Company determined that the
applicable reporting unit is its wholesale segment. If the fair value of the wholesale segment is
greater than its carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value is greater than the fair
value, then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. The
second step calculates the implied fair value of the goodwill, which is compared to its carrying value.
If the implied fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the
difference. In 2016, the testing determined that the estimated fair value of the wholesale segment
exceeded its carrying value, therefore there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company has never
recorded an impairment charge on this goodwill.
The Company tests its trademarks for impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each
trademark to its related carrying value. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow
methodology. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated the current state of the Umi
business and determined the brand did not fit the long-term strategic objectives of the Company. As a
result, the Company recorded a $1,770,000 impairment charge to write off the majority of the value of
