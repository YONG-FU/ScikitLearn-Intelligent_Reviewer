2016 vs. 2015
Non-Recurring Adjustments
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated the current state of its Umi business and
determined the brand did not fit the long-term strategic objectives of the Company. As a result, the
Company recorded a $1.8 million impairment charge ($1.1 million after tax) to write off the majority of
the value of the Umi trademark. The Company is currently reviewing a number of alternatives for the
future of the Umi brand.
Additionally, in the fourth quarter 2016, the Company reviewed its liquidity needs and sources of
capital, including evaluating whether it would need the cash available under corporate-owned life
insurance policies on two former executives. It was determined that the chances were remote that
the Company would need to surrender these policies to satisfy liquidity needs, and, as a result, the
Company reversed the $3.1 million deferred tax liability related to these policies.
Finally, in 2015, the Company recorded a $458,000 adjustment ($279,000 after tax) to the final
earnout payment related to the 2011 acquisition of the BOGS/Rafters brands. The final earnout
payment was paid in March 2016.
