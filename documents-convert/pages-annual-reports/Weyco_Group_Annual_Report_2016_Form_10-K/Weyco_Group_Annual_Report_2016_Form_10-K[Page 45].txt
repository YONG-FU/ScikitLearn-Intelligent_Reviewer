Recent Accounting Pronouncements —
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-04 “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying
the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ” This new standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill
impairments by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The amendments in this update
are effective for annual impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for goodwill impairment tests performed on or after January 1, 2017. The
Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Compensation — Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” This new standard
simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross
stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain
reclassifications on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this update are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842).” This new standard
requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and
obligations created by finance and operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The
amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and
interim periods therein. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this
standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the
Measurement of Inventory. ” The new standard clarifies that, for inventories measured at the lower of
cost and net realizable value, net realizable value should be determined based on the estimated
selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this new accounting
standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” outlines a new, single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with
customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry specific
guidance. The new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and
how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective
Date.” The amendment in this update defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 for all entities by
