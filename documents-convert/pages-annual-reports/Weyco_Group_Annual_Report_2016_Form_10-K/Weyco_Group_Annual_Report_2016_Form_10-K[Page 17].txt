EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Sales and Earnings Highlights
Consolidated net sales were $296.9 million in 2016, a decrease of 7% as compared to
$320.6 million in 2015. Earnings from operations were $21.2 million this year, down 29% as
compared to $29.8 million in 2015. Net earnings attributable to Weyco Group, Inc. decreased 10% to
$16.5 million in 2016, from $18.2 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.56 in 2016, as
compared to $1.68 in 2015.
Earnings for 2016 included an impairment of long-lived assets charge of $1.8 million ($1.1 million
after tax) related to the Umi trademark, offset by a $3.1 million adjustment to reverse the deferred tax
liability on corporate-owned life insurance policies. Earnings for 2015 included $458,000 ($279,000
after tax) of income representing the final adjustment to the BOGS/Rafters earnout payment. Without
these non-recurring adjustments, earnings from operations and net earnings attributable to the
Company would have been down 22% and 20%, respectively, for the year.
Diluted earnings per share were $1.56 in 2016, as compared to $1.68 per share in 2015.
Without the non-recurring adjustments described above, diluted earnings per share on an adjusted
basis would have been $1.36 per share in 2016 and $1.65 in 2015.
Net sales in the Company’s wholesale segment decreased $23.8 million, or 9% for the year,
primarily due to lower sales of BOGS and Nunn Bush branded footwear. Net sales in the Company’s
retail segment decreased 1%, and net sales of the Company’s other businesses (Florsheim Australia
and Florsheim Europe) increased 1% for the year.
Consolidated earnings from operations decreased $8.5 million for the year. Excluding the
non-recurring adjustments related to the Umi trademark and the BCGS/Rafters final earnout
payment, consolidated earnings from operations would have been down $6.3 million for the year.
This decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the Company’s wholesale segment.
Earnings from operations in the Company’s retail segment were also down for the year, due to lower
sales at the Company’s brick and mortar locations. Earnings from operations of the Company’s other
businesses were down for the year, mainly due to lower operating earnings at the Company’s retail
store in Macau, resulting from lower sales.
