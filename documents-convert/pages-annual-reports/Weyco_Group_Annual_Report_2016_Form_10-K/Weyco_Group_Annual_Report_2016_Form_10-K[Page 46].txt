NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES — (continued)
one year. Additional ASUs have been issued as part of the overall new revenue guidance. This new
revenue standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.
The Company has begun its initial assessment of the new revenue standard, with a focus on
identifying the contracts with customers and assessing whether and what performance obligations
exist. Based on our preliminary assessment to date, the Company does not expect that the adoption
of this new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The
Company currently plans to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2018. The Company is
continuing its assessment, which may identify other impacts.
3. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (“ASC 820”) defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes the following three-level
hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the sources of data and assumptions used to
develop the fair value measurements:
Level 1 — unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
are publicly accessible.
Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs (other than
quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 — unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions, consistent with
reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
The carrying amounts of all short-term financial instruments, except marketable securities and
foreign exchange contracts, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments.
Marketable securities are carried at amortized cost. The fair value disclosures of marketable
securities are Level 2 valuations as defined by ASC 820, consisting of quoted prices for identical or
similar assets in markets that are not active. See Note 4. Foreign exchange contracts are carried at
fair value. The fair value measurements of foreign exchange contracts are based on observable
market transactions of spot and forward rates, and thus represent level 2 valuations as defined by
ASC 820. The Company’s contingent consideration was measured at fair value. See Note 10.
