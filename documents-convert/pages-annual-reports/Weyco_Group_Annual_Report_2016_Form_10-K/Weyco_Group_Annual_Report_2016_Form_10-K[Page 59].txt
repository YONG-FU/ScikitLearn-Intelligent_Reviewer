16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has two reportable segments: North American wholesale operations (“wholesale”)
and North American retail operations (“retail”). The chief operating decision maker, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on earnings
from operations. Therefore, interest income or expense, other income or expense, and income taxes
are not allocated to the segments. The “other” category in the table below includes the Company’s
wholesale and retail operations in Australia, South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe, which do not meet
the criteria for separate reportable segment classification.
In the wholesale segment, shoes are marketed through more than 10,000 footwear, department
and specialty stores, primarily in the United States and Canada. Licensing revenues are also
included in the Company’s wholesale segment. The Company has licensing agreements with third
parties who sell its branded apparel, accessories and specialty footwear in the United States, as well
as its footwear in Mexico and certain markets overseas. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there was no single
customer with sales above 10% of the Company’s total sales.
In the retail segment, the Company operated 13 Company-owned stores in principal cities and
an internet business in the United States as of December 31, 2016. Sales in retail outlets are made
directly to the consumer by Company employees. In addition to the sale of the Company’s brands of
footwear in these retail outlets, other branded footwear and accessories are also sold.
