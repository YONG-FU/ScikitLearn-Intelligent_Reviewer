non-recurring adjustments described above, wholesale selling and administrative expenses as
a percent of net sales would have been 24% and 23% in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
North American Retail Segment
Net Sales
Net sales in the Company’s North American retail segment were $21.9 million in 2016, down 1%
as compared to $22.1 million in 2015. Same store sales, which include U.S. internet sales, were up
1% for the year. There were three fewer domestic retail stores operating in 2016 than there were in
2015, as four stores closed and one store opened. Stores are included in same store sales beginning
in the store’s 13th month of operations after its grand opening. The increase in same store sales was
due to an increase in the Company’s U.S. internet business.
Earnings from Operations
Earnings from operations in the North American retail segment were $2.1 million in 2016, down
16% as compared to $2.5 million in 2015. Retail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were
65.0% in 2016 and 65.7% in 2015. Selling and administrative expenses for the retail segment
include, and are primarily related to, rent and occupancy costs, employee costs, advertising expense
and freight. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were 55% in 2016
compared to 54% in 2015. The decrease in retail earnings from operations was primarily due to lower
net sales at the Company’s brick and mortar locations.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). See Note 2 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. A $113,000 impairment charge
was recognized in 2016. No impairment charges were recognized in 2015.
Other
The Company’s other businesses include its wholesale and retail operations in Australia,
South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe. In 2016, net sales of the Company’s other businesses were
$47.5 million, up 1% as compared with $47.1 million in 2015. This increase was primarily due to
higher net sales in Florsheim Europe’s wholesale business. Earnings from operations at Florsheim
Australia and Florsheim Europe were $2.7 million in 2016, down 9% as compared to $3.0 million last
year. This decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings at the Company’s retail store in
Macau, resulting from lower sales.
