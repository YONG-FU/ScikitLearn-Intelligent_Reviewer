17. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
At December 31, 2016, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans: the 2011
Incentive Plan and the 2014 Incentive Plan (collectively, “the Plans”). Under the Plans, options to
purchase common stock were granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices not less than
the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The Company issues
new common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and the issuance of restricted stock awards.
Awards are no longer granted under the 2011 plan.
Stock options and restricted stock awards were granted on August 25, 2016, August 25, 2015,
and on August 26, 2014. Under the Plans, stock options and restricted stock awards are valued at
fair market value based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant. The stock options
and restricted stock awards granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014 vest ratably over four years. As of
December 31, 2016, there were 17,100 shares remaining available for stock-based awards under the
2014 Incentive Plan.
In accordance with ASC 718, stock-based compensation expense was recognized in the 2016,
2015 and 2014 consolidated financial statements for stock options and restricted stock awards
granted since 2010. An estimate of forfeitures, based on historical data, was included in the
calculation of stock-based compensation, and the estimate was adjusted quarterly to the extent that
actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to materially differ, from such estimates. The effect of
applying the expense recognition provisions of ASC 718 decreased Earnings Before Provision For
Income Taxes by $1,559,000 in each of the years 2016 and 2015, and $1,465,000 in 2014.
As of December 31, 2016, there was $1.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to non-vested stock options granted in the years 2013 through 2016 which is expected to be
recognized over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.7 years. As of December 31,
2016, there was $1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted
