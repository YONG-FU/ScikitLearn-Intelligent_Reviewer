LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are its cash and short-term marketable securities,
which aggregated $18.3 million at December 31, 2016, and $22.4 million at December 31, 2015, and
its revolving line of credit. In 2016, the Company generated $46.9 million of cash from operations,
compared with using $5.7 million of cash in operations in 2015, and generating $17.8 million of cash
from operations in 2014. Fluctuations in net cash from operating activities over the three-year period
have mainly resulted from changes in net earnings and operating assets and liabilities, and most
significantly the year-end inventory and accounts receivable balances. The increase in 2016 was
related to the reduction in inventory levels in accordance with customer orders, and also to reflect a
more conservative position based on the overall retail environment.
The Company’s capital expenditures were $6.0 million, $2.5 million and $2.9 million in 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company expects capital expenditures to be between $2 million
and $3 million in 2017. The increase in 2016 was due to improvements that were made to the
Company’s distribution center in Glendale, Wisconsin to increase its capacity, as well as remodeling
projects to improve two of the Company’s Florida retail stores, and the build out for the new store
opened in Florida this year.
The Company paid cash dividends of $8.9 million, $8.5 million and $8.2 million in 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively.
The Company continues to repurchase its common stock under its share repurchase program
when the Company believes market conditions are favorable. In 2016, the Company repurchased
410,983 shares for a total cost of $11.0 million. In 2015, the Company repurchased 354,741 shares
for a total cost of $9.9 million. In 2014, the Company repurchased 297,576 shares for a total cost of
$8.0 million. At December 31, 2016, the remaining total shares available to purchase under the
program was approximately 565,000 shares.
At December 31, 2016, the Company had a $60 million unsecured revolving line of credit with
a bank expiring November 3, 2017. The line of credit bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.75%. At
December 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings were approximately $4.3 million at an interest rate of
1.52%. The highest balance during the year was $28.4 million. At December 31, 2015, outstanding
borrowings were $26.6 million at an interest rate of 1.18%. The highest balance during 2015 was
$42.0 million.
In connection with the Bogs acquisition, the Company had two earn-out payments due to the
former shareholders of Bogs. The Company made the first earn-out payment of $1,270,000 in the
first quarter of 2013. The second and final earn-out payment of $5,217,000 was made in March 2016.

As of December 31, 2016, $3.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for operations in the U.S., the Company would be
required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. Management believes that under
the current tax law, the related tax impact of any such repatriation would not be material to the
Company’s financial statements. For additional information, see Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reviewed its liquidity needs and sources of capital,
including evaluating whether it would need the cash available under corporate-owned life insurance
policies on two former executives. It was determined that the chances were remote that the
Company would need to surrender the policies to satisfy liquidity needs, and, as a result, the
Company reversed the $3.1 million deferred tax liability related to the policies.
The Company will continue to evaluate the best uses for its available liquidity, including, among
other uses, capital expenditures, continued stock repurchases and additional acquisitions.
