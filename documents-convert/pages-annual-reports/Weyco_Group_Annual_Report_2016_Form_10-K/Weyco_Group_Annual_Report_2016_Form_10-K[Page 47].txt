At each reporting date, the Company reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in
fair value below the amortized cost basis is other-than-temporary. To determine whether a decline in
value is other-than-temporary, the Company considers all available evidence, including the issuer’s
financial condition, the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, and the Company’s intent
and ability to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for any forecasted
recovery. If a decline in value is deemed other-than-temporary, the Company records a reduction in
the carrying value to the estimated fair value. The Company determined that no other-than-temporary
impairment exists for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
