average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year. Weighted average cost of
capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures, market beta, risk-free rate of
return and estimated costs of borrowing. Changes in these key estimates and assumptions, or in
other assumptions used in this process, could materially affect the Company’s impairment analysis
for a given year.
Contingent Consideration
Contingent consideration was comprised of two earn-out payments that the Company was
obligated to pay the former shareholders of Bogs in connection with the Company’s acquisition of
Bogs in 2011. The contingent consideration was formula-driven and was based on Bogs achieving
certain levels of gross margin dollars between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015. The first
earn-out payment was paid on March 28, 2013 in the amount of $1,270,000. The second earn-out
payment was paid on March 23, 2016 in the amount of $5,217,000. The second and final earn-out
payment was recorded within accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2015.
Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company determined the fair value of the contingent
consideration using a probability-weighted model which included estimates related to Bogs future
sales levels and gross margins. On a quarterly basis, the Company revalued the obligation and
recorded increases or decreases in its fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings. Changes to
the contingent consideration obligation resulted from accretion of the discount due to the passage of
time and changes in the actual or projected future performance of Bogs. The assumptions used to
determine the fair value of the liability included a significant amount of judgment, and any changes in
the assumptions may have had a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense
or income recorded in a given period.
