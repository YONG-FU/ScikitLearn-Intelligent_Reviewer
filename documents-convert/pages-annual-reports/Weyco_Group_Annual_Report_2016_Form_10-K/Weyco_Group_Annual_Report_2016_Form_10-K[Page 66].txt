ITEM 9A CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the
information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. The Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d—15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report (the
“Evaluation Date”). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on such
evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in bringing to their attention on a timely basis information
relating to the Company required to be included in the Company’s periodic filings under the
Exchange Act.
