10. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Contingent consideration was comprised of two earn-out payments that the Company was
obligated to pay the former shareholders of The Combs Company (“Bogs”) in connection with the
Company’s acquisition of Bogs in 2011. The estimate of contingent consideration was formula-driven
and was based on Bogs achieving certain levels of gross margin dollars between January 1, 2011,
and December 31, 2015. The first earn-out payment was paid on March 28, 2013 in the amount of
$1,270,000. The second and final earn-out payment was paid on March 23, 2016 in the amount of
$5,217,000. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, the Company remeasured its
estimate of the fair value of the liability at each reporting date. The change in fair value was
recognized in earnings.
The following table summarizes the activity during 2016 and 2015 related to the second earn-out
payment as recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (dollars in thousands):

administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31,
2015.
The total contingent consideration was reflected in the Company’s wholesale segment. The fair
value measurement of the contingent consideration was based on significant inputs not observed in
the market and thus represented a level 3 valuation as defined by ASC 820.

as an unfunded supplemental pension plan for key executives. Retirement benefits are provided
