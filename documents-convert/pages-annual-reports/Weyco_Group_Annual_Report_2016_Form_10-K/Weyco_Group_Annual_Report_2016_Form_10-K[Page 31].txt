MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting. The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control = Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the
assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
The Company’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the
Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company’s
consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2016 as stated in its report below.
