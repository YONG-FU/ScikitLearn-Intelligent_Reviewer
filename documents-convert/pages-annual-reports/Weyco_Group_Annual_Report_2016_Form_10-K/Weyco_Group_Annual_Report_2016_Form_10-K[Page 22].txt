up 1% for the year. Stores are included in same store sales beginning in the store’s 13th month of
operations after its grand opening. The increase in same store sales was due to an increase in the
Company’s U.S. internet business.
Earnings from Operations
Earnings from operations in the North American retail segment were $2.5 million in 2015, down
24% as compared to $3.3 million in 2014. Retail gross earnings as a percent of net sales were
65.7% in 2015 and 65.9% in 2014. Selling and administrative expenses for the retail segment
include, and are primarily related to, rent and occupancy costs, employee costs and depreciation.
Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were 54% in 2015 compared to 52% in
2014. The decrease in retail earnings from operations was primarily due to lower net sales at the
Company’s brick and mortar locations.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, Property Plant and Equipment (“ASC 360”). See Note 2 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. No impairment charge was
recognized in 2015 or 2014.
Other
The Company’s other businesses include its wholesale and retail operations in Australia,
South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe. In 2015, net sales of the Company’s other businesses were
$47.1 million, down 12% as compared with $53.7 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to
lower net sales at Florsheim Australia, caused by the translation of the weaker Australian currency
into US. dollars. In local currency, Florsheim Australia’s net sales were up 7% for the year. Earnings
from operations at Florsheim Australia and Florsheim Europe were $3.0 million in 2015, down 38%
as compared to $4.8 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to lower operating earnings at
recently opened stores in Asia and Australia as well as lower operating earnings at the Company’s
retail store in Macau, as a result of higher operating expenses.
OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND TAXES
The majority of the Company’s interest income is from its investments in marketable securities.
Interest income was $763,000 in 2016, $936,000 in 2015, and $1.2 million in 2014. The decrease
over the three-year period was primarily due to lower average investment balances.
Interest expense was $436,000 in 2016, $181,000 in 2015 and $178,000 in 2014. The increase
in interest expense in 2016 was primarily due to interest recognized on a 2016 tax settlement.
Other income (expense), net, was $514,000 of income in 2016 compared to expense of
($1.4 million) and ($595,000) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. This year’s other income included
foreign currency transaction gains of $513,000, resulting mainly from unrealized gains on foreign
exchange contracts entered into by Florsheim Australia. Last year’s other expense included
($961,000) of foreign currency transaction losses, resulting mainly from unrealized losses on foreign
exchange contracts entered into by Florsheim Australia, as well as losses from the revaluation of
intercompany loans between the Company’s wholesale segment and Florsheim Australia. Additionally,
other expense for 2015 included $473,000 of expense related to the operating losses and write-off of
an investment by Florsheim Australia in a foreign joint venture. Other expense in 2014 included
($268,000) of foreign currency transaction losses, resulting mainly from the revaluation of
intercompany loans between the Company’s wholesale segment and Florsheim Australia.
The effective tax rate for 2016 was 23.0% compared with 37.7% in 2015 and 36.2% in 2014.
The decrease in 2016 was mainly due to the reversal of the deferred tax liability on corporate-owned
life insurance policies (14.2%), as discussed above. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to a
higher state tax liability as well as higher effective tax rates at the Company’s foreign locations.
