NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014
11. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS — (continued)
freeze was a reduction of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) to the amount of the plans’
accumulated benefit obligations. The decrease in the PBO reduced the unrecognized net actuarial loss
of the plan, which is reported on an after-tax basis in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. No curtailment gain was recognized in earnings. These plan changes will
reduce the service and interest cost of the plan for periods subsequent to the curtailment.
As noted above, the accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension plan and the
supplemental pension plan were equal to the respective plans’ projected benefit obligations as of
December 31, 2016, due to the pension plan curtailment. As of December 31, 2015, the accumulated
benefit obligations for the defined benefit pension plan and the supplemental pension plan were
$43.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively.
Assumptions used in determining net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 were:

Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the spot-rate approach to determine the
interest cost component of pension expense. Under the spot-rate approach, the interest cost is
calculated by applying interest to the discounted cash flow expected at each payment date. The
interest is determined using the same spot rate along the yield curve that was used to determine the
present value of the associated payment. Prior to 2016, the Company used a single
weighted-average rate in the determination of pension expense.
The Company considered the adoption of the spot rate approach a change in accounting
estimate and recognized the effects of the change on a prospective basis. The effects of adopting the
spot rate approach reduced net pension expense by approximately $522,000 in 2016, primarily due
to a reduction in interest cost.
The components of net pension expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014, were:

(1) The decrease in interest cost in 2016 was primarily due to the adoption of the spot-rate
approach, as described above.
