The Company follows ASC 715, Compensation = Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”) which
requires employers to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other
postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in their statements of financial position and to
recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of
comprehensive income. In addition, ASC 715 requires employers to measure the funded status of
their plans as of the date of their year-end statements of financial position. ASC 715 also requires
additional disclosures regarding amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The Company’s pension plan’s weighted average asset allocation at December 31, 2016 and

The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee, consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief
Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to manage the operations and administration of all
benefit plans and related trusts. The committee has an investment policy for the pension plan assets
that establishes target asset allocation ranges for the above listed asset classes as follows: equity
securities: 20% — 80%; fixed income securities: 20% — 80%; and other, principally cash: 0% — 20%.
On a semi-annual basis, the committee reviews progress towards achieving the pension plan’s
performance objectives.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company

as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 7.50%
long-term rate of return on assets assumption for 2016.
