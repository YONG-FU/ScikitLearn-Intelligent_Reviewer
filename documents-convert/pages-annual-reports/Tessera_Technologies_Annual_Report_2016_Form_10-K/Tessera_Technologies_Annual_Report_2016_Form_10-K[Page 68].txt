NOTE 10 — NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
The Company has a share-based compensation plan under which employees may be granted share-based awards including shares of restricted stock and restricted
stock units ("RSUs"). Non-forfeitable dividends are paid on unvested shares of restricted stock. No dividends are accrued or paid on unvested RSUs. As such,
shares of restricted stock are considered participating securities under the two-class method of calculating earnings per share. The two-class method of calculating
earnings per share did not have a material impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculation as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted shares (in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2015 2014 2013
Weighted average common shares outstanding 51,841 52,898 53,431
1 Unvested common shares subject to repurchase (39) _ (79) _ (85) 1
Total common shares-basic 51,802 52,819 53,346
1Effect of dilutive securities: 1
Stock awards 343 346 —
1 Restricted stock awards and units 441 _ 398 _ — 1
Total common shares-diluted 52,586 53,563 53,346
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding any unvested
restricted stock awards that are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed using the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted
average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares include unvested
restricted stock awards and units and incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, less shares from assumed proceeds. The assumed
proceeds calculation includes actual proceeds to be received from the employee upon exercise, the average unrecognized stock compensation cost during the period
and any tax benefits that will be credited upon exercise to additional paid-in capital.
For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in the calculation of net income (loss) per share, 0.1 million , 1.5 million and 2.8 million shares,
respectively, subject to stock options and restricted stock awards and units were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share as they were
anti-dilutive.
