(1) Revenue as part of a settlement of a patent infringement dispute from previously unlicensed parties was previously classiﬁed as past production payments,
which was deﬁned as royalty payments for the use of our intellectual property. This revenue has been reclassiﬁed and is included in "Royalty and license fees."
The following table sets forth our revenues by year (in thousands, except for percentages):

The $5.5 million or 2% decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in episodic revenue of $98.0 million which was partially offset by an increase in recurring
revenue of $92.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Recurring revenue was up $92.5 million primarily
as a result of our settlement agreements with Amkor and PTI and the license agreements entered into with Micron in July 2014. The episodic revenue decrease was
primarily the result of aggregate episodic payments of $96.0 million made by PTI in the first and third quarter of 2014 in connection with Tessera, Inc.'s settlement
with PTI, and an episodic payment made in connection with the execution of a license agreement in the ﬁrst quarter of 20 14, which was partially offset by a $27.0
million episodic payment made by ASE in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of direct compensation and related expenses to provide non-recurring engineering ("NRE") services. We anticipate these expenses will
continue to be a low percentage of total revenue as our NRE services are not a signiﬁcant portion of our revenues.
Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.6 million, as compared to $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.2
million, or 47%. The increase related to direct labor from non-recurring engineering services associated with a contract that was signed in the fourth quarter of
20 14.
