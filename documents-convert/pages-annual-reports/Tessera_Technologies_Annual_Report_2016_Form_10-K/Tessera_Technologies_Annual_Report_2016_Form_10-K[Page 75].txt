federal research tax credit will start to expire in 2020, and will continue to expire through 2033. The Company also has research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $5.4 million for state purposes and $1.3 million for foreign purposes, which under current law will not expire. The Company has $5.6 million of
foreign tax credit carryforwards which will expire in 2023. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, substantial changes in the Company or its
subsidiaries’ ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable
income.
In 2015, the Company reduced the California net operating loss carryforwards by $45.0 million resulting from the Gillette Co. vs. Franchise Tax Board court case
that was concluded by the California Supreme Court on December 31, 2015. The California Supreme Court concluded that the Multistate Tax Compact’s three
factor equal weighted formula apportionment method was an improper method, and the single sales factor method enacted in 2011 was held to be the proper
method to apportion income to California. Accordingly, the Company reduced its California net operating loss carryforward to reﬂect the California Supreme
Court decision. This reduction of California net operating loss carryforwards does not impact the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated
Statement of Operations.
The Company plans to permanently reinvest the unremitted earnings of its non-US. subsidiaries except for the Company's Israel subsidiary where the closure of
this subsidiary is imminent following the Company's announcement to restructure its DigitalOptics business and cease its MEMS manufacturing operations. The
Company has accrued a deferred tax liability of $0.1 million for the withholding taxes that would arise on the distribution of the Israel subsidiary's earnings.
As of December 31, 2015, unrecognized tax benefits approximated $3.1 million , (which is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet), of which $2.4 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2014, unrecognized tax benefits approximated $2.7 million , of
which $1.1 million would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2015, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may
decrease by $0.2 million in the next 12 months due to the expected lapse of statute of limitation relating to foreign tax incentives.

It is the Company's policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. For the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Company recognized an insignificant amount of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. For the years
ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company accrued $0.5 million and $0.5 million , respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits.
At December 31, 2015, the Company’s 2010 through 2015 tax years were open and subject to potential examination in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, in the
US, any net operating losses or credits that were generated in prior years but utilized in an open year may also be subject to examination. The Company recently
completed an Internal Revenue Service examination related to its 2008 and 2009 tax returns which resulted in minimal changes to the statement of operations. The
audit was settled last year but the Company is currently disputing the interest calculation for the audit assessment amount. The Company is currently under an
Internal Revenue Service examination for the 2010 - 2013 tax years. The Company also is currently under examination in California for the 2011 and 2012 tax
years. The Company cannot estimate the financial outcome of the Internal Revenue Service and California examinations. The Company is not currently under
foreign income tax examination.
