As of January 28, 2016 there were 52,305,378 outstanding shares of common stock held by 22 stockholders of record.
In February 2015, we updated our capital allocation strategy. Given the change in business approach that moves us away from backward looking “episodic”
payments, we discontinued the once-a-year payment of special dividends on episodic proceeds and instead announced a doubling of the current quarterly dividend
to $0.20 per share which began in March 2015. The Company also returns capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and plans to continue repurchasing
stock in future periods. We anticipate that all quarterly dividends and stock repurchases will be paid out of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
In 2014, we paid quarterly dividends of $0. 10 per share in each of March 2014, May 2014, August 2014 and December 2014. In May 2014, we also paid a special
dividend of $0.52 per common share. In 2015, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share in each of March 2015, May 2015, August 2015 and December 2015.
