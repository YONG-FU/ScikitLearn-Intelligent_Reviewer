At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had a valuation allowance of $13.9 million and $27.1 million , respectively, related to federal, state, and foreign tax
attributes that the Company believes to be not realizable on a more-likely-than-not basis. The decrease of $13.2 million was due to a valuation allowance that was
released against certain deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of Ireland deferred tax assets, as the Company concluded such assets were realizable. The need for
a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets
are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction—by-jurisdiction basis. In making such assessment, signiﬁcant weight is given to evidence that can be
objectively verified. After considering both negative and positive evidence to assess the recoverability of the Company's net deferred tax assets during the 2015
year, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that it would realize certain deferred tax assets given current certainties regarding the timing of
profits and forecasted future profitability within the Ireland tax jurisdiction. The Company will continue to monitor the likelihood that it will be able to recover the
deferred tax assets in the future, including those for which a valuation allowance is still recorded. This determination includes objectively verifiable positive
evidence that outweighs potential negative evidence.
