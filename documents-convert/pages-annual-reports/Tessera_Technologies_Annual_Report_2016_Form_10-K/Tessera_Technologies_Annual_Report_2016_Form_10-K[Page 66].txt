Ziptronix
On August 27, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Ziptronix, Inc. (“Ziptronix”) for approximately $39 million in cash, net of $1.5 million in working
capital (which includes $1.9 million in cash) acquired. Approximately $0.7 million of the consideration was withheld until certain employees complete the term of
their employment obligations. The acquisition expands the Company's existing advanced packaging capabilities by adding a low-temperature wafer bonding
technology platform that will accelerate delivery of 2.5D and 3D-IC solutions to semiconductor industry customers.
Ziptronix’s patented ZiBond® direct bonding and DBI® hybrid bonding technologies deliver scalable, low total cost-of-ownership manufacturing solutions for 3D
stacking. Ziptronix’s intellectual property has been licensed to Sony Corporation for volume production of CMOS image sensors. Ziptronix’s technology is also
relevant to next-generation stacked memory, 2.5D FPGAs, RF F ront-End and MEMS devices, among other semiconductor applications. The significant future
market opportunity for the Company to own Ziptronix contributed to a purchase price in excess of the fair value of the underlying net assets and identified
intangible assets acquired from Ziptronix and, as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. The business combination
transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
