During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company granted stock options covering 84,000 , 220,000 and 1,204,000 shares, respectively. The
2015, 2014 and 2013 estimated per share fair value of those grants was $8.57 , $5.71 and $6.82 , respectively, before estimated forfeitures.
The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $7.7 million , $5.5 million and $5.0 million ,
respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $9.3 million , $13.3 million and $6.8 million ,
respectively. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the shares.
As of December 31, 2015, the unrecognized stock-based compensation balance after estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options was $3.0 million to be
recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years and $11.1 million related to restricted stock awards and units, including
performance-based awards and units, to be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years . As of December 31, 2014, the
unrecognized stock-based compensation balance after estimated forfeitures related to unvested stock options was $5.0 million to be recognized over an estimated
weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years and $5.4 million related to restricted stock awards and units, including performance-based awards and units, to
be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years .
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of options. The fair value of each option grant is determined on
the date of grant and the expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. The assumptions used in the model include expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rate, and
dividend yield. The Company’s determinations of these assumptions are outlined below.
Expected life — The expected life assumption is based on analysis of the Company’s historical employee exercise patterns. The expected life of options granted
under the ESPP represents the offering period of two years.
Volatility — Volatility is calculated using the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock for a term consistent with the expected life. Historical
volatility of the Company’s common stock is also utilized for the ESPP.
Risk-free interest rate — The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on the US. Treasury rate for issues with remaining terms similar to the expected life of
the options.
Dividend yield — Expected dividend yield is calculated based on cash dividends declared by the Board for the previous four quarters and dividing that result by
the average closing price of the Company’s common stock for the quarter. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock units or unvested restricted stock
awards.
In addition, the Company estimates forfeiture rates. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from
those estimates. Historical data is used to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are
expected to vest.
