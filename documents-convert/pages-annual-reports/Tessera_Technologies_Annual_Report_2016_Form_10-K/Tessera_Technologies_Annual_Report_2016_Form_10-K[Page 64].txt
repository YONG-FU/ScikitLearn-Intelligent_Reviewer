NOTE 7 — FAIR VALUE
The Company follows the authoritative guidance fair value measurement and the fair value option for ﬁnancial assets and financial liabilities. Fair value is deﬁned
as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or an exit price, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The established fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair
value:
Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets. Level 3 assets and
liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash ﬂow methodologies, or similar
techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs. We calculate the fair value of our Level 1 and Level 2 instruments based on the exchange traded price of similar or identical instruments, where available,
or based on other observable inputs. There were no significant transfers into or out of Level 1 or Level 2 that occurred between December 31, 2014 and December
3 1, 2015.
