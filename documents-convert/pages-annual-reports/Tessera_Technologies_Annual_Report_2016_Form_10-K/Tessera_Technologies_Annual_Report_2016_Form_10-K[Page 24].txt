Ziptronix, Inc. v. Omnivision Technologies, Inc. et al. , Civil Action No. 4:10-cv—05525 (N.D. Cal.)
On December 6, 2010 Ziptronix, Inc. (“Ziptronix”) ﬁled a complaint against Omnivision Technologies, Inc. (“Omnivision”), Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corporation, Ltd. and TSMC North America Corp. (collectively, “TSMC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Ziptronix’s complaint asserted that Omnivision and TSMC infringed Ziptronix’s U.S. Patent Nos. 6,864,585, 7,037,755, 7,335,572, 7,387,944, 7,553,744,
7,807,549.
On May 4, 2011, Omnivision and TSMC ﬁled their answers and affirmative defenses to Ziptronix’s first amended complaint, and TSMC asserted counterclaims
alleging that Ziptronix infringed TSMC’s U.S. Patent Nos. 6,682,981, 7,307,020, 6,765,279, 7,385,835, and 6,350,694. All of these TSMC patents, except for U.S.
Patent No. 6,350,694, have expired. On November 8, 2011, TSMC amended its counterclaims, and Ziptronix answered TSMC’s amended counterclaims on
December 9, 2011.
On April 24, 2012, Ziptronix sought leave to file a second amended complaint asserting that Omnivision and TSMC also infringed Ziptronix’s U.S. Patent Nos.
7,871,898, 8,053,329, and 8,153,505. The Court granted Ziptronix leave to ﬁle its second amended complaint on August 2, 2012.
On January 22, 2014, TSMC filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that any allegedly infringing activities of TSMC do not occur in the United States and
thus such activities are not subject to the U.S. patent laws. The Court granted TSMC’s motion on September 30, 2014. On October 22, 2014, Omnivision ﬁled a
similar motion for summary judgment concerning certain of its allegedly extraterritorial infringing activities. The Court granted Omnivision’s motion on March 2,
2015. Neither TSMC’s nor Omnivision’s motions for summary judgment, nor the Court’s related orders, addressed substantive issues of infringement (i.e. whether
TSMC’s or Omnivision’s products practice Ziptronix’s patents), or the validity of the asserted Ziptronix patents.
Claim construction issues were fully briefed as of November 2012, and are under submission. Fact and expert discovery remain open. A case management
conference is currently scheduled for March 16, 2016. No trial date has been scheduled.
Reexamination Proceedings
U.S. Patent No. 6,465,893
On February 15, 2007, Siliconware Precision Industries Co. Ltd and Siliconware USA Inc. (collectively “SPIL”) filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce
(“PTO”) a request for inter partes reexamination relating to US Patent No. 6,465,893. On May 4, 2007, the PTO granted the request. On February 15, 2008, the
PTO issued an official action, denominated as an action closing prosecution, rejecting a number of patent claims of U.S. Patent No. 6,465,893. Following
additional proceedings, a Right of Appeal Notice was issued on February 18, 2011.
Tessera, Inc. ﬁled a Notice of Appeal on March 3, 2011, and SPIL ﬁled a Notice of Cross Appeal on March 7, 2011. On December 21, 2012, the Patent Trial and
Appeal Board issued a Decision on Appeal, affirming the Examiner’s previous holding of unpatentability as to some claims, reversing the Examiner’s favorable
decision of patentability as to other claims by rejecting those claims on new grounds of rejection, and affirming the Examiner’s favorable decision of patentability
as to still other claims. On May 9, 2013, SPIL withdrew from the inter partes reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 6,465,893.
