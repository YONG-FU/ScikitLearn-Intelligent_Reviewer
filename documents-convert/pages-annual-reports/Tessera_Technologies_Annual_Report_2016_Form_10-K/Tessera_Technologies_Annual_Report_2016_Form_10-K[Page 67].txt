NOTE 9 — GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In March 2013, the Company revised its business strategy for the DigitalOptics business to concentrate its manufacturing efforts on the lens barrel, rather than the
whole camera module. This revised strategy made the Zhuhai Facility unnecessary. The Company announced the closure of the Zhuhai Facility in March 2013.
This decision triggered an impairment review of the related goodwill and purchased intangible assets. As a result of the Company's impairment assessment,
completed in the first quarter of 2013, the Company recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of $6.7 million .
In 2015, the Company assessed goodwill impairment for its reporting unit. As of September 30, 2015, the Company assessed goodwill impairment for its reporting
unit by performing a qualitative assessment and no impairment of goodwill was indicated as the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair
value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount. In addition, there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill
subsequent to the qualitative assessment performed in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015.
