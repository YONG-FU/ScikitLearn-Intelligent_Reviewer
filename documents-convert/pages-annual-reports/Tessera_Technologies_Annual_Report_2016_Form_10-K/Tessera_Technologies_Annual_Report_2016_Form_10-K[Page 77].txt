These existing and any future legal actions may harm the Company’s business. For example, they could result in counterclaims against the Company, cause an
existing licensee or strategic partner to cease making royalty or other payments to the Company, or cause an existing licensee or strategic partner to challenge the
validity and enforceability of patents owned by the Company’s subsidiaries or the scope of license agreements with the Company’s subsidiaries. Litigation
accordingly could signiﬁcantly damage the Company’s relationship with such licensee or strategic partner and, as a result, prevent the adoption of the Company’s
other technologies by such licensee or strategic partner. Litigation could also severely disrupt or shut down the business operations of licensees or strategic partners
of the Company’s subsidiaries, which in turn would signiﬁcantly harm ongoing relations with them and cause the Company to lose royalty revenues.
The costs associated with legal proceedings are typically high, relatively unpredictable and not completely within the Company’s control. These costs may be
materially higher than expected, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and lead to volatility in the price of its common stock. Whether or
not determined in the Company’s favor or ultimately settled, litigation diverts managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from the Company’s business
operations. Furthermore, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could result in a loss of the Company’s proprietary rights, subject the Company to
signiﬁcant liabilities, require the Company to seek licenses from others, limit the value of the Company’s licensed technology or otherwise negatively impact the
Company’s stock price or its business and consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
NOTE 15 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, following the Company’s actions to cease manufacturing operations in the DigitalOptics business, the Company determined that it
operates its business in one operating segment, focused on the monetization of intellectual property, both internally developed and acquired, through royalties,
licenses and other means. Previously, the Company operated in two operating segments - Intellectual Property and DigitalOptics. The Company's chief operating
decision maker is the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, who reviews ﬁnancial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and
