The following table presents our quarterly unaudited non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures for the eight quarters in the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The
non-GAAP financial measures adjust for non-cash acquired intangibles, amortization charges, acquired in-process research and development, all forms of stock-
based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and other charges and related tax effects of the aforementioned adjustments. The non-
GAAP financial measures also exclude the effects of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 — Stock Compensation upon the number of diluted
shares used in calculating non-GAAP earnings per share. We believe that the non-GAAP measures used in this report provide investors with important
perspectives into our ongoing business performance. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating our operating performance. The
non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-
GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by
other companies.

We deﬁne recurring revenue as payments made pursuant to a license agreement or other agreement that are scheduled to occur over at least one year of time. We
define episodic revenue as non-recurring since it is not payable over at least one year pursuant to a contract. Episodic revenue includes non-recurring items such as
engineering fees, initial license fees, back payments resulting from audits, damages awards from courts or other tribunals, and lump sum settlement payments.
Although the royalty revenue reported by our licensees on a quarterly basis is generally not assured, for ease of reference, we refer to these revenues as “recurring
revenue.”
We believe that presenting episodic and recurring revenue information provides both management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying
operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations, as well as results due to unique items that can obscure underlying trends. Management recognizes
that the term “episodic revenue” may be interpreted differently by other companies and may not be applicable under different circumstances. We believe that these
measures are
