Stock Option Plans
The 2003 Plan
In February 2003, the Board adopted and the Company’s stockholders approved the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (“2003 Plan”). Under the 2003 Plan, incentive
stock options may be granted to the Company’s employees at an exercise price of no less than 100% of the fair value on the date of grant, and non-statutory stock
options may be granted to the Company’s employees, non-employee directors and consultants at an exercise price of no less than 85% of the fair value. In both
cases, when the optionees own stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the exercise price shall be no less
than 110% of the fair value on the date of grant. Options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units granted under this plan generally have a term of ten
years from the date of grant and vest over a four -year period. Restricted stock, performance awards, dividend equivalents, deferred stock, stock payments and
stock appreciation rights may also be granted under the 2003 Plan either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with any options granted thereunder. Restricted stock
awards and units are full-value awards that reduce the number of shares reserved for grant under this plan by one and one-half shares for each share granted. The
vesting criteria for restricted stock awards and units is generally the passage of time or meeting certain performance-based objectives, and continued employment
through the vesting period generally over four years. As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 3.9 million shares reserved for future grant under this
plan.
