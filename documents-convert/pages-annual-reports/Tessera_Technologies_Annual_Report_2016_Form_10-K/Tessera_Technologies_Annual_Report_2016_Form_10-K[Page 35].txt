Our restructuring activities in 2014 and 2013 were undertaken because we exited the manufacturing portion of our business. We determined that focusing our
resources on our core business of monetizing our intellectual property would bring more shareholder value.
Stock-based Compensation Expense
The following table sets forth our stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2014 2013
lCost of revenues $ 18 l l$ 50 1
Research, development and other related costs 2,823 3,591
’Selling, general and administrative 10,428 1 I 9,862 1
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 13,269 $ 13,503
Stock-based compensation awards included employee stock options, restricted stock awards and units, and employee stock purchases. For the year ended
December 31, 2014, stock-based compensation expense was $13.3 million, of which $3.3 million related to employee stock options, $9.3 million related to
restricted stock awards and units and $0.6 million related to employee stock purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2013, stock-based compensation expense
was $13.5 million , of which $7.8 million related to employee stock options, $4.3 million related to restricted stock awards and units and $1.4 million related to
employee stock purchases.
Other Income and Expense, Net
Other income and expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.6 million, as compared to $1.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2013. Other
income and expense primarily consists of interest income which was ﬂat year over year at $1.2 million.
Provision for (beneﬁt from) Income Taxes
The beneﬁt for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $7.7 million was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance for federal deferred
tax assets which offset the tax expense related to our 2014 pre-tax profits. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2013 of $35.9 million
was primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance on federal deferred taxes in 2013 as a result of the determination that it was more likely than not that
the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining
whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In making such
assessment, signiﬁcant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. After considering both negative and positive evidence to assess the
recoverability of our net deferred tax assets during the year 2014, we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize the full value of substantially all
our federal deferred tax assets given license agreements and settlements entered into with customers during 2014 as well as cost reductions favorably impacting our
profitability in 2014 and forecasted proﬁtability in succeeding years. We continue to monitor the likelihood that we will be able to recover the deferred tax assets in
the future. This determination includes objectively veriﬁable positive evidence that outweighs potential negative evidence.
Discontinued Operations
In 2013, we sold our Micro-Optics business located in Charlotte, North Carolina, and shut-down our camera module manufacturing facility in Zhuhai, China. In
2014, we ceased all memslcam manufacturing operations. In 2014, and all previous periods presented, these operations are reported as discontinued operations. For
further information about discontinued operations, see Note 6 — " Discontinued Operations " and Note 16 - “ Restructuring, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
Other Charges and Gain on Sale of Patents ” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.
