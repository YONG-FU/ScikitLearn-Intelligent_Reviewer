Stock-based Compensation Expense
The following table sets forth our stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2015 2014
lCost of revenues $ — ‘ l$ 18 l
Research, development and other related costs 4,005 2,823
’Selling, general and administrative 7,512 l 1 10,428 l
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 11,517 $ 13,269
Stock-based compensation awards included employee stock options, restricted stock awards and units, and employee stock purchases. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, stock-based compensation expense was $11.5 million, of which $2.7 million related to employee stock options, $8.2 million related to
restricted stock awards and units and $0.6 million related to employee stock purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, stock-based compensation expense
was $13.3 million, of which $3.3 million related to employee stock options, $9.3 million related to restricted stock awards and units and $0.6 million related to
employee stock purchases. The decrease in stock based compensation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 results from performance shares awarded to executives,
with lower achievement levels reached in 2015 than 2014.
Future stock-based compensation expense will vary due to volatility in our stock price, number and type of stock awards granted and timing of modifications to
stock awards, if any.
Other Income and Expense, Net
Other income and expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.4 million, as compared to $1.6 million, for the year ended December 31, 2014. This
increase resulted from higher interest income due to higher interest rates achieved from extending the average maturity of our portfolio and from interest rates
rising in general during 2015.
Provision for (beneﬁt from) Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $48.5 million is primarily due to tax liability generated from US. and foreign operations,
and foreign withholding taxes, offset by the benefit from the release of valuation allowance primarily related to Ireland deferred tax assets. The beneﬁt from
income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $7.7 million was primarily due to the release of valuation allowance on US. federal deferred tax assets
offset by foreign withholding tax and foreign income taxes. The increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior
year is largely attributable to the signiﬁcantly greater release in valuation allowance in the prior year as compared to the current year. The need for a valuation
allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are
recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction—by-jurisdiction basis. In making such assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be
objectively veriﬁed. After considering both positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets during the year 2015, we have
determined that it is more likely than not we would realize certain other deferred tax assets (primarily related to Ireland deferred tax assets) given the timing of
profits and forecasted proﬁtability in succeeding years. We continue to monitor the likelihood that we will be able to recover the deferred tax assets in the future.
This determination includes objectively verifiable positive evidence that outweighs potential negative evidence.
