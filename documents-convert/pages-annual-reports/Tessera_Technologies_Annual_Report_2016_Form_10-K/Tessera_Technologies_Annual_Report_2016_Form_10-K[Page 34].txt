in recurring revenue results from a $39.2 million increase from new license agreements primarily with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Micron Technology, Inc.
and a $12.3 million or 113% increase in revenue from our FotoNation subsidiary resulting from new license agreements to our software products as well as growth
in unit shipments under software license agreements.
