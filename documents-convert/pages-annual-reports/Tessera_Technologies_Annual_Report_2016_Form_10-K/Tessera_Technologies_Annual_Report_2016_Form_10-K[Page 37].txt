The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and to maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return. To
achieve these objectives, we maintain a diversiﬁed portfolio of debt securities including municipal bonds and notes, corporate bonds and notes, commercial paper,
treasury and agency notes and bills, certificates of deposit and money market funds. We invest excess cash predominantly in high-quality investment grade debt
securities with less than three years to maturity. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair values for our securities are determined based on quoted market prices as of
the valuation date and observable prices for similar assets.
We evaluate our investments periodically for possible other-than-temporary impairment and review factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value
has been below cost basis, the ﬁnancial condition of the issuer, our ability and intent to hold the security until maturity on a more likely than not basis. If declines
in the fair value of the investments are determined to be other-than-temporary, we report the credit loss portion of such decline in other income and expense, on a
net basis, and the remaining noncredit loss portion in accumulated other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no
impairment charges with respect to our investments were recorded.
In August 2007, our Board of Directors ("the Board") authorized a plan to repurchase our outstanding shares of common stock dependent on market conditions,
share price and other factors. No expiration has been speciﬁed for this plan. As of December 31, 2015, we have repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares of
common stock, since the inception of the plan, at a total cost of $224.1 million under this plan at an average price of $27.22. As of December 31, 2015, the total
amount available for repurchase was $25.9 million. In January 2016, the Board authorized an additional $200.0 million in future repurchases under the plan. We
plan to continue to execute authorized repurchases from time to time under the plan.
