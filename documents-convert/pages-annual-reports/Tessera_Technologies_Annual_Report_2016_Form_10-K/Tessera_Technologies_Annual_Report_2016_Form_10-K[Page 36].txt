Net Operating Losses and Tax Credit Carryforwards
As of December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.0 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $64.8 million. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are carried over from Ziptronix, Inc., acquired in 2015. The state net operating loss
carryforwards are carried over from acquired entities, Siimpel Corporation in 2010 and Ziptronix, Inc. in 2015. These operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized,
will begin to expire on various dates beginning in 2016, and will continue to expire through 2031. In addition, we have research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $0.3 million for federal purposes which were carried over from Ziptronix, Inc. The federal research tax credit will start to expire in 2020 and
continue to expire through 2033. We also have research tax credit carryforwards, which under current law will not expire, of approximately $5.4 million for state
purposes and $1.3 million for foreign purposes. We have $5.6 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards which will expire in 2023. Under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code, substantial changes in the Company or its subsidiaries' ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss and research tax credit
carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income.
Tax Effect from Stock Options
The tax effect from the Company's employee stock option plan for the year ended December 31, 2015 is a deﬁciency totaling $0.1 million. The tax effect in 2014
was a deficiency of $2.0 million, and in 2013 there was no tax effect from the Company's employee stock option plan. The tax benefits for the excess of tax
deductions over the related stock-based compensation expense recorded will create a benefit to additional paid-in capital in the year that the benefit will reduce
taxes payable. The Company recorded a credit of $0.7 million, tax-effected, to additional paid-in capital due to the realization of the windfall tax benefits in the
current period.
