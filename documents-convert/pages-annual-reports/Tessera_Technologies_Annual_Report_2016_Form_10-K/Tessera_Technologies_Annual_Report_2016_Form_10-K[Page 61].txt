At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company had $381.7 million and $434.4 million , respectively, in cash, cash equivalents and short—term
investments. The majority of these amounts were held in marketable securities, as shown above. The remaining balance of $21.9 million and $19.5 million at
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, was cash held in operating accounts not included in the tables above.
The gross realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities were not significant during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
Unrealized losses (net of unrealized gains) of $0.9 million , net of tax, as of December 31, 2015, were related to a temporary decrease in value of the remaining
available-for-sale securities and were due primarily to changes in interest rates and market and credit conditions of the underlying securities. Certain investments
with a temporary decline in value are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2015 because the Company has the ability to hold
these investments to allow for recovery, and does not anticipate having to sell these securities with unrealized losses and continues to receive interest at the
maximum contractual rate. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to its
marketable securities.
The following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses related to individual available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2015 and 2014, which
have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, aggregated by investment category and length of time (in thousands):
