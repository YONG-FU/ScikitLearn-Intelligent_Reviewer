Lease and Purchase Commitments
The Company leases ofﬁce and research facilities and ofﬁce equipment under operating leases which expire at various dates through 2020. The amounts reﬂected
in the table below are for the aggregate future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable facility and equipment operating leases. Under lease agreements that
contain escalating rent provisions, lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014
and 2013 amounted to $2.1 million , $3.6 million and $3.9 million , respectively.
As of December 31, 2015, future minimum lease payments are as follows (in thousands):

Contingencies
At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the
provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. The Company is currently unable to predict the final outcome of these
lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss. An adverse decision in any of these proceedings could
significantly harm the Company’s business and consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
Tessera, Inc. v. Toshiba Corporation, Civil Action No. 5:15-cv—02543-BLF (N.D. Cal.)
On May 12, 2015, Tessera, Inc. filed a complaint against Toshiba Corporation (“Toshiba”) in California Superior Court, in Santa Clara County. Tessera, Inc. ’s
complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and declaratory relief, generally alleging
that Toshiba underpaid royalties and failed to cooperate with audits conducted pursuant to the parties’ license agreement.
On June 8, 2015, Toshiba removed the action to the US District Court for the Northern District of California.
On June 18, 2015, Toshiba filed its answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaims to Tessera, Inc.’s complaint. Toshiba alleges counterclaims for declaratory
judgment and breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing. The counterclaims seek, among other things, judicial determinations about the
interpretation of the parties’ agreement, termination of the agreement, an accounting of the amount of alleged overpayments by Toshiba, restitution, and damages.
On July 10, 2015, Tessera, Inc. filed its answer and affirmative defenses to Toshiba’s counterclaims.

Other Litigation Matters
The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation matters and claims in the normal course of business. In the past, the Company and its subsidiaries have
litigated to enforce their respective patents and other intellectual property rights, to enforce the terms of license agreements, to protect trade secrets, to determine
the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others and to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. The Company expects it or its subsidiaries will
be involved in similar legal proceedings in the future, including proceedings regarding infringement of its patents and proceedings to ensure proper and full
