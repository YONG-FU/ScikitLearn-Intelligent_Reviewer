Revenues
Our revenues are generated primarily from royalty and license fees. Royalty and license fees are generated from licensing the right to use our technologies or
intellectual property. Licensees generally report shipment information 30 to 60 days after the end of the quarter in which such activity takes place. Since there is no
reliable basis on which we can estimate our royalty revenues prior to obtaining these reports from the licensees, we generally recognize royalty revenues on a one
quarter lag. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized for each type of revenues depends upon a variety of factors,
including the specific terms of each arrangement, our ability to derive fair value of each element and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. In addition, our
royalty revenues will ï¬‚uctuate based on a number of factors such as: (a) the timing of receipt of royalty reports; (b) the rate of adoption and incorporation of our
technology by licensees; (c) the demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology; (d) the cyclicality of supply and demand for
products using our licensed technology; (e) volume incentive pricing terms in licensing agreements that may result in significant variability in quarterly revenue
recognition from customers and (f) the impact of economic downturns.
From time to time we enter into license agreements that have fixed expiration dates. Upon expiration of such agreements, we need to renew or replace these
agreements in order to maintain our revenue base. We may not be able to continue licensing customers on terms favorable to us, under the existing terms or at all,
which would harm our results of operations.
In the past, we have engaged in litigation and arbitration proceedings to directly or indirectly enforce our intellectual property rights and the terms of our license
agreements, including proceedings to ensure proper and full payment of royalties by our current licensees and by third parties whose products incorporate our
intellectual property rights.
