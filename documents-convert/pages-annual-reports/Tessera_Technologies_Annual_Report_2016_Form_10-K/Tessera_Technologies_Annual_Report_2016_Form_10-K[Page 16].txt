Our technology may be too expensive for certain next generation high performance DRAM manufacturers, which could significantly reduce the adoption rate of
our technology in next generation high performance DRAM chips. Even if our technology is selected for at least some of these next generation high performance
DRAM chips, there could be delays in the introduction of products utilizing these chips that could materially affect the amount and timing of any royalty payments
that we receive. Other factors that could affect adoption of our technology for next generation high performance DRAM products include delays or shortages of
materials and equipment and the availability of testing services.
Our ﬁnancial and operating results may vary, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.
Our quarterly operating results have ﬂuctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future. Because our operating results are difficult to predict, one should not
rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could cause our operating results to
ﬂuctuate during any period or that could adversely affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives include those listed in this “ Risk Factors " section of this
report and the following:
the timing of, and compliance with license or service agreements and the terms and conditions for payment to us of license or service fees under
* these agreements;
* ﬂuctuations in our royalties caused by the pricing terms of certain of our license agreements;
changes in our royalties caused by changes in demand for products incorporating semiconductors or wireless devices that use our licensed
* technology;
* the amount of our product and service revenues;
* changes in the level of our operating expenses;
* delays in our introduction of new technologies or market acceptance of these new technologies through new license agreements;
* our ability to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or the terms of our agreements;
* legal proceedings affecting our patents, patent applications or license agreements;
* the timing of the introduction by others of competing technologies;
* changes in demand for semiconductor chips in the specific end markets in which we concentrate;
* changes in demand for camera-enabled devices including cell phones, security systems and personal computers;
* the timing of the conclusion of license agreements;
* the length of time it takes to establish new licensing arrangements;
* meeting the requirements for revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles;
