NOTE 16 — RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT OF LON G—LIVED ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES AND GAIN ON SALE OF PATENTS
In 2013, the Company continued reorganizing the DigitalOptics segment by closing its manufacturing operation in Zhuhai, China, and selling a signiﬁcant portion
of the assets of the Company's Micro-Optics business based in Charlotte, North Carolina. On January 16, 2014, the Company announced a restructuring of its
DigitalOptics segment to cease all remaining manufacturing operations resulting in impairment charges related to the Company's long-lived assets. For the year
ended December 31, 2013, the Company incurred cumulative charges, which include continuing and discontinued operations in total, of $5.9 million in severance
and $70.9 million in impairment of long-lived assets and other charges.
In 2014, the Company recorded a gain of $1 1.9 million on patents sold in 2014. Prior to the sale, these patents were included in the Company's patent portfolio
available for licensing. This gain was partially offset by approximately $1.5 million in restructuring charges for severance and other facility costs related to
reduction in administrative personnel.
