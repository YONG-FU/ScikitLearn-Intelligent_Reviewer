adopt such poison pill; provided, however, that this Board may act on its own to adopt a poison pill without 3:)
first submitting such matter to a stockholder vote if, under the circumstance then existing, this Board in the 0-
exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities deems it to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders
to adopt a poison pill without the delay in adoption that is attendant upon the time reasonably anticipated to .
seek a stockholder vote. If a poison pill is adopted without first submitting such matter to a stockholder vote,
the poison pi|| must be submitted to a stockholder vote within one year after the effective date of the poison
pi||. Absent such submission to a stockholder vote, and favorable action thereupon, the poison pill will expire
on the first anniversary of its effective date."
