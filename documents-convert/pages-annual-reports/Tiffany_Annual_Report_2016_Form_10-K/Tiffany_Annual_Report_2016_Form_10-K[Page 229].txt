Fair Market Value of a Share as of the Pricing Date. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the "Pricing
Date" shall be the date on which the Option is granted unless the Option is granted on a date on which
the principal exchange on which the Stock is then listed or admitted to trading is closed for trading, in
