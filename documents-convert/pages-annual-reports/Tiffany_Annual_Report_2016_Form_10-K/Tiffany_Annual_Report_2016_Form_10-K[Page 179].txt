Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Granted for Fiscal 2016,. 2015 and 2014
Vesting of PSUs granted in January 2016, 2015 and 2014 is dependent upon the achievement of an EPS
threshold. If the EPS threshold is not met, no shares will vest. The Committee has provided guidance to the
executive officers indicating that, if the EPS threshold is met, it intends to calculate the number of shares to
vest based on achievement of EPS goals and an average ROA goal over the applicable three-year performance
period. The Committee provided the following chart to the NEOs to illustrate the manner in which the number
of shares to vest would be calculated at the conclusion of the three-year performance period, subject to
interpolation if actual amounts fall between the levels shown:

The EPS and ROA goals for the January 2014, 2015 and 2016 grants were set by the Committee in March of
each respective year, with reference to the Company's strategic plan as approved by the Board. The EPS goals .
are cumulative over the three-year performance period and determined on a diluted basis. The ROA goal is
calculated for each year, as a percentage, and then averaged over each of the three years in the performance
period. The EPS and ROA goals for the PSUs granted in January 2014, 2015 and 2016, compared to the EPS
goals established for the PSUs granted in January 2017, are shown below. The goals are subject to adjustment
as permitted under the applicable employee incentive plan.
