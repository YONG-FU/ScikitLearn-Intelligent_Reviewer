The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for
income taxes. During the year ended January 31, 2017, the Company recognized no expense associated with interest LL
and penalties while during the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized approximately
$1.7 million and $1.8 million of expense. Accrued interest and penalties are included within accounts payable and
accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, and were $8.3 million and $7.8 million at January 31, 2017 and
2016. * ‘
At January 31, 2017, the Company's gross uncertain tax positions decreased $6.8 million and gross accrued interest
and penalties were unchanged from January 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the conclusion of a tax examination
during the three months ended April 30, 2016. This settlement resulted in an income tax benefit of $6.6 million for
the year ended January 31, 2017, and reduced the effective income tax rate by 1.0 percentage point versus the
prior year.
The Company conducts business globally, and, as a result, is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and
foreign jurisdictions. As a matter of course, tax authorities regularly audit the Company. The Company's tax filings
are currently being examined by a number of tax authorities in several jurisdictions, both in the U.S. and in foreign
jurisdictions. Ongoing audits where subsidiaries have a material presence include New York City (tax years 201 1—
2013) and New York State (tax years 2012—2014). Tax years from 2010—present are open to examination in the
U.S. Federal jurisdiction and 2006—present are open in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As part of these
audits, the Company engages in discussions with taxing authorities regarding tax positions. At January 31, 2017,
total unrecognized tax benefits were $3.4 million of which approximately $1.0 million, if recognized, would affect
the effective income tax rate. As of January 31, 2017, unrecognized tax benefits are not expected to change
materially in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment.
