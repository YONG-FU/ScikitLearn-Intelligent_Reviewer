0 Other changes to grant terms. RSUs and PSUs will be credited with dividend equivalent units that will
be converted into shares (with fractional units being paid out in cash) upon vesting of the underlying
stock units. This change is designed to permit executives to participate in total shareholder return, in
alignment with the interests of shareholders, and supports the balanced consideration of share
repurchases and dividend payments in capital allocation decisions.
0 In the event of an executive's voluntary retirement at age 65 (or age 55 with 10 years of service), or
involuntary termination without cause following at least 10 years of service as an executive, stock options
and PS Us granted at least six months prior to retirement or termination will continue to vest in accordance
with their terms, and the exercise period applicable to vested options will be five years (not to exceed
the original expiration date). For grants made in the prior fiscal year, retirement resulted in forfeiture of
unvested stock options, the application of a two-year exercise period to any vested stock options (not to
exceed the expiration date), and continued pro rata vesting of PS Us; while involuntary termination without
cause resulted in forfeiture of unvested stock options, application of a three-month exercise period to
any vested options (not to exceed the expiration date), and Committee discretion to permit continued
pro rata vesting of PS Us. These changes—the benefits of which are subject to compliance with restrictive
covenants — were made to advance the Company's goals of attracting and retaining talent and ensuring
executives remain focused on the Company's long-term performance.
