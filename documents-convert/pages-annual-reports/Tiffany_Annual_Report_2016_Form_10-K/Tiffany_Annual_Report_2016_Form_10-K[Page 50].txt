a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and
an) maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. Contingent rent for the year ended January 31, 2017
totaled $32.4 million. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitment and
Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company’s operating leases.
g b) The Company will, from time to time, enter into arrangements to purchase rough diamonds that contain
minimum purchase obligations. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been
estimated at approximately $60.0 million for 2017 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2017 that are
contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated.
c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts
fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs.
cl) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-
progress and packaging supplies.
e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium.
The summary above does not include the following items:
0 Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations.
The Company funds the Qualified Plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current
service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit
accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the
Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution was required in
2016, and none is required in 2017, to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). However, the Company periodically evaluates whether to make
discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan and made a voluntary cash contribution of $120.0
million in 2016 but currently does not anticipate making such contributions in 2017. This expectation is
subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to,
asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company estimates cash
payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1.9 million in 2017.
0 Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2017 of $3.4 million and accrued interest and penalties of $8.3
million. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax
examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company
believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these
matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may
result in the Company owing additional taxes. At January 31, 2017, approximately $1.0 million of total
unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. As of January 31, 2017,
