Notes to Pension Benefits Table
(a) Only executive officers hired prior to January 1, 2006 are eligible for participation in the Pension Plan, Excess
E Plan, and Supplemental Plan. Messrs. Cumenal, Erceg, Nicoletti, Bellaiche and Galtie accordingly do not participate
C3 in these plans.
Q (b) The formal names of the plans are: the Tiffany and Company Pension Plan ("Pension Plan"), the 2004 Tiffany and
E Company Un-funded Retirement Income Plan to Recognize Compensation in Excess of Internal Revenue Code
Limits and the 1994 Tiffany and Company Supplemental Retirement Income Plan.
Assumptions Used in Calculating the Present Value of the Accumulated Benefits
The assumptions used in the Pension Benefit Table are that an active executive would retire at age 65; post-retirement
mortality based upon the RP-2014 Male/Female Mortality Table with White Collar Adjustments regressed to base year
2006 and projected generationally from 2006 with Scale MP-2016; and a discount rate of 4.25% for the Pension Plan
and 4.25% for the Excess and Supplemental Plans. All assumptions were consistent with those used to prepare the
financial statements for Fiscal 2016, except for the retirement age assumption, which represents the normal retirement
age under these plans.
Features of the Pension Benefit Plans
Tiffany established three traditional pension retirement plans for eligible employees hired before January 1, 2006: the
Pension Plan, the Excess Plan and the Supplemental Plan. Ms. Cloud is eligible to participate in these plans.
Average Final Compensation
Average final compensation is used in each plan to calculate benefits. A participant's "average final compensation" is
the average of the highest five years of compensation received in the last 10 years of creditable service.
