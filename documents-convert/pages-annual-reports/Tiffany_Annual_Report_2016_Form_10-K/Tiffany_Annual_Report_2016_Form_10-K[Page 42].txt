in Australia and one each in Korea and New Zealand), three in Europe (two in Italy and one in the Netherlands) and
one in the Americas (in Canada) while closing three stores in Asia-Pacific (two in China and one in Singapore) and
one each in Japan and Europe (in Germany). In addition, the Company relocated five existing stores.
In 2015, the Company increased gross retail square footage by 4%, net, through store openings, closings and
relocations. The Company opened 16 stores and closed four: opening three in the Americas (in the U.S., Canada and
Chile), 11 in Asia-Pacific (five in China, two in Macau and one each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand) and
two in Europe (in Spain and Switzerland) while closing one store in the Americas and three stores in Asia-Pacific. In
addition, the Company relocated nine existing stores.
Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $2,700 in 2016, $2,900
in 2015 and $3,100 in 2014. The declines in 2016 and 2015 reflected the effects of decreased sales (which in
2015 were negatively affected by currency translation) and growth in retail square footage.

g Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased 1.5 percentage points in 2016 reflecting favorable
i product input costs and the effect of price increases, and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product sales mix.
Gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in 2015 reflecting favorable product input costs that were partly offset
by a shift in sales mix to higher-priced, lower-margin products. In addition, the benefit from retail price increases
was partly offset by the negative effect from the strong US. dollar.
Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost
increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/US. dollar relationships. Its long-term
strategy is to continue that approach, although significant increases in product input costs or weakening foreign
currencies can affect gross margin negatively over the short-term until management makes necessary price
adjustments. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product
category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions.
Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures
(see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note H. Hedging Instruments"). Management
increased retail prices in both 2016 and 2015 across most geographic regions and product categories, some of
which were intended to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations.

SG&A expenses in 2016 (excluding the 2016 and 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $46.6
million, or 3%, largely reflecting increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses and labor and incentive
compensation costs. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation.
