ITEM 3. APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Rule 14a-21(a) ("SEC Rule 14") was adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. It requires the Company to include
in its proxy statement, at least once every three years, a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation
of the Company's named executive officers. Accordingly, we are presenting the following resolution for the vote of the
shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended) in this Proxy Statement,
including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, be and
hereby is APPROVED.
The disclosed compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers (Messrs. Cumenal, Erceg, Nicoletti,
Bellaiche and Galtie, and Ms. Cloud) for which your approval is sought may be found at PS-38 through PS-94 inclusive
of this Proxy Statement.
At the 2016 Annual Meeting, the Company included in its proxy statement a separate shareholder advisory vote to
approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers for the 2015 fiscal year. The Company's Say on
Pay proposal passed with 96.6% of the shareholder advisory votes in favor of the Company's executive compensation
program. The Committee considered shareholder approval of the executive compensation program in evaluating the
design of the program for Fiscal 2017.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN
FISCAL 2016.
