(d) The actuarial valuation shown takes into account the current age of the director and is based on the following
assumptions: RP2014 Male/Female Mortality Table with White Collar Adjustments regressed to base year 2006
and projected generationally from 2006 with Scale MP-2016; discount rate of 4.25%; and assumed retirement
age of 65 (if the director is over age 65, the director is assumed to retire on January 3 1, 2017). These assumptions
are consistent with those used to prepare the Company's financial statements, except for the retirement age
assumption. This column does not include earnings under the Deferral Plan because the Deferral Plan does not
pay above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred. Where an N/A appears, the director
is not eligible for this benefit. The pension benefit for Ms. Bravo and Messrs. Marquis and Shutzer decreased
in value in Fiscal 2016 by $18,007, $19,845 and $18,763, respectively. In addition, this column does not
include changes in pension value or nonqualified deferred compensation earnings for Mr. Kowalski that are
attributable to his employment.

3 for travel, food and lodging.
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of the Board reviews comparisons of the compensation of the
Company's directors to the compensation of directors of peer companies. See "Defining Appropriate Comparators—Peer
Group" at PS—49. For Fiscal 2016, compensation of the Company's directors approximated the peer group median.
Directors first elected prior to January 1, 1999 who retire as non-employee directors with five or more years of Board
service are also entitled to receive an annual retirement benefit equal to $38,000, payable at the later of age 65 or the
retirement date. This benefit is payable quarterly and continues for a period of time equal to the director's length of
service on the Board, including periods served as an employee director, or until death, if earlier. Directors Bravo, Marquis
and Shutzer are the only directors entitled to participate in this benefit plan.
