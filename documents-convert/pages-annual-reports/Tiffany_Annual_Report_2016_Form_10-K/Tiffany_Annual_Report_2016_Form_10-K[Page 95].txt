3 In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value
("NAV") per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The
fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the
Qualified Plan's fair value of plan assets at the end of each respective year.
Valuation Techniques
Investments within the fair value hierarchy. Securities traded on the national securities exchange (certain
government bonds) are valued at the last reported sales price or closing price on the last business day of the fiscal
year. Investments traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sales were reported
(certain government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage obligations) are valued at the last reported bid price.
