RELATIONSHIP WITH INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
As noted under "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance—Committees of the Board—Audit Committee" at PS-25,
the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of
any registered public accounting firm engaged by the Company for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report
or performing other audit, review or attest services for the Company. Further, the Audit Committee ensures the rotation
of the lead audit partner having responsibility for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the audit partner responsible for reviewing such audit, as
required by law, and periodically considers whether, in order to assure continuing auditor independence, there should
be regular rotation of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has selected PwC as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's
consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2018. PwC has, directly or through its predecessor firms, served as the Company's independent registered
public accounting firm continuously since 1984. In selecting PwC to serve in this capacity for the fiscal year ending
January 31, 2018, the Audit Committee considered the independence of PwC, and whether the audit and non-audit
services PwC provides to the Company are compatible with maintaining that independence.
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring advance approval of PwC's fees and services by the Audit Committee;
this policy also prohibits PwC from performing certain non-audit services for the Company including: (i) bookkeeping,
(ii) financial information systems design and implementation, (iii) appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
contribution in kind reports, (iv) actuarial services, (v) internal audit outsourcing services, (vi) management functions
or human resources, (vii) investment advisor or investment banking services, and (viii) legal and expert services unrelated
to the audit. All fees paid to PwC by the Company as shown in the table that follows were approved by the Audit
Committee pursuant to this policy.
