the transfer occurs. This ASU is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period and the amendments should be applied on a
modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning
of the period of adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the consolidated financial
statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates step 2 (which measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the
implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill) from the goodwill
impairment test. Instead, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall
be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting
unit. This ASU should be adopted by the Company for its annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment
tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Management does not believe the adoption of this ASU will
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
