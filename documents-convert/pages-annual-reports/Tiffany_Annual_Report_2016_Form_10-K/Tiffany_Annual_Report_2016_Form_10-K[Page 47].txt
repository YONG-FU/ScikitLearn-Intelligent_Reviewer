multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities
(collectively, the "Credit Facilities"), resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750.0 million. In October 2016, the
maturity for each of the Credit Facilities was extended for one additional year pursuant to the terms set forth in the ‘
respective agreements governing the Credit Facilities. Therefore, the four-year and five-year Credit Facilities will ’

990.0 million ($143.8 million at January 31, 2017). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement, which matures in July

its terms in July 2016, as well as for Tiffany-Shanghai's general working capital requirements. See "Item 8. Financial
