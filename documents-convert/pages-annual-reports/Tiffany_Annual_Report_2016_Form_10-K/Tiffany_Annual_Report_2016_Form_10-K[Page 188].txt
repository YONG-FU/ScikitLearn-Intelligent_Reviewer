LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 162(m) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally denies a federal income tax deduction to the Company
for compensation in excess of $1,000,000 per year paid to any of the NEOs other than the CFO or any officer
who ceases employment prior to the end of the tax year. This denial of deduction is subject to an exception for
"performance-based compensation" such as the PSUs, stock options and annual incentive awards discussed
above. Although the Committee has designed the executive compensation program with tax considerations in
mind, the Committee does not believe that it would be in the best interests of the Company to adopt a policy
that would preclude compensation arrangements subject to deduction limitations.
The compensation actually paid to the executive officers is expected to be deductible by the Company except
in the following respect: compensation that exceeds $1,000,000 in any single year for any single NEO to whom
Section 162(m) applies, consisting of the following elements: "Salary" and "All Other Compensation" in the
Summary Compensation Table at PS-68, plus compensation that relates to the RSUs described in note (0) to
the Summary Compensation Table. The Committee may decide, in the course of exercising its business judgment,
to adjust payouts under one or more other compensation components in a way that disqualifies such payouts as
performance-based for a particular year.
