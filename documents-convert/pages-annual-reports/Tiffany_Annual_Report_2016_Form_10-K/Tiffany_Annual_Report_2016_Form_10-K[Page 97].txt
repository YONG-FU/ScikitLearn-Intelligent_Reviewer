The EPSRS Plan provides a defined contribution retirement benefit ("DCRB") to eligible employees hired on or after
January 1, 2006. Under the DCR B, the Company makes contributions each year to each employee's account at a
rate based upon age and years of service. These contributions are deposited into individual accounts in each
employee's name to be invested in a manner similar to the retirement savings portion of the EPSRS Plan. The
Company recorded expense of $4.6 million, $3.2 million and $4.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company has a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for directors, executives and certain management
employees, whereby eligible participants may defer a portion of their compensation for payment at specified future
dates, upon retirement, death or termination of employment. This plan also provides for an excess defined
contribution retirement benefit ("Excess DC benefit") for certain eligible executives and management employees,
hired on or after January 1, 2006. The Excess DC benefit is credited to the eligible employee's account, based on
the compensation paid to the employee in excess of the IRS limits for contribution under the DCRB Plan. Under the
plan, the deferred compensation is adjusted to reflect performance, whether positive or negative, of selected
investment options chosen by each participant during the deferral period. The amounts accrued under the plans were
$26.5 million and $24.9 million at January 31, 2017 and 2016, and are reflected in other long-term liabilities. The â€˜
Company does not promise or guarantee any rate of return on amounts deferred.
