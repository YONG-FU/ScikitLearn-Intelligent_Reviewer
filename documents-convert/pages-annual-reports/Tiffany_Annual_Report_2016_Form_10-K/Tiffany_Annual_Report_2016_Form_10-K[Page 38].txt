Net Sales — 2016 compared with 2015. In 2016, worldwide net sales decreased $103.1 million, or 3%, reflecting
declines in the Americas and Europe, an increase in Japan and unchanged sales in Asia-Pacific. There was no
significant impact from foreign currency translation on worldwide net sales.
In 2016, jewelry sales represented 92% of worldwide net sales. Changes in jewelry sales by product category relative
to the prior year were as follows:
(in millions) $ Change % Change,
High, fine & solitaire jewelry $ (75.0) (9)%
Engagement jewelry & wedding bands (20.2) (2)
Fashion jewelry (1 1.8) (1)
Designer jewelry 4.2 1
The decrease in sales of high, fine & solitaire jewelry reflected declines across the category, while the engagement
jewelry & wedding bands category decreased due to a shift in sales mix towards wedding bands. The fashion jewelry
category decreased as declines in silver jewelry, although at a smaller rate than in prior year, more than offset
increases in gold jewelry.
Items bearing the name of and attributed to one of the Company's "named" designers: Elsa Peretti and Paloma
Picasso, which were previously reported across the high, fine & solitaire jewelry, engagement jewelry & wedding
bands and fashion jewelry categories, have been reclassified into a designer jewelry category to conform with
management's current internal analysis of product sales. Additionally, certain reclassifications within the jewelry
categories have been made to the prior years' amounts to conform to the current year category presentation.
