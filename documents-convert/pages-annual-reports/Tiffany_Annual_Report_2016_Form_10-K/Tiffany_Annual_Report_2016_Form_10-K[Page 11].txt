(see "PRODUCT SUPPLY CHAIN — Supply of Diamonds" below); and (iii) licensing agreements. Retail sales are
transacted in five Company-operated TIFFANY & C0. stores in the United Arab Emirates.
Licensing Agreements. The Company receives earnings from a licensing agreement with Luxottica Group for the
distribution of TIFFANY & CO. brand eyewear. The earnings received from this licensing agreement represented less
than 1% of worldwide net sales in 2016.
In 2015, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with Coty Inc. regarding the development, production and
distribution of a new line of TIFFANY & CO. brand fragrances. The Company did not receive any earnings from this
agreement in 2015 or 2016, and does not expect any earnings in 2017 to be significant.
Retail Distribution Base
Management regularly evaluates opportunities to optimize its retail store base. This includes evaluating potential
markets for new TIFFANY & C0. stores, as well as the renovation, relocation, or, in certain instances, closure of
existing stores. Considerations include the characteristics of the markets to be served, consumer demand and the
proximity of other luxury brands and existing TIFFANY & C0. locations. Management recognizes that over-saturation ‘
of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a number of
opportunities remaining in new and existing markets that will meet the requirements for a TIFFANY & C0. location in
the future. 3

As part of the Company's strategy, management plans to increase gross retail square footage by approximately 3%,
net through the addition of new stores, relocations, renovations and closings in 2017. For a summary of the
Company's existing retail square footage, see "Item 2. Properties".
E-Commerce
The Company currently operates e-commerce enabled websites in 13 countries as well as informational websites in
several additional countries. Sales transacted on those websites accounted for 6% of worldwide net sales in 2016,
2015 and 2014. The Company invests in ongoing website enhancements and is evaluating opportunities to expand
its e-commerce sites to additional countries. In addition, management believes that these websites serve a role as
marketing tools to attract customers to the Company's stores.
Products
The Company's principal product category is jewelry, which represented 92%, 93% and 92% of worldwide net sales
in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The Company offers an extensive selection of TIFFANY & C0. brand jewelry at a wide
range of prices. Designs are developed by employees, suppliers, independent designers and independent "named"
designers (see "MATERIAL DESIGNER LICENSE" below).
The Company also sells timepieces, leather goods, sterling silver goods (other than jewelry), china, crystal, stationery,
fragrances and accessories, which represented, in total, 7% of worldwide net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The
remaining approximately 1% of worldwide net sales were attributable to wholesale sales of diamonds and earnings
received from a third-party licensing agreement.
