The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent management believes these assets will more likely than
not be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available evidence, including future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and
recent financial operations. In the event management were to determine that the Company would be able to realize
its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an
adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, management records reserves
using a more-liker-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken.
The Company, its US. subsidiaries and the foreign branches of its US. subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal
income tax return.
Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
Basic EPS is computed as net earnings divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and unvested restricted ‘
stock units.
The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the numerators and denominators for the basic and diluted EPS
computations: g

For the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were 1.3 million, 0.8 million and 0.3 million stock
options and restricted stock units excluded from the computations of earnings per diluted share due to their
antidilutive effect.
New Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No.
2014-09 — Revenue From Contracts with Customers, to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and create
common revenue recognition guidance between US. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and
International Financial Reporting Standards. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize
revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need
to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying
performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the
transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-14 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, deferring the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is also permitted as of the original effective date (interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016) and full or modified retrospective application is permitted. Subsequently, the FASB has issued
a number of ASU's amending ASU-2014-09 and providing further guidance related to revenue recognition, which
management is collectively evaluating. The effective date and transition requirements for these amendments are the
same as ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the new
guidance on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has identified an implementation project team and
related oversight processes and has commenced the assessment phase of the project. The Company has not
concluded as to whether the new guidance will be adopted on a full or modified retrospective basis, but will not
apply the early adoption provisions of the new guidance.
