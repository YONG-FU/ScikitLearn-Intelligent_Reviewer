(iii) If the Exercise Price and/or tax withholding obligation for any Option or Award granted under
the Plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to the Company (by either actual delivery or attestation) or
by the Company withholding Shares, the number of Shares issued on such exercise or Award without
offset for the number of Shares so tendered shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining
the maximum number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan; if the Exercise Price and/or
tax withholding obligation for any Option or Award granted under the Plan is satisfied by the Company
withholding Shares, the full number of Shares for which such Option was exercised or such Award
was granted, without reduction for the number of Shares withheld, shall be deemed delivered for
purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for delivery under the Plan.

without limitation non-equity compensation and the grant-date fair value of Options or Stock Awards,
or any combination of Options and Stock Awards) that may be awarded to any one Participant in any
single fiscal year of the Company in connection with his or her service as a member of the Board

chairperson of the Board.

property, or a different number or kind of shares or securities, or if cash, property or Shares or other

more mergers, reorganizations, reclassifications, recapitalizations, stock splits, reverse stock splits,
stock dividends, dividends (other than regular, quarterly dividends), or other distributions, spin-offs
or the like, or if substantially all of the property and assets of the Company are sold, then, unless
the terms of the transaction shall provide otherwise, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the
number and/or type of shares or securities for which Awards may thereafter be granted under the
Plan and for which Awards then outstanding under the Plan may thereafter be exercised. Any such
adjustments in outstanding Awards shall be made without changing the aggregate Exercise Price
applicable to the unexercised portions of outstanding Options. The Committee shall make such
adjustments to preservethe benefits or potential benefits of the Plan and the Awards; such adjustments
may include, but shall not be limited to, adjustment of: (i) the number and kind of shares which may
be delivered under the Plan; (ii) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; (iii) .
the Exercise Price of outstanding Options; (iv) the limit specified in subsection 4.2(b) above; and

Shares under the Plan or make any other distribution of benefits under the Plan unless such delivery
or distribution would comply with all applicable laws (including, without limitation, the requirements .

entity and the Committee may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
as the Committee may deem advisable, including, without limitation, restrictions under applicable
federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such
Shares are then listed and/or traded, and under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to
such Shares. In the event that the Committee determines in its discretion that the registration, listing
or qualification of the Shares issuable under the Plan on any securities exchange or under any
applicable law or governmental regulation is necessary as a condition to the issuance of such Shares
under an Option or Stock Award, such Option or Stock Award shall not be exercisable or exercised
in whole or in part unless such registration, listing and qualification, and any necessary consents or
approvals have been unconditionally obtained.
(b) Distribution of Shares under the Plan may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange.
