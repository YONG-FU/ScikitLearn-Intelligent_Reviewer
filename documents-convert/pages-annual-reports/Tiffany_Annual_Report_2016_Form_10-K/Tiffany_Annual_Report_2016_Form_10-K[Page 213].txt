participating employees who terminate from employment and were determined on the basis of the coverage
elections made by the executive officer.
(f) The value of early vesting of annual stock option grants made in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was determined
using $78.72, the closing value of the Company's common stock on January 31,2017. In the event of a Change
in Control that is not a Terminating Transaction (as defined below), the unvested portion of such options will
vest only upon the executive's involuntary termination from employment. For the purposes of this table, it is
assumed that the Change in Control was a 35% share acquisition and not a Terminating Transaction. This
column also assumes early vesting of the outstanding portions of the stock option grants awarded to Mr. Cumenal
upon his promotion in September 2013 (36,523 outstanding), to Mr. Erceg upon his hire in November 2016
(140,847 outstanding), to Mr. Bellaiche upon his hire in July 2014 (7,000 outstanding) and to Mr. Galtie upon
his hire in September 2015 (14,557 outstanding).
(g) The value of early vesting of annual PSU and RSU grants made in 2014,2015, 2016 and 2017 was determined
using $78.72, the closing value of the Company's common stock on January 31,2017. In the event of a Change
in Control that is not a Terminating Transaction, vesting of these RSUs and PSUs will only occur upon the
executive's involuntary termination from employment. Upon such an involuntary termination, the outstanding
portion of the RSUs will vest in full, while the portion of PSUs to vest will be determined by a schedule based
on the applicable three-year performance period. For the purposes of this table, it is assumed that the Change
in Control was a 35% share acquisition and not a Terminating Transaction. Accordingly, this column assumes
early vesting of 30% of the total number of PSU's granted in 2014; early vesting of 55% of the PSUs granted
in 2015 and 2016; and no early vesting of PSUs granted in 2017. This column also assumes early vesting of
100% of the outstanding portions of the RSU grants awarded to certain executive officers in January 2017, as
well as of the RSUs granted to Mr. Cumenal in September 2013 (12,419), to Mr. Erceg in November 2016
(26,253 outstanding), to Mr. Bellaiche in July 2014 (1,863 outstanding) and to Mr. Galtie in September 2015
(3,453 outstanding).
