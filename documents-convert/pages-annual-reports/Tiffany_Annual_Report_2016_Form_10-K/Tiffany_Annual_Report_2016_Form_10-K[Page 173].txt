BASE SALARY
The Committee pays the executive officers competitive base salaries as one part of a total compensation program
to attract and retain talent, but does not use base salary increases as the primary means of recognizing talent
and performance.
In January 2017, the Committee reviewed base salaries for all executive officers. The Committee increased the
base salaries for all NEOs other than Messrs. Cumenal and Erceg.

competitive market compensation levels for comparable positions; executive experience and skill set; expected
contributions; breadth, scope and complexity of role; internal equity; and overall shareholder support as evidenced
by the 2016 Say on Pay vote.
