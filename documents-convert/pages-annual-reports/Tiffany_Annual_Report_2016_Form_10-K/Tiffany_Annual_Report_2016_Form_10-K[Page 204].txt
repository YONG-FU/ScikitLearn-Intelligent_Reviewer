(c) This January 2014 grant of PS Us vested three business days following the date on which the Company's audited
financial results for Fiscal 2016 were publicly reported.
(d) This value has been computed at 27.46% of maximum based on Company EPS and ROA performance in Fiscal
2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. The resulting value was computed on the basis of the closing stock price

performance goals, will be pro-rated based on his employment during the performance period, and may only be
reduced in the Committee's discretion if the reduction applies to the executive officers generally. See "Chief
Executive Officer Transition—Frederic Cumenal Departure" at PS—39.

$78.72 on January 31, 2017. If the EPS and ROA targets are both met at 100% (again resulting in no ROA
adjustment) for the respective performance period, the value would be computed at 50% of maximum,

shares.
