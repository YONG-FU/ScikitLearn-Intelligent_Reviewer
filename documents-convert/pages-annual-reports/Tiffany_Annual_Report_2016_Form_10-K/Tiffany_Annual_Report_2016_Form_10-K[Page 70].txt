Information Systems Assessment. The Company is engaged in a multi-year program to evaluate and, where
appropriate, upgrade and/or replace certain of its information systems. As part of this program, the Company
identified opportunities to enhance its finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities, and
began development efforts to replace certain of its existing systems and provide these enhanced capabilities. The
Company recently completed an assessment of the replacement system under development to evaluate whether the
continued development of this system would deliver sufficiently improved operating capabilities. Following the
completion of this assessment, in the three months ended January 31, 2017, the Company concluded that the
development of this system should be modified such that the finished goods inventory management and
merchandising capabilities that were intended to be delivered utilizing this new system will instead be delivered
through further development of the Companyâ€™s current Enterprise Resource Planning system and continued
implementation of a new order management system. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the costs capitalized
for the development of the replacement system for impairment in accordance with its policy on the review of long-
lived assets (see "Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"), and determined, based on specific
identification of costs capitalized pertaining to the development of specific capabilities in the new system, that
$25.4 million of such capitalized costs relate to software functionality which will not be utilized, and therefore will
not have future benefit to the Company. As such, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $25.4
million as a component of SG&A expenses in the three months ended January 31, 2017.
