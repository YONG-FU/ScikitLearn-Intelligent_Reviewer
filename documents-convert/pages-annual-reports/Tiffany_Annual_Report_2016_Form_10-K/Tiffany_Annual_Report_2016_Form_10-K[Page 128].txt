This Proxy Statement and accompanying material, including the form of proxy, have been sent to you on behalf of the
Company by order of the Board.
This Proxy Statement was first sent to the Company's shareholders on or about April 7, 2017, in connection with the
2017 Annual Meeting of the shareholders of the Company to be held on Thursday, May 25, 2017, at 9:30 am. at The
Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, New York, New York.
You are entitled to vote at our 2017 Annual Meeting because you were a shareholder, or held Company stock through
a broker, bank or other nominee, at the close of business on March 27, 2017, the record date for this year's Annual
Meeting. That is why you were sent this Proxy Statement and accompanying material.
WHAT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING MATERIAL?
The information included in this Proxy Statement relates to the proposals to be considered and voted on at the 2017
Annual Meeting, the voting process, the compensation of our directors and most highly compensated executive officers,
and other required information. This Proxy Statement is accompanied by our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which
contains financial and other information about our business during Fiscal 2016.
WHY DID I RECEIVE A NOTICE REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING
MATERIAL INSTEAD OF A PAPER COPY OF THE PROXY MATERIALS?
As is the practice of many other companies, the Company is now providing proxy materials by a "notice and access"
process. As a shareholder, you will receive a written notice of proxy, by postal service or e-mail, with instructions on
how to access the proxy materials. This enables the Company to reduce the cost of paper, printing and postage and to
substantially reduce paper use in order to benefit our environment. Those shareholders who wish to receive a paper
report may request one. In some instances, shareholders will receive a proxy card and paper report automatically.
