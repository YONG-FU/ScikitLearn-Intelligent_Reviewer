Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $2.9 billion at January 31,
2017 from $2.8 billion at January 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of the ¥10.0 billion
($88.0 million) Senior Notes due in September 2016 (which had been classified as Current portion of long-term
debt) and the issuance of the ¥10.0 billion Senior Notes due in August 2026 (which is classified as Long-term
debt). See "Financing Activities" below for additional information.
Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2017 were 10% higher than at January 31, 2016 largely
attributable to sales growth in Japan and the timing of collections from department stores. Currency translation had
the effect of increasing accounts receivable, less allowances by 2% from January 31, 2016, primarily from the
strengthening of the Japanese yen. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in 2016
and 21 times in 2015.
Inventories, net at January 31, 2017 were 3% lower than at January 31, 2016, which reflected similar declines in
both finished goods inventories and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. Currency translation did
not have a significant effect on the change in inventories, net.
