Supplemental Plan
These are the key features of the Supplemental Plan:

Company's creditors);
o it is available only to executive officers hired before January 1, 2006;
o it uses a different benefit formula than that used by the Pension Plan and the Excess Plan;
0 benefits are offset by benefits payable under the Pension Plan and the Excess Plan;
0 benefits are offset by benefits payable under Social Security;
0 benefits do not vest until the executive attains age 65 while employed, or age 55 if he or she has provided 10
years of service (benefits will vest earlier on a termination from employment following a change in control - see
"Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control—Explanation of Potential Payments on Termination
following a Change in Control—Definition of a Change in Control" at PS-94);
° benefits are subject to forfeiture if employment is terminated for cause;
0 for those who leave Tiffany prior to age 65, benefits are subject to forfeiture for failure to execute and adhere to
non-competition and confidentiality covenants; and

.0 As its name implies, the Supplemental Plan supplements payments under the Pension Plan, the Excess Plan and from
Social Security so that total benefits equal a variable percentage of the participant's average final compensation.
é Depending upon the participant's years of service, the combined benefit under the Pension Plan, the Excess Plan, the
g Supplemental Plan and from Social Security would be as follows:
Combined Annual Benefit
As a Percentage of
Years of Service Average Final Compensation,
less than 10 (a)
10-14 20%
15-19 35%
20-24 50%
25 or more 60%
(a) The formula for benefits under the Pension and Excess Plans is a function of years of service and covered
compensation (subject to Internal Revenue Code limitations in the case of the Pension Plan) and not any specific
percentage of the participant's average final compensation (see above). A retiree with less than 10 years of service
would not receive any benefit under the Supplemental Plan but could expect to receive a benefit of approximately
13% of average final compensation under the Pension and Excess Plans.
