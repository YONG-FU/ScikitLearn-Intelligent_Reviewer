Precious Metal Collars and Forward Contracts — The Company periodically hedges a portion of its forecasted
purchases of precious metals for use in its internal manufacturing operations in order to manage the effect of
volatility in precious metal prices. The Company may use either a combination of call and put option contracts in
net-zero-cost collar arrangements ("precious metal collars") or forward contracts. For precious metal collars, if the
price of the precious metal at the time of the expiration of the precious metal collar is within the call and put price,
the precious metal collar expires at no cost to the Company. The Company accounts for its precious metal collars
and forward contracts as cash flow hedges. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness based on the total changes in
the precious metal collars' and forward contracts' cash flows. As of January 31, 2017, the maximum term over which
the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions is 24
months. As of January 31, 2017, there were precious metal derivative instruments outstanding for approximately
72,000 ounces of platinum, 1,440,000 ounces of silver and 51,500 ounces of gold.
