of the Company's executive management team have left the Company in recent years, which has required the
Company to focus time and resources on recruiting the new members of its current executive management team.
These changes in the Company's executive management team, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, the
Company's business, and any additional changes to the executive management team could have a negative impact
on the Company's ability to manage and grow its business effectively. In addition, if the Company is not effective in
succession planning, there may be a negative impact on the Company's ability to successfully hire for key executive
management roles, including the Chief Executive Officer position, in a timely manner. Any such disruption or
uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key roles could have a material adverse impact on the
Company's results of operations and the price of the Company's common stock.
(xx) Environmental and climate changes could affect the Company's business.
The Company operates retail stores in more than 20 countries and has both domestic and foreign manufacturing
operations that are susceptible to the risks associated with climate change, including the potential for more frequent
and severe weather events. Such events could result in social, cultural and economic disruptions in these areas,
including the disruption of local infrastructure and transportation systems that could limit the ability of the
’ Company's employees and/or its customers to access the Company's stores or manufacturing locations. Despite the
fact that the Company is pursuing numerous initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint, including its recent
pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, there remains the risk that insufficient global
_n cooperation could lead to heightened levels of climate change. While the Company has a program for reviewing its
6) vulnerability to the impacts of severe weather events and other risks associated with climate change, these events
g could nonetheless negatively affect the Company's business and operations.
