using Level 2 inputs. The fair value of debt with fixed interest rates was determined using the quoted market prices
of debt instruments with similar terms and maturities, which are considered Level 2 inputs. The total carrying value
of short-term borrowings and long-term debt was $1.1 billion and the corresponding fair value was approximately
