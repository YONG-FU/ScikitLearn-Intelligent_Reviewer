Z The expected long-term rate of return on Qualified Plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of
$ return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit
3 obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset
return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan
assets.
For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered
health care was assumed for 2017. This rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at
that level thereafter.
Assumed health-care cost trend rates can affect amounts reported for the Company's postretirement health-care
benefits plan. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant
effect on the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the year ended January 31, 2017 or
aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2016 postretirement expense.
Plan Assets
The Company's investment objectives, related to the Qualified Plan's assets, are the preservation of principal and
balancing the management of interest rate risk associated with the duration of the plan's liabilities with the
achievement of a reasonable rate of return over time. The Qualified Plan's assets are allocated based on an
expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term, but that as the plan's funded
status (assets relative to liabilities) increases, the amount of assets allocated to fixed income securities which match
the interest rate risk profile of the plan's liabilities will increase. The Company's target asset allocations based on its
funded status as of January 31, 2017 is as follows: approximately 50% in equity securities; approximately 35% in
fixed income securities; and approximately 15% in other securities. The Company attempts to mitigate investment
risk by rebalancing asset allocation periodically.
