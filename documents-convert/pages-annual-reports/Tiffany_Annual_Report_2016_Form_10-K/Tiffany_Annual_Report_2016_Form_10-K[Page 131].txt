Shares held in the 401K Plan will be voted by the 401K Plan's trustee in accordance with specific instructions given
by 401K Plan participants to whose accounts such shares have been allocated.
WHAT IS A BROKER NON-VOTE?
Shares held in a broker's name may be voted by the broker, but only in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange. Under those rules, your broker must follow your instructions. If you do not provide instructions to your broker,
your broker may vote your shares based on its own judgment or it may withhold a vote. Whether your broker is permitted
to vote or withhold its vote is determined by the New York Stock Exchange rules and depends on the proposal being
voted upon. With respect to voting on the election of the Board, Say on Pay, the frequency of seeking shareholder
approval of the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers and the Tiffany & Co. 2017 Directors
Equity Compensation Plan, your broker will be required to withhold its vote unless you provide instructions on those
matters.
If your broker withholds its vote, that is called a "broker non-vote." As stated below, broker non-votes are counted as
present for a quorum, but will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors or any of the other proposals
set forth herein. See "WHAT CONSTITUTES A QUORUM?" and "WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH
PROPOSAL?" below.
CAN I CHANGE THE INSTRUCTION TO MY BROKER OR THE 401 K PLAN TRUSTEE?
You may vote in person at the 2017 Annual Meeting, or you may change your instruction to your broker or the 401K
Plan trustee, as applicable, by submitting a subsequent instruction through one of the means set forth above under
"HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES BEFORE THE 2017 ANNUAL MEETING IF I AM A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES
HELD IN STREET NAME?".
HOW WILL MY SHARES BE VOTED IN THE ABSENCE OF INSTRUCTIONS?
