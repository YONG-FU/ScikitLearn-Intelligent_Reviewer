softness across continental Europe was partially offset by sales increases in the U.K. (particularly in the second half
of the year, largely attributable to foreign tourist spending).
The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected decreases across all categories, especially in fashion silver
jewelry. Management attributed the decrease in average price per unit sold to the negative effect of currency
translation, which offset a favorable shift toward higher-priced products within the engagement jewelry & wedding
bands category.
Other. In 2016, total sales decreased $9.0 million, or 8%, partly due to a $16.9 million, or 22%, sales decline in
the Emerging Markets region partly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds.
Net Sales — 2015 compared with 2014. In 2015, worldwide net sales decreased $145.0 million, or 3%, due to
lower sales in all regions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies had the translation effect of
reducing worldwide net sales growth by 5%, with net sales on a constant-exchange—rate basis increasing 2% (due to
growth in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific, while sales in the Americas decreased modestly from the prior year).
’ In 2015, jewelry sales represented 93% of worldwide net sales. Changes in jewelry sales by product category were as

The decrease in the high, fine & solitaire jewelry category reflected lower sales of fine jewelry partly offset by
increased high jewelry sales. The decrease in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category reflected decreases
in both solitaire diamond rings and wedding bands. The decrease in the fashion jewelry category reflected a decline
in sales of entry-level price point jewelry, largely in silver, partly offset by growth in gold jewelry sales. The decrease
in designer jewelry primarily reflected decreases in gold and silver jewelry.
Items bearing the name of and attributed to one of the Company's "named" designers: Elsa Peretti and Paloma
Picasso, which were previously reported across the high, fine & solitaire jewelry, engagement jewelry & wedding
bands and fashion jewelry categories, have been reclassified into the designer jewelry category to conform with
management's current internal analysis of product sales. Additionally, certain reclassifications within the jewelry
categories have been made to the prior years' amounts to conform to the current year category presentation.
