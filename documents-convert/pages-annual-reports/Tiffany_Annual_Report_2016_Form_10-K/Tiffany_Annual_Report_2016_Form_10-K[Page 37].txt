Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow is calculated by
deducting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The ability to generate free cash flow
demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after
deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, ‘
renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in
information technology. Management believes this provides a useful supplemental basis for assessing the Company's
operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free

Comparable Store Sales
Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months.
Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same
geographical market. Sales for a new store are not included in comparable store sales if that store was relocated from
one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of
a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base.
