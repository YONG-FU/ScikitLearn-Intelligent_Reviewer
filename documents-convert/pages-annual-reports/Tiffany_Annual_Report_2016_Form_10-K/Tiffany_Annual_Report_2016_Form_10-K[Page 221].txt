ITEM 4. PREFERENCE, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, ON THE FREQUENCY OF SEEKING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE
COMPENSATION PAID TO THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
SEC Rule 14 requires the Company to ask shareholders, on an advisory basis, how often a Say on Pay vote such as the
one held under Item 3 above should be held. Accordingly, we are presenting the following question for the vote of the
shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting:
Should the Company solicit shareholder approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive
officers each year, every second year or every third year?
Under SEC Rule 14, your advice on this question will be sought at least once every six years. In May 2011, 89.7% of
the shareholder advisory votes supported conducting a Say on Pay vote every year.
Although polling on the frequency of Say on Pay votes is advisory, regulations adopted by the SEC require us to disclose
to you how frequently the Company will conduct Say on Pay votes. We will make that disclosure by filing a Form 8-K
no later than 150 days after the date of the meeting.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE TO SOLICIT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION
PAID TO THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.
