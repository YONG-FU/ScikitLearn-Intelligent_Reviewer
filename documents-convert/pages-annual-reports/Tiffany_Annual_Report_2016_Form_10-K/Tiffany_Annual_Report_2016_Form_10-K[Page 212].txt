POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table shows benefits payable to the NEOs shown upon involuntary termination absent a Change in Control
(defined below), and upon involuntary termination subsequent to a Change in Control. In either case, the values below
assume the N E0 shown was involuntarily terminated on January 3 1, 2017. An "involuntary termination" does not include
a termination for cause, but does include a resignation for good reason.
For information about payments and other benefits provided to Mr. Cumenal upon his actual departure in February
2017, see "Payments and Other Benefits Provided to Mr. Cumenal" below.
No information is shown for Mr. Nicoletti on the following table because his departure in May 2016 was prior to the
date of the assumed involuntary termination.

Q benefits in the event of involuntary termination, without cause, in the absence of a change in control. For a
3 summary of these arrangements, see "0ther Employment Agreements or Severance Plans for Named Executive
Officers—Frederic Cumenal Employment Agreement," and "—Mark J. Erceg 0ffer Letter" at PS-63 and PS-64
and "Discussion of Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards—Philippe Galtie
Compensatory Arrangement" at PS-78.
(b) The terms applicable to the one-time award of time-vesting restricted stock units made to Mr. Cumenal on
September 19, 2013 (12,419), with respect to his promotion to President, provide for acceleration of 100%
of the outstanding shares in the event of an involuntary termination without cause.
(c) Following a Change in Control, the Supplemental Plan will vest upon involuntary termination, or at the time of
the Change in Control if the participant has either attained age 65, or age 55 with 10 years of service. The
value reported reflects the present value at age 55 of the benefit accrued as of January 31, 2017, reduced for
early retirement.

the sum of (i) actual salary and (ii) the target short-term incentive award or bonus, by two. Mr. Cumenal's cash
severance payment is the sum of (i) actual salary multiplied by two, and (ii) $1,318,774, pursuant to the terms
of his employment agreement.
