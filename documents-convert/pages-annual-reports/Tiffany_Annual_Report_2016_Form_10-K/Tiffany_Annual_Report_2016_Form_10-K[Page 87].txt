Stock Repurchase Program
In January 2016, the Registrant's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Company's then-existing share
repurchase program, which was approved in March 2014 and had authorized the Company to repurchase up to
$300.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions (the "2014 Program") in favor of a new
share repurchase program ("2016 Program"). The 2016 Program, which will expire on January 31, 2019, authorizes
the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions, block
trades or privately negotiated transactions. Purchases under the 2014 Program were, and purchases under the
2016 Program have been, executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1
promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the
Company's discretion, subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's
liquidity needs. Approximately $310.4 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program at
January 31, 2017.
The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows:

On February 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.45 per share of

M. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company has two stock compensation plans under which awards may be made: the Employee Incentive Plan
and the Directors Equity Compensation Plan, both of which were approved by the stockholders. No award may be
made under the Employee Incentive Plan after May 22, 2024 or under the Directors Equity Compensation Plan after
May 15, 2018.
Under the Employee Incentive Plan, the maximum number of common shares authorized for issuance was 8.7
million. Awards may be made to employees of the Company or its related companies in the form of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, shares of stock (or rights to receive shares of stock) and cash. Awards made in the form of
non-qualified stock options, tax-qualified incentive stock options or stock appreciation rights have a maximum term
of 10 years from the grant date and may not be granted for an exercise price below fair market value.
The Company has granted time-vesting restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based restricted stock units
("PSUs") and stock options under the Employee Incentive Plan. Stock options and RSUs vest primarily in increments
of 25% per year over four years. PSUs issued to the executive officers vest at the end of a three-year period. Vesting
of all PSUs is contingent on the Company's performance against established objectives established by the
Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The PSUs and RSUs require no payment from the
employee. PSU and RSU payouts will be in shares of Company stock at vesting. Compensation expense is recognized
using the fair market value at the date of grant and recorded ratably over the vesting period. However, PSU
compensation expense may be adjusted over the vesting period based on interim estimates of performance against
the established objectives. Award holders are not entitled to receive dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested
stock options or PSUs or RSUs granted prior to January 2017. PSUs and RSUs granted in January 2017 accrue
dividend equivalents that may only be paid or delivered upon vesting of the underlying stock units.
