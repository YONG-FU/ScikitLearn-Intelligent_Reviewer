Under the Directors Equity Compensation Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock authorized for
issuance was 1.0 million (subject to adjustment); awards may be made to non-employee directors of the Company in
the form of stock options or shares of stock but may not exceed 25 thousand (subject to adjustment) shares per non-
employee director in any fiscal year. Awards of shares (or rights to receive shares) reduce the above authorized
amount by 1.58 shares for every share delivered pursuant to such an award. Awards made in the form of stock
options may have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and may not be granted for an exercise price
below fair market value unless the director has agreed to forego all or a portion of his or her annual cash retainer or
other fees for service as a director in exchange for below-market exercise price options. Director options vest
immediately. Director RSUs vest over a one-year period.
The Company uses newly issued shares to satisfy stock option exercises and the vesting of PSUs and RSUs.
The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using a BIack-Scholes option valuation model and
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The valuation model uses the assumptions noted
in the following table. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's stock. The Company
uses historical data to estimate the expected term of the option that represents the period of time that options
â€™ granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the option
is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date.
