will remain exercisable until February 10, 2018; and
0 Performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Cumenal in January 2015, which otherwise
would have been forfeited upon the termination of his employment, will continue to vest according to
their terms. The payout of this award to Mr. Cumenal —which will remain contingent upon pre-established
performance goals that were not amended in any respect — will be pro-rated to reflect Mr. Cumenal's
employment during the performance period. In addition, the Committee may only exercise its discretion
to reduce the amount of the award to be vested if the reduction applies to the executive officers generally.
Aside from the grants described above and others that vested according to their terms, all of Mr. Cumenal's
unvested equity grants were forfeited upon his departure. The Company will be entitled to recover or revoke the
additional consideration in the event Mr. Cumenal breaches his agreement to provide transition or litigation
assistance or his applicable confidentiality, no-hire and non-solicitation obligations. As required by his
employment agreement, the Company also paid Mr. Cumenal for accrued but unused vacation and an amount
in lieu of the applicable notice period.
The foregoing summary of the separation agreement by and among Mr. Cumenal, Tiffany and the Company is
not complete and is subject to, and is qualified by reference to, the full text of the agreement filed as Exhibit
