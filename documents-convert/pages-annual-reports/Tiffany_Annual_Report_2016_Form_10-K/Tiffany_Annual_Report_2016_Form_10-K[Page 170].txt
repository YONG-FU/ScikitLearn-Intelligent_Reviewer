0 target total direct compensation (target total cash compensation plus target long-term incentive); and
0 target total compensation (target total direct compensation plus all other compensation, above market

DEFINING APPROPRIATE COMPARATORS
Defining an appropriate comparator group within the retail industry is challenging because there are few U.S.-
based companies of similar size in the luxury retail business with an integrated manufacturing function and
extensive global organization similar to the Company. In addition, the Committee believes that an appropriate
comparator group must include non-retail companies because a competitive market for the services of our
executives exists, even among companies outside the retail industry. Accordingly, to fully understand market
compensation levels for comparable executive positions, the analysis includes data for both retail and general
industry companies, with greater emphasis on the former.
For the NEOs, a defined peer group was used for comparative purposes, composed of U.S. public companies
similar to Tiffany, selected by the Committee. For the executive officers as a whole, third-party surveys for both
retail and general industry were used.
