Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
The performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") awarded to executive officers in January 2014 for the
three-year period ended January 31, 2017, vested at 54.92% of target shares (27.46% of maximum shares).
This was based on diluted earnings per share ("EPS") of $1 1.77 for the three-year performance period, compared
to the EPS threshold, target and maximum of $10.18, $14.17 and $16.26, respectively, for the three-year
performance period; and average return on assets ("ROA") of 9.9% forthe three-year performance period, compared
to the RDA target of 11%, resulting in no ROA modifier being applied.
Messrs. Cumenal and Nicoletti and Ms. Cloud were the only NEOs granted PSUs for the three-year period ended
January 31, 2017. Mr. Nicoletti was not eligible for a payout with respect to these PSUs due to his departure
in May 2016. The extent to which goals were achieved resulted in payouts to Mr. Cumenal and Ms. Cloud as

Fiscal 2017 Changes to Executive Incentive Compensation
During Fiscal 2016, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, the Committee reviewed
the Company's senior executive compensation program and adopted several changes to its incentive compensation
design. The changes take into account the executive compensation program objectives of attracting, motivating ‘
and retaining talent; rewarding achievement of short- and long-term financial goals; and linking management
and shareholder interests. The changes also enhance alignment with the Company's strategic goals of driving
total shareholder return through sales growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation.
Annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards granted in January 2017 have the following new features: g
0 New performance metric for annual incentive awards: net sales growth on a constant currency basis. To Q
support the Company's strategy to accelerate sales growth, the Committee added growth in annual net 6)
sales, on a constant-exchange-rate basis that excludes the effect of translating foreign-currency- E
denominated sales into U.S. dollars (see Appendix I at PS-105), as a performance metric for annual
incentive awards (such metric, "Constant Currency Sales Growth"). The Committee believes that Constant
Currency Sales Growth serves as an appropriate measure of the success of product initiatives, as well ‘
as other initiatives to enhance brand positioning and the overall customer experience. Constant Currency
Sales Growth goals will be weighted 20%, while operating earnings and individual factors will be weighted
60% and 20%, respectively. The performance weighting of metrics for the annual incentive awards
granted in January 2017, compared to those for annual incentive awards granted in January 2016, are
shown below.
