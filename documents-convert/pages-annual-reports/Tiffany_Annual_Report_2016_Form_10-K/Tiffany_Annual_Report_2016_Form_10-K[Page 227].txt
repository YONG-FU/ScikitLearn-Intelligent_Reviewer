APPENDIXI
NON-GAAP MEASURES
Net Sales. The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening
foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and
measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that
result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Sales
on a constant-exchange-rate basis are calculated by taking the current year's sales in local currencies and
translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. Management believes this
constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance
and of comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases
(decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year:

Net earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain
items listed below. Management believes excluding such items provides a useful supplemental basis for the .
assessment of the Company's results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. The following tables
