This right can be subsequently sold by the Company or can be recovered should the landlord refuse to allow the
automatic right of renewal to be exercised. Key money is amortized over the estimated useful life, 39 years.
The following table summarizes intangible assets and key money, included in other assets, net, as follows:
7 January 31,2017 January 31,2016 7
Gross Carrying Accumulated Gross Carrying Accumulated

, Amortization of intangible assets and key money for the years ended January 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $3.4
million, $3.7 million and $7.8 million. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $3.4 million in each
of the next five years.
TI Goodwill
Z Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is
i evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
i value of goodwill may be impaired. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine
whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is
concluded that this is the case, a quantitative evaluation, based on discounted cash flows, is performed and requires
management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. If the quantitative
evaluation indicates that goodwill is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated and recognized during that
period. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, goodwill, included in other assets, net, consisted of the following by
segment:
(in millions) Americas Asia-Pacific Japan Europe Other Total 7
January 31,2015 $ 12.3 $ 0.3 $ 1.1 $ 1.1 $ 24.0 $ 38.8

January 31, 2017 $ 12.1 $ 0.3 $ 1.0 $ 1.1 $ 23.9 $ 38.4
The Company recorded no impairment charges related to goodwill in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets (such as property, plant and equipment) other than goodwill for
impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to
events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of long-lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value
of the asset with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the asset is not
recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the
asset and the loss is recognized during that period. In 2016, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of
$25.4 million associated with the costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods
inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment" for
additional information). The Company recorded no significant impairment charges related to long-lived assets in
2015 or 2014.
