clauses resulting from the pass-through of increases in operating costs, property taxes and the effect on costs from
changes in consumer price indices.
Rent-free periods and other incentives granted under certain leases and scheduled rent increases are charged to rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the related terms of such leases, beginning from when the Company takes
possession of the leased facility. Lease expense includes predetermined rent escalations (including escalations based
on the Consumer Price Index or other indices) and is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Adjustments to indices are treated as contingent rent and recorded in the period that such adjustments are
determined.

administrative office facility in New Jersey, in 2005 and for the TIFFANY & CO. stores in Tokyo's Ginza shopping
district and on London's Old Bond Street in 2007. These sale-leaseback arrangements resulted in total deferred
gains of $144.5 million which are being amortized in SG&A expenses over periods that range from 15 to 20 years.
As of January 31, 2017, $45.9 million of these deferred gains remained to be amortized.

Diamond Sourcing Activities
The Company has agreements with various diamond producers to purchase a minimum volume of rough diamonds at
prevailing fair market prices. Under those agreements, management anticipates that it will purchase approximately
$60.0 million of rough diamonds in 2017. Purchases beyond 2017 that are contingent upon mine production at
then-prevailing fair market prices cannot be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company also regularly purchases
rough and polished diamonds from other suppliers, although it has no contractual obligations to do so.
