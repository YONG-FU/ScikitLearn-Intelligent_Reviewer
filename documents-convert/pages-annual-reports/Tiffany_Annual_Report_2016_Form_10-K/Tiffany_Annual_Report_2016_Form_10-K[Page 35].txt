RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Non-GAAP Measures
The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
Internally, management also monitors and measures its performance using certain sales and earnings measures that
include or exclude amounts, or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts,
from the most directly comparable GAAP measure ("non-GAAP financial measures"). The Company presents such
non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with useful supplemental ‘
information that will allow them to evaluate the Company's operating results using the same measures that
management uses to monitor and measure its performance. The Company's management does not, nor does it
suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for,
financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may 3
not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.
or:
Net Sales. The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign
currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales
performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales
made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis are
calculated by taking the current year's sales in local currencies and translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior f ‘
year's foreign exchange rates. Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful
supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance and of comparability between reporting periods. The
following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus
the previous year:
