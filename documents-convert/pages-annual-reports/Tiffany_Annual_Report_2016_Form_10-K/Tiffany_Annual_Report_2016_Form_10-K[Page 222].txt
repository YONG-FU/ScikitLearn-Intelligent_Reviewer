ITEM 5. APPROVAL OF THE TIFFANY & CO. 2017 DIRECTORS EOUITY COMPENSATION PLAN
On March 16, 2017, the Board adopted, subject to stockholder approval at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Tiffany &
Co. 2017 Directors Equity Compensation Plan (the "2017 Directors Plan" orthe "Plan"). If approved, the 2017 Directors
Plan will become effective on the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting immediately following such Annual Meeting (the
"Effective Time") and will replace the 2008 Directors Equity Compensation Plan (the "2008 Directors Plan"), under
which no further awards may be granted after the Effective Time. The Tiffany & Co. 2014 Employee Incentive Plan will
remain in full force and effect.
The Board believes adoption of the Plan will advance the interests of the Company by enabling the Company to attract,
retain and motivate qualified individuals to serve on the Company's Board of Directors and to further link directors'
interests with those of the Company's shareholders through compensation that is based on the Company's common
stock, thereby promoting the long-term financial interests of the Company, includingthe growth in value of the Company's
shareholders' equity and the enhancement of long-term returns to the Company's shareholders.
