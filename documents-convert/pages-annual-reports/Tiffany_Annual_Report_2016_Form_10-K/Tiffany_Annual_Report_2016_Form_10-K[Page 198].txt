applicable restrictive covenants. PSUs granted in January 2014, 2015 and 2016 are forfeited upon involuntary
termination without cause, subject to the Committee's discretion to permit continued vesting.
° PSUs granted in January 2017 accrue dividend equivalent units that will only be paid out upon vesting of the
underlying Units, if any. No dividend equivalent units are paid or accrued on PSUs granted prior to January
2017, and no dividends are paid on any PSUs.
° Vesting of PSUs (for reasons other than those described above or upon a Change in Control) is dependent upon
achievement of one or more threshold performance goals established by the Committee within 90 days of the
start of the performance period.
0 Under no combination of circumstances will vesting occur for more than the number of Units granted (twice the
number of target Units).
For a further description of the PSUs granted in January of 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, including the performance
goals established at the start of each performance period, see "Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Grants—
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units Granted for Fiscal 2017" and "—Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units
Granted for Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014" at PS—56 to PS-57.

In March 2017, for the three-year performance period ending January 31, 2017, it was determined that a cumulative
net EPS of $11.77 per diluted share was achieved, compared to the EPS target of $14.17 and, based on ROA of 9.9%
compared to the RDA target of 11%, no ROA modifier was applied. As a result, vesting of 54.92% of target shares
(27.46% of the maximum shares granted) occurred.
As permitted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan and the 2014 Employee Incentive Plan, the Committee retains
the discretion to adjust achieved performance so that executive officers will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by
certain types of events. For the PSUs granted for the three-year performance period ending January 31, 2017:
o The EPS considered for Fiscal 2014 excluded a charge of approximately $60.9 million related to the redemption
of certain senior notes prior to their scheduled maturities.
° The EPS considered for Fiscal 2015 excluded $29.9 million associated with impairment charges related to a
financing arrangement with Koidu Limited and expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives.
% ° The EPS considered for Fiscal 2016 excluded $24.0 million associated with impairment charges related to
C3 capitalized software development costs and loans to diamond mining companies.
Q EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS — STOCK OPTIONS
>
Stock options typically vest (become exercisable) in four equal annual installments. Vesting of each installment is
contingent on continued employment, except in the event of death, disability, certain events following a change in
control or, in the case of stock options granted in January 2017, retirement or involuntary termination without cause
following at least 10 years of service, provided certain conditions are met. See "Potential Payments on Termination or
Change in Control—Explanation of Potential Payments on Termination following a Change in Control" at PS-93. Special
grants are occasionally made in connection with promotions and new hires and for recognition purposes, and may be
awarded on a cliff-vesting basis. For an explanation of the method of determining the exercise price of options, see
"Long Term Incentive—Stock 0ption Grants" at PS—58.
Stock options expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the grant date. Stock options generally expire earlier on:
0 Termination of employment for cause (immediately upon termination);
0 Voluntary resignation, other than for retirement (three months after termination);
0 Retirement (for stock options granted in January 2017, five years after retirement provided certain circumstances
are met; for prior grants, two years after retirement);
0 Involuntary termination without cause following 10 years of service (for stock options granted in January 2017,
five years after retirement provided certain circumstances are met; for prior grants, three months after retirement);
or
0 Death or disability (two years after the event).
