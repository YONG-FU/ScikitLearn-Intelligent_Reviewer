Credit Facilities
In 2014, Tiffany & Co. entered into a four-year $375.0 million and a five-year $375.0 million multi-bank, multi-
currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities, (collectively, the "New
Credit Facilities") resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750.0 million. The New Credit Facilities replaced the
previously existing $275.0 million three-year unsecured revolving credit facility and $275.0 million five-year
unsecured revolving credit facility, which were terminated and repaid concurrently with Tiffany & Co.'s entry into the
New Credit Facilities. The New Credit Facilities are available for working capital and other corporate purposes.
Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the
Company, (1) LIBOR (or other applicable reference rate) for the relevant currency plus an applicable margin based
upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined under the New Credit Facilities, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to
the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America, N.A.’s prime rate and (iii) one-month
LIBOR plus 1%, plus an applicable margin based upon the Company's leverage ratio as defined under the New
Credit Facilities. The New Credit Facilities also require payment to the lenders of a facility fee on the amount of the
lenders’ commitments under the credit facilities from time to time at rates based upon the Company's leverage ratio
as defined under the New Credit Facilities. Voluntary prepayments of the loans and voluntary reductions of the
unutilized portion of the commitments under the New Credit Facilities are permissible without penalty, subject to
certain conditions pertaining to minimum notice and minimum reduction amounts.
