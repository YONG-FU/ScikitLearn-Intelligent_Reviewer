him in January 2014, had he commenced employment at that time. The unvested portion of this award was forfeited
upon his departure in May 2016.
(e) Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. This column reflects cash short-term incentive awards under the 2005
Employee Incentive Plan or 2014 Employee Incentive Plan. These awards are earned in the fiscal year ended
January 31 and are paid on the basis of achieved performance goals after the release of the Company's financial
statements for the fiscal year. (For a description of the performance goals, see "Discussion of Summary Compensation
Tableand Grants of Plan-Based Awards—Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" at PS-75.) This column includes amounts
deferred at the election of the executive under the Deferral Plan. Amounts so deferred are also shown in the
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.
(f) Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. This column represents the aggregate
change, over the course of the fiscal year, in the actuarial present value of the executive's accumulated benefit
under all defined benefit plans. This column does not include earnings under the Deferral Plan because it does not
pay above-market or preferential earnings on compensation that is deferred.
For each fiscal year reported, the present value of the benefit is affected by a number of factors including
compensation levels, credited years of service, the discount rate used to determine the present value of the benefit,
the executive's age, and the applicable mortality table. For the reported fiscal years, applicable discount rates were
as follows:
I | Discount Rate Applicable to | Discount Rate Applicable to |
Benefits Accrued under Benefits Accrued under
Qualified Pension Plan Nonqualified Pension Plans
lFiscaI 2016 | 4.25%l 4.25%l
lFiscaI 2015 | 4.50%l 4.25%l
lFiscaI 2014 | 3.75%] 3.75%l
In addition to the above changes in applicable discount rates, the 2014 change in pension value also reflects an
update to the applicable mortality tables. These newly applicable tables extended life expectancy, resulting in
increased present values. The applicable mortality tables for the 2014 change in pension value are the RP-2014
Mortality Tables with White Collar Adjustments and generational projections using the Scale MP—2014.
