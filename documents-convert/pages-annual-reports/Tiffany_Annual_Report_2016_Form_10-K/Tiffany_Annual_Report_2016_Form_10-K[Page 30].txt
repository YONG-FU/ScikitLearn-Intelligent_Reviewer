Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In January 2016, the Registrant's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Company's then-existing share
repurchase program, which was approved in March 2014 and had authorized the Company to repurchase up to
$300.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions (the "2014 Program"), in favor of a new share
repurchase program ("2016 Program“). The 2016 Program, which will expire on January 31, 2019, authorizes the
Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions, block trades or
privately negotiated transactions. Purchases under the 2014 Program were, and purchases under the 2016 Program
have been, executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the Company's discretion,
subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs.
Approximately $310.4 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program at January 31, 2017.
