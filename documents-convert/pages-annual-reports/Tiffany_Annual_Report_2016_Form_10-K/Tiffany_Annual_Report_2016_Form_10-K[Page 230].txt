not be decreased after the grant of the Award. An Option may not be surrendered as consideration in
exchange for cash or a new Award (including a new Option with a lower Exercise Price).
2.3 Exercise. Options shall be exercisable in accordance with such terms and conditions and during such
periods as may be established by the Committee provided that no Option shall be exercisable after, and
each Option shall become void no later than, the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of the grant of such

may specify.
(b) If permitted by the Committee, the Exercise Price for Shares purchased upon the exercise of an
Option may be paid in part or in full by tendering Shares (either by actual delivery of shares or
attestation), or the Company may withhold from the Shares to be delivered and/or otherwise issued
Shares sufficient to pay the Exercise Price, in each case with such Shares valued at Fair Market Value
as of the date of exercise. The Committee may refuse to accept payment in Shares if such payment
would result in an accounting charge to the Company.
(c) The Committee may permit a Participant to elect to pay the Exercise Price upon the exercise of an
Option by irrevocably authorizing a third party to sell Shares acquired upon exercise of the Option
(or a sufficient portion of such shares) and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale
