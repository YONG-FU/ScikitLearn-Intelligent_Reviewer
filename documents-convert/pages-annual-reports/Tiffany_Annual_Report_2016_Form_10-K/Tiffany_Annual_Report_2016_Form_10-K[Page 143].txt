BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS
The Company and its Board are committed to maintaining strong corporate governance practices that serve the interests
of the Company and its shareholders. The Board recognizes that the Company's corporate governance practices must
continually evolve, and the Board monitors developments in governance best practices to ensure that the Company
continues to effectively represent the interests of its shareholders. The Board has adopted several corporate governance
practices in support of this commitment, including:
0 Annual election of directors;
0 Majority voting standard for director elections — each director must be elected by a majority of votes cast, not a
plurality;
0 Director resignation policy— each of the nominees for director has tendered a resignation letter to the Nominating/
Corporate Governance Committee to be considered in the event that he or she does not receive a majority of
"for" votes of the votes cast "for" or "against" his or her candidacy. The Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation or
whether other action should be taken;
0 Director independence — 9 of the Company's 1 1 directors up for election are independent;
0 Presiding independent director —the Company's Corporate Governance Principles require a presiding independent
director, tasked with specific responsibilities, to ensure independent oversight whenever the Chairman of the
Board is not independent and to facilitate communication by shareholders and employees with non-management
directors;
0 Director overboarding policy — directors may not serve on a total of more than five public company boards
(including the Board);
0 Resignation on job change or new directorship — a director must submit a letter of resignation to the Nominating/
Corporate Governance Committee on a change in employment and upon accepting a directorship with another
public company (or any other organization that would require a significant time commitment). The Nominating/
Corporate Governance Committee may then accept or decline such resignation;
0 Annual self-evaluation —the Company's independent directors participate in an annual assessment and evaluation ‘
of the workings and efficiency of the Board and each of the committees on which they serve, the results of
which are discussed with the full Board;
0 Long-standing policies governing business and ethical conduct;
0 Commitment to corporate social responsibility; and Q
0 Leading compensation practices — see "Compensation of the CEO and Other Executive Officers—Compensation 5

THE BOARD, IN GENERAL
The Board is currently composed of 12 members. The Board can fill vacancies and newly created directorships, as well
as provide for a greater or lesser number of directors, subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, which limits ‘
the Board's ability to increase in size over 12 members (with certain exceptions, including an increase in the Board's
size to accommodate the appointment to the Board of a new CEO). Effective as of the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting,
the Board intends to take action to establish the number of directors constituting the whole Board at 11.
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, directors may not serve on a total of more than five public
company boards. Service on the Board is included in that total.
