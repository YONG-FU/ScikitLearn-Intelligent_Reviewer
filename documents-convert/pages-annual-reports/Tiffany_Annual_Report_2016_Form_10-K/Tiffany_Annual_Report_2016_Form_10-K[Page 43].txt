SG&A expenses in 2015 (excluding the 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $38.7 million, or
2%, largely reflecting increased marketing expenses and store occupancy and depreciation expenses partly offset by
decreased labor costs (primarily lower variable labor costs for incentive compensation and sales commissions partly
offset by increased costs for U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans). The strengthening of the U.S. dollar
had the effect of decreasing SG&A expense growth by 4%.
The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store
rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) typically represent approximately 15 - 20% of total
SG&A expenses.

offset by higher gross margins.
