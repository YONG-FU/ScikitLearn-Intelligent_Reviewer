purchase the output from mines owned by these companies. At January 31, 2016, there was $43.8 million of
principal outstanding under a financing arrangement (the "Loan") with Koidu Limited (previously Koidu Holdings
S.A.) ("Koidu"), with a carrying amount, net of valuation allowance, of $5.9 million. The Loan, which was entered
into between Koidu and Laurelton Diamonds, Inc. ("Laurelton"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in March
2011, originally provided that repayments of principal would begin in March 2013. However, in March 2013, the
Company agreed to Koidu's request to defer the principal and interest payments due in 2013 to subsequent years
and, in March 2014, the Company agreed to Koidu's request to provide for monthly rather than semi-annual
payments of the principal payments due in 2014. The Company received such scheduled monthly payments from
Koidu in 2014. On April 30, 2015, the Company also agreed to defer Koidu's principal payment due on March 30,
