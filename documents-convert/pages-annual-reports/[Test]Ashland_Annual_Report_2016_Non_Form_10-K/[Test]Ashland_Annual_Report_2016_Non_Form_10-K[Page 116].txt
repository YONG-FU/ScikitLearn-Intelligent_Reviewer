Ashland Financing Activities
Senior notes reﬁnancing, 2015 Senior Credit Agreement and 201 6 Amendment
During June of 20 1 5 , Ashland completed certain refinancing transactions related to the $600 million 3.000% senior notes due
in 2016 (2016 senior notes). Ashland commenced and completed a cash tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its
outstanding 2016 senior notes. At the close of the tender oﬁer, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 senior notes
was tendered by note holders, representing approximately 92% of the outstanding 2016 senior notes, which have been purchased
by Ashland. Subsequently, Ashland redeemed the remaining balance of the 2016 senior notes of $50 million on July 23, 2015.
In connection with the tender offer and redemption, in June 2015, Ashland entered into a new Credit Agreement (the 2015
Senior Credit Agreement). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement replaced the $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility
(the 2013 Senior Credit Facility), and was comprised of a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
amount of $ 1 .2 billion (the 2015 revolving credit facility), which includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit and a $ 100 million
swing line loan sublimit, and a five-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the
2015 term loan facility). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement is not guaranteed, is unsecured and can be prepaid at any time without
premium or penalty.
At Ashland’s option, borrowings under the 2015 revolving credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base
rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The loans’ interest rate ﬂuctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum
and LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus
1.50% per annum), based upon Ashland’s corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015
Senior Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required
to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2015 revolving credit facility through and including June 30,
2015, and thereafter the fee rate will ﬂuctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland’s corporate credit
ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee rate).
