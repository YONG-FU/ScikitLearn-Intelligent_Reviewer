result of the US. dollar strengthening against foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Additionally, pricing declines, primarily due
to raw materials declines, across all reportable segments decreased sales by $166 million, or 3%, while volume and changes in
product mix combined to decrease sales by $19 million, with the primary driver of the decline within Specialty Ingredients’ energy
market.

losses or gains on pension and other postretirement benefit plan remeasurements, and other certain charges incurred as a result of
changes or events within the businesses or restructuring activities.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in cost of sales between fiscal years 2016 and 2015 and between

Cost of sales for 2016 decreased $493 million, or 13%, compared to 2015 primarily due to lower production costs, the net
impact of the acquisition and divestiture of certain divisions and product lines, and favorable foreign currency exchange. These
factors decreased cost of sales by $234 million, or 6%, $83 million, or 2%, and $61 million, or 2%, respectively. Volume and
changes in product mix combined to decrease cost of sales by $11 million.
Pension and other postretirement plans expense decreased cost of sales by $69 million, primarily as a result of decreased
remeasurement losses in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to ﬂuctuations in discount rates (see “Critical Accounting Policies”
for additional details). Key items primarily related to severance and other costs and customer claim adjustments resulted in a $35
million decrease to cost of sales in 2016 compared to 2015.
Cost of sales for 20 15 decreased $791 million, or 17%, compared to 20 14 primarily due to lower production costs, the divestiture
of certain divisions and product lines, and favorable foreign currency exchange, which decreased cost of sales by $279 million, or
6%, $245 million, or 5%, and $181 million, or 4%, respectively. The divestiture of the Elastomers division within the Performance
Materials reportable segment accounted for $202 million, or 82%, of the $245 million divestiture impact on cost of sales. Volume
and change in product mix combined also decreased cost of sales by $30 million.
Pension and other postretirement plans expense decreased cost of sales by $43 million, primarily as a result of decreased
remeasurement losses in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly due to lower than expected return on pension plan assets (see “Critical
Accounting Policies” for additional details). Key items related to severance and other costs, a customer claim adjustment,
accelerated depreciation and asset impairment related to a foreign operation within the Specialty Ingredients reportable segment
decreased cost of sales during 2015 compared to 2014 by $13 million.
