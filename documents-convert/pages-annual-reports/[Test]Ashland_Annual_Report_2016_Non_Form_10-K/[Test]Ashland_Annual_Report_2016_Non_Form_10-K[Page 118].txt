NOTE J — DEBT (continued)
Under the Sale Agreement, each Originator will transfer, on an ongoing basis, certain of its accounts receivable, certain related
assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to CVG. Under the terms of the Transfer and Administration
Agreement, CVG could, from time to time, obtain up to $350 million (in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of
Ashland and its subsidiaries) from the Conduit Investors, the Uncommitted Investors and/or the Committed Investors through the
sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable, related assets and collections. Subsequently during 2014 and 2015, the
available funding for qualifying receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $350 million
to $275 million during 2014 and from $275 million to $250 million during 2015 due to the divestitures that occurred during the
fiscal years. The accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $250 million to $100 million when Valvoline was
removed as an Originator as part of the combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities in September 2016. Ashland accounts
for the securitization facility as secured borrowings, and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as accounts receivable. Fundings under the Transfer and Administration Agreement will be repaid as accounts
receivable are collected, with new fundings being advanced (through daily reinvestments) as new accounts receivable are originated
by the Originators and transferred to CVG, with settlement generally occurring monthly. Ashland continues to classify any
borrowings under this facility as a short-term debt instrument within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once sold to CVG, the
accounts receivable, related assets and rights to collection described above are separate and distinct from each Originator’s own
assets and are not available to its creditors should such Originator become insolvent. Substantially all of CVG’s assets have been
pledged to the Agent in support of its obligations under the Transfer and Administration Agreement.
At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the outstanding amount of accounts receivable transferred by Ashland to CVG was $133
million and $381 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under the facility as of September 30, 2016, while Ashland had
drawn $190 million under the facility as of September 30, 2015. The available borrowing capacity under the facility was $80
million as of September 30, 2016. The weighted-average interest rate for this instrument was 1.5% for 2016 and 1.8% for 2015.
Other debt
At September 30, 2016 and 2015, Ashland held other debt totaling $176 million and $175 million, respectively, comprised
primarily of the 6.60% and 6.50% notes due 2027 and 2029, respectively, assumed in the Hercules acquisition, other short-term
international loans, and a medium-term note.
Covenants related to current Ashland debt agreements
Ashland’s debt contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including
financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary indebtedness, restrictions
on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other customary limitations. As of
September 30, 2016, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.
The maximum consolidated leverage ratios permitted under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement are as follows: 3.75 through
December 31, 2016 and 3.5 from March 31, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter. The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines
the consolidated leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated
EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In general, the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines
Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees
and expenses related to capital market transactions, restructuring and integration charges, noncash stock and equity compensation
expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period; less
any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the
calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page M—8. In general, consolidated indebtedness
includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker ’s acceptances and bank guaranties, deferred purchase price of property
or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees.
The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement during its entire duration
is 3.0. The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted
EBITDA to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period.
At September 30, 2016, Ashland’s calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was 2.7, which is below the maximum
consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement of 3.75. At September 30, 2016, Ashland’s
calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 3.9, which exceeds the minimum required consolidated ratio of 3.0.
