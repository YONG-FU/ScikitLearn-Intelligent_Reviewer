FINANCIAL POSITION
Liquidity
Ashland had $1,188 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016, of which $1,013 million was held by
foreign subsidiaries and had no significant limitations that would prohibit remitting the funds to satisfy corporate obligations.
However, if this amount was repatriated to the United States, additional taxes would likely need to be accrued and paid depending
on the source of the earnings remitted. Ashland currently has no plans to repatriate any amounts for which additional U.S. taxes
would need to be accrued.
Ashland’s cash ﬂows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reﬂected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash
Flows, are summarized as follows.

Ashland paid income taxes of $108 million during 2016 compared to $226 million in 2015 and $88 million in 2014. Cash
receipts for interest income were $6 million in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, while cash payments for interest expense amounted
to $162 million in 2016, $149 million in 2015 and $154 million in 2014. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact
on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 primarily as a result of the strengthening of the U. S. dollar compared to foreign currencies,
primarily the Euro.
