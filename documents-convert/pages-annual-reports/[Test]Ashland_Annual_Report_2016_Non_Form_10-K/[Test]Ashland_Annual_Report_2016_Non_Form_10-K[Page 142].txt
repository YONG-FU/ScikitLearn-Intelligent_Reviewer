NOTE Q — STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS (continued)
Performance shares
Ashland sponsors a long-term incentive plan that awards performance shares/units to certain key employees that are tied to
Ashland’s overall financial performance relative to the financial performance of selected industry peer groups and/or internal
targets. Awards are granted annually, with each award covering a three-year vesting period. Each performance share/unit is
convertible to one share of Ashland Common Stock. These plans are recorded as a component of stockholders” equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Performance measures used to determine the actual number of performance shares issuable upon
vesting include an equal weighting of Ashland’s total shareholder return (TSR) performance and Ashland’s return on investment
(ROI) performance as compared to the internal targets. TSR relative to peers is considered a market condition while R01 is
considered a performance condition under applicable US. GAAP. Nonvested performance shares/units do not entitle employees
to vote the shares or to receive any dividends thereon.
The following table shows the performance shares/units granted for all plans that award Ashland Common Stock.

Fiscal Year 2014 October 1, 2013 - September 30, 2016 110 $ 85.84
(a) At the end of the performance period, the actual number of shares issued can range from zero to 200% of the target shares granted, which is assumed to be
100%.
The fair value of the ROI portion of the performance share awards is equal to the fair market value of Ashland’s Common
Stock on the date of the grant discounted for the dividends forgone during the vesting period of the three-year performance
cycle. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be
satisfied. The fair value of the TSR portion of the performance share awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation
model using key assumptions included in the following table. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period
regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.

through 2013 plan since a portion of each plans payout was in excess of the initial 100% target.
(b) During the December 2014 quarter, Ashland modified certain awards of its performance shares. The awards were modiﬁed to provide that the instruments
be paid in cash instead of stock. This change in payment designation caused Ashland to recognize $7 million in incremental stock-based compensation
expense related to 84 thousand shares modiﬁed during 2015.
