REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Ashland Global Holdings Inc:
In our opinion, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity and cash ﬂows for the year ended September 30,
2014 present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash ﬂows of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. (formerly
known as Ashland Inc.) and its subsidiaries for the year ended September 30, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
ﬁnancial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
