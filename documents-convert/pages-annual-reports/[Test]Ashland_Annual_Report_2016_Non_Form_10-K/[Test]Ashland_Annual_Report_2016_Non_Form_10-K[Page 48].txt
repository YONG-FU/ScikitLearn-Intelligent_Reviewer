Amendment to Ashland 2015 Senior Credit Agreement
During July 2016, Ashland amended the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement to permit the Reorganization and defined the series
of events relating to the separation of Valvoline Inc. Additionally, the amendment provided that if the aggregate principal amount
of the Valvoline debt reached $750 million, Ashland would be required to use the net proceeds of such borrowings to repay its
existing term loan A loan (the 2015 term loan facility) and/or permanently reduce its existing revolving credit commitments under
the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. As a result of the July 2016 amendment and the
Valvoline debt borrowings in connection with the separation, Ashland reduced the revolving borrowing capacity to $800 million
as of September 30, 2016.
In September 2016, following the Valvoline financings described in the Valvoline Credit Agreement section below, the Ashland
2015 term loan facility was repaid in full. The repayment and combined Ashland and Valvoline financing activities during 2016
resulted in Ashland’s recognition of $6 million in previously deferred ﬁnancing costs, which is included in the net interest and
other financing expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.
Subsidiary senior unsecured term loan
During August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provides for an
aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility maturing on February 15, 2017. This term
loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016. At the subsidiary’s option, loans issued under this term loan facility bear interest
at either LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum or an alternate base rate plus 0.75% per annum. The subsidiary may prepay the term loan
facility after three months from the date it was drawn upon without any premium or penalty.
Accounts receivable securitization
Due to activity related to the separation of Valvoline Inc. from Ashland during 2016, the available funding for qualifying
receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility was reduced from $250 million to $ 100 million.
Ashland credit ratings
Standard & Poor’s ratings are BB, while Moody’s Investor Services are Bal. Moody’s Investor Services’ outlook remained
at stable, while Standard & Poor ’5 increased to stable during the fourth quarter of 2016. Subsequent changes to these ratings may
have an effect on Ashland’s borrowing rate or ability to access capital markets in the future.
Valvoline Credit Agreement
The Valvoline Credit Agreement initially provided for an aggregate principal amount of$ 1,325 million in senior secured credit
facilities (Valvoline Credit Facilities), comprised of (i) a five-year $875 million term loan A facility (the 2016 term loan facility)
and (ii) a five-year $450 million revolving credit facility (the 2016 revolving credit facility) (including a $100 million letter of
credit sublimit). The Valvoline Credit Facilities may be prepaid at any time without premium. Amounts prepaid under the 2016
term loan facility may not be reborrowed.
The Valvoline Credit Facilities are guaranteed by Valvoline Inc. ’3 existing and future subsidiaries (other than certain immaterial
subsidiaries, joint ventures, special purpose financing subsidiaries, regulated subsidiaries, foreign subsidiaries and certain other
subsidiaries), and are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all the personal property assets, and certain real
property assets, of Valvoline Inc. and the guarantors, including all or a portion of the equity interests of certain of Valvoline Inc. ’3
domestic subsidiaries and first-tier foreign subsidiaries and, in certain cases, a portion of the equity interests of other foreign
subsidiaries.
At Valvoline Inc. ’s option, the loans issued under the Valvoline Credit Agreement bear interest at either LIB OR or an alternate
base rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. Loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.375% per annum, in the case
of LIBOR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 1.375%, in the alternative, through and including the date of delivery of
a quarterly compliance certificate and thereafter the interest rate will ﬂuctuate between LIB OR plus 1.500% per annum and LIBOR
plus 2.500% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.500% per annum and the alternate base rate plus 1.500% per
annum), based upon Valvoline Inc’s corporate credit ratings or the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (as defined in the
Valvoline Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Valvoline Inc.
is required to pay fees of 0.375% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2016 revolving credit facility through and including
the date of delivery of a compliance certificate, and thereafter the fee rate will ﬂuctuate between 0.200% and 0.500% per annum,
based upon the Valvoline Inc. ’s corporate credit ratings or the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower
applicable rate).
During September 2016, Valvoline Inc. borrowed $875 million of principal on the 2016 term loan facility and $137 million
on the 2016 revolving credit facility. The net proceeds of these borrowings of $865 million (after deducting fees and expenses)
for the 2016 term loan facility and $137 million for the 2016 revolving credit facility were transferred to Ashland. With these
