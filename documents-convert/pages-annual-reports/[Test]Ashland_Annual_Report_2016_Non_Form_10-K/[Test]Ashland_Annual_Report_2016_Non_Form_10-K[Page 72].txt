Ashland Financing Activities
Ashland ﬁnancing activities during 2016
During July 2016, Ashland amended the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement to permit the Reorganization and the series of events
relating to the separation of Valvoline Inc. Additionally, the amendment provided that if the aggregate principal amount of the
Valvoline debt reaches $750 million, Ashland would be required to use the net proceeds of such borrowings to repay its existing
2015 term loan facility and/or permanently reduce its existing revolving credit commitments under the 2015 Senior Credit
Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $1 billion. As a result of the July 2016 amendment and the Valvoline debt borrowings
in connection with the separation, Ashland reduced its revolving borrowing capacity to $800 million as of September 30, 2016.
During August 2016, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of Ashland entered into a credit agreement which provides for an
aggregate principal amount of $150 million in a senior unsecured term loan facility maturing on February 15, 2017. This term
loan was drawn in full as of September 30, 2016. At the subsidiary’s option, loans issued under this term loan facility bear interest
at either LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum or an alternate base rate plus 0.75% per annum. The subsidiary may prepay the term loan
facility after three months from the date it was drawn upon without any premium or penalty.
During 2016, Ashland extended the termination date of the accounts receivable securitization facility from December 31,
2015, the previous termination date extension, to March 22, 2017. Additionally, due to activity related to the separation of Valvoline
Inc. from Ashland during 2016, the available funding for qualifying receivables under the accounts receivable securitization facility
was reduced from $250 million to $100 million. No other changes to the agreement within the current year amendments are
