2016 compared to 2015
Specialty Ingredients’ sales decreased $174 million, or 8%, to $2,089 million in 2016. Energy market sales decreased $55
million compared to prior year primarily due to lower volume as a result of reduced demand by customers, specifically those
within industries negatively impacted by a low oil price environment. The remaining decline in sales of $ 1 19 million was partially
due to pricing declines decreasing sales by $45 million. The divestiture of the industrial biocides assets and the exit from the
redispersible powders product line decreased sales by $24 million and $11 million, respectively. Unfavorable foreign currency
exchange and changes in volume and product mix combined decreased sales by $27 million and $12 million, respectively.
Gross profit during 2016 decreased $26 million compared to 2015. Gross profit included certain key items during the current
and prior years as follows:
° as part of a restructuring plan within an existing manufacturing facility, the current year included a net $1 million
of restructuring income and $4 million of accelerated depreciation, while the prior year included severance and other
costs of $17 million and accelerated depreciation of $6 million; and
- the current year included $5 million of income related to a customer claim adjustment while the prior year included
a $13 million charge related to a customer claim.
Additionally, gross profit within the energy market decreased $17 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of
the unfavorable impact of lower volumes. The remaining gross profit decline of $47 million compared to the prior year was
partially due to planned plant turnarounds, which reduced gross profit by $19 million during the current year, while lower costs,
primarily raw materials, was offset by pricing declines. Volume and changes in product mix combined to decrease gross profit
by $13 million while unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross profit by $1 1 million. The divestiture of the industrial
biocides assets decreased gross profit by $4 million during the current year. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased
1.5 percentage points to 33.9% as compared to 2015.
Selling, general and administrative expense (which includes research and development expenses throughout the reportable
segment discussion and analysis) decreased $24 million, or 5%, during 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily
