The weighted-average rate of compensation increase assumptions were 3.01% for 2016, 3.18% for 2015 and 3.59% for
2014. The compensation increase assumptions for the U.S. plans were 3.00% for 2016, 3.20% for 2015 and 3.75% for 2014. The
rate of the compensation increase assumption for the U.S. plans will remain at 3.00% in determining Ashland’s pension costs for
20 17.
During 2015, Ashland updated the mortality assumption based on information issued by the Society of Actuaries in October
2015 for the U.S. pension and other postretirement health and life plans. Ashland believes the updated mortality table assumption
provides a more accurate assessment of current mortality trends and is a reasonable estimate of future mortality projections.
Ashland’s mortality assumption in 2016 included consideration of updated mortality information consistent with the data issued
by the Society of Actuaries in October 2016.
The weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be 6.66% for 2016, 7.27% for 2015 and
7.67% for 2014. The long-term expected rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans was assumed to be 7.10% for 2016, 7.65% for
2015 and 8.00% for 2014. For 2016, the pension plan assets generated an actual weighted-average return of 12.0%, compared to
1.52% in 2015 and 10.62% in 2014. For 2016, the U.S. pension plan assets generated an actual return of 10.52%, compared to
0.44% in 2015 and 10.33% in 2014. The long-term expected rate of return on assets for the U.S. plans will be 6.60% for
2017. However, the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption, and actual returns will be subject to
considerable year-to-year variances.
The following table discloses the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a
one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years.

U.S. pension legislation and future funding requirements
Ashland’s U.S. qualified pension plans funding requirements through fiscal 2017 are calculated in accordance with the
regulations set forth in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), which provides temporary relief for
employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. Specifically, MAP-21 allows for the use of a 25-year average interest rate within an upper and lower range
for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years, as was
previously required.
Ashland expects to contribute approximately $15 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans and $10 million to its non-
U.S. pension plans during 2017.
Income taxes
Ashland is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment in the
forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining Ashland’s provision
for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable
or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U. S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to
be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss
carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date
occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States
when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences
differs from Ashland’s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of
earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have
a material effect on the Statement of Consolidated Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various
assumptions and judgment by Ashland. If actual results differ from the estimates made by Ashland in establishing or maintaining
