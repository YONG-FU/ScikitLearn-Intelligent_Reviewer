Stock Repurchase Programs
In April 2015, Ashland’s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization (the 2015 stock repurchase
program), which expires on December 31, 2017, and replaced the March 2014 repurchase program. In November 2015, under
this new share repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (2016 ASR
Agreement) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an initial purchase price of $5 00 million
and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock during November 2015.
In February 2016, Goldman, Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 2016 ASR Agreement and the
pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland’s common stock over
the pricing period less a discount, was $99.01 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased by
Ashland that were delivered by Goldman, Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASR Agreement was 5.1 million shares. Ashland received
the additional 1.2 million shares during 2016 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of
shares repurchased. After the 2016 ASR Agreement, $500 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the 2015 stock
repurchase program.
Pension and Other Postretirement Beneﬁt Plans Amendments and Remeasurements
During March 2016, Ashland announced plans to amend the majority of its US. pension plans, with the exception of certain
union plans, to freeze the accrual of pension benefits for participants. The plan changes were effective September 30, 2016.
Additionally, Ashland announced that it will reduce retiree life and medical benefits eﬁective October 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017,
respectively. The net effect of these plan changes resulted in a curtailment of benefits requiring a remeasurement of the benefit
obligation and plan assets. Ashland recognized a loss of $23 million within the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income
during 2016 as a result of the plan remeasurements. The following details the components of the remeasurement impact:
- As a result of the remeasurement of the affected U.S. pension plans, Ashland recognized a curtailment gain of $65
million and actuarial loss of $ 123 million during 2016.
- As a result of the remeasurement of other postretirement benefit plans, Ashland recognized a curtailment gain of $39
million and actuarial loss of $7 million during 2016. This remeasurement reduced the benefit obligations by $86
million, which will be amortized to income in future periods.
- Ashland was also required to remeasure a non-US. pension plan during the March 2016 quarter and as a result
recognized a curtailment gain of $6 million and actuarial loss of $3 million during 2016.
