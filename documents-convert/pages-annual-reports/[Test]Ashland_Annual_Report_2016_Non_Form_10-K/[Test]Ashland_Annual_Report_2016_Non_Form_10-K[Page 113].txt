NOTE G — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (continued)
Other ﬁnancial instruments
At September 30, 2016 and 2015, Ashland’s long-term debt (including current portion and excluding debt issuance cost
discounts) had a carrying value of $3,103 million and $3,431 million, respectively, compared to a fair value of $3,336 million and
$3,484 million, respectively. The fair values of long-term debt are based on quoted market prices or, if market prices are not
available, the present values of the underlying cash ﬂows discounted at Ashland’s incremental borrowing rates, which are deemed
to be Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.

NOTE I — GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Goodwill
Ashland reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when events and circumstances
indicate an impairment may have occurred. This annual assessment is performed as of July 1 and consists of Ashland determining
each reporting unit’s current fair value compared to its current carrying value. Ashland determined that its reporting units for the
allocation of goodwill include the Specialty Ingredients reportable segment, the Composites and Intermediates/ Solvents reporting
units within the Performance Materials reportable segment, and the Core North America, Quick Lubes and International reporting
units within the Valvoline reportable segment.
In the first step of the impairment model, Ashland compares the carrying value of each reporting unit to its respective estimated
fair value. Ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units through the
F -26
