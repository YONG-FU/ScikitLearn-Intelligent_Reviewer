Selling, general and administrative expense for 2016 increased 19% compared to 2015, while expenses as a percent of sales
increased 5.7 percentage points. Key drivers of the ﬂuctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2015
were:
- a $181 million impairment within the Performance Materials reportable segment related to Intermediates/ S olvents;
° $88 million of costs related to the separation of Valvoline and $4 million of restructuring charges related to office
buildings during the current year; and
- a $73 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year due to ﬂuctuations in adjustments from the gains and
losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans (costs of $82 million in 2016 and $155 million in 2015).
Selling, general and administrative expense for 2015 decreased 24% compared to 2014, while expenses as a percent of sales
decreased 3.1 percentage points. Key drivers of the ﬂuctuation in selling, general and administrative expense compared to 2014

- a $146 million decrease in expense compared to the prior year due to ﬂuctuations in adjustments from the gains and
losses for pension and postretirement benefit plans (costs of $155 million in 2015 and $301 million in 2014). As
previously discussed within the cost of sales analysis, the 2015 remeasurement loss was driven primarily by a lower
than expected return on pension plan assets (see “Critical Accounting Policies” for additional details);
- Approximately $100 million of current year cost savings related to the 2014 global restructuring compared to
approximately $40 million of cost savings in the prior year,
° $98 million key item expense during 2014 for severance and other restructuring costs associated with the 2014 global
restructuring;
