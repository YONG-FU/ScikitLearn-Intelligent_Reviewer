Stock repurchase programs
During 2015, Ashland’s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization that will expire on December
31, 2017 (the 2015 stock repurchase program). This authorization allows for common shares to be repurchased in open market
transactions, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or Rule 10b5-1
plans.
During 2014, the Board of Directors of Ashland authorized a $1.35 billion common stock repurchase program (the 2014 stock
repurchase program). Under the program, Ashland’s common shares were repurchased pursuant to accelerated stock repurchase
agreements, a Rule 10b5—1 plan, and a prepaid variable share repurchase agreement. This repurchase program was completed
during 20 15.
The 2014 stock repurchase program authorization replaced Ashland’s previous $600 million share repurchase authorization
(the 2013 stock repurchase program), approved in May 2013, which had $450 million remaining when it was terminated.

November 20 15. In February 20 16, Goldman, Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 20 16 ASRAgreement
and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland’s common stock

by Ashland that were delivered by Goldman, Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASRAgreement was 5. 1 million shares. Ashland received
