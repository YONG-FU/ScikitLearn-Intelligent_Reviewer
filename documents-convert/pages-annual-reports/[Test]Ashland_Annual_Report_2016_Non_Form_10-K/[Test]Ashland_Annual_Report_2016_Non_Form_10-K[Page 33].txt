(1) This figure includes 102 stock options outstanding under the Hercules Incorporated Amended and Restated Long Term
Incentive Compensation Plan. This figure also includes 153,546 net shares that could be issued under stock-settled SARs
under the 2006 Ashland Inc. Incentive Plan (“2006 Incentive Plan”), 255,845 net shares that could be issued under stock-
settled SARs under the Amended and Restated 2011 Ashland Inc. Incentive Plan (“201 1 Incentive Plan”) and 12,198 net shares
that could be issued under stock-settled SARs and 97,950 shares that could be issued under stock-settled restricted stock units
under the Amended and Restated 2015 Ashland Global Holdings Inc. Incentive Plan (“20 1 5 Incentive Plan”), based upon the
closing price of Ashland Common Stock on the NYSE as of September 30, 2016 of $1 15 .95. Additionally, this figure includes
99,021 restricted shares granted under the Amended and Restated Ashland Inc. Incentive Plan (“Amended Plan”) and deferred,
69,914 performance share units for the fiscal 2014-2016 performance period payable in Ashland Common Stock under the
201 1 Incentive Plan, 67,525 performance share units for the fiscal 20 15-2017 performance period payable in Ashland Common
Stock under the 2011 Incentive Plan, and 72,750 performance share units for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period payable
in Ashland Common Stock under the 2015 Incentive Plan, estimated assuming target performance is achieved. Also included
in the ﬁgure are 25,754 shares to be issued under the pre-2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees payable in Ashland
Common Stock upon termination of employment or service with Ashland.
(2) The weighted-average exercise price excludes shares in Ashland Common Stock which may be distributed under the deferred
compensation plans and the deferred restricted stock, and performance share units and restricted stock units which may be
distributed under the 2011 Incentive Plan and 2015 Incentive Plan, as described in footnotes (1) and (4) in this table.
(3) This figure includes 1,336,956 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Incentive Plan, 108,985 shares available for
issuance under the pre—2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees and 248,570 shares available for issuance under the
pre-2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Under the 2015 Incentive Plan, full-value awards, which
include all awards other than stock options and SARs, reduce the share reserve on a 2.75 -to-1 basis. This figure also includes
5,604 shares available for issuance under the 2006 Incentive Plan and 1,365,644 shares available for issuance under the 2011
Incentive Plan; however, both of these plans are closed for new issuances and the only shares remaining to be issued are shares
paid in lieu of dividends.
(4) This figure includes 25,5 14 shares to be issued under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees (2005), which is described
in the “Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation-Ashland Employees’ Deferral Plan” section of Ashland’s proxy statement, and
179,203 shares to be issued under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (2005), which is described
in the “Compensation of Directors—Annual Retainer” and “Compensation of Directors—Restricted Shares/Units” sections of
Ashland’s proxy statement, payable in Ashland Common Stock upon termination of employment or service with Ashland.
Because these plans are not equity compensation plans as defined by the rules of the NYSE, neither plan required approval
by Ashland’s stockholders.
