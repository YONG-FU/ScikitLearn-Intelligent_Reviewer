KEY DEVELOPMENTS
During 2016, the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on Ashland’s current and future
cash ﬂows, results of operations and financial position.
Business results
Ashland’s overall financial performance decreased by 4% during 2016 compared to 2015 as Adjusted EBITDA results
decreased to $1,074 million (see US. GAAP reconciliation on page M-8). The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily
attributable to declines in the Specialty Ingredients and Performance Materials reportable segments, partially offset by improved
Adjusted EBITDA within the Valvoline reportable segment. Compared to 2015, Valvoline’s Adjusted EBITDA results increased
$30 million, or 7%, primarily due to improvements in volume, product mix, and lower raw material costs, specifically relating to
the price of base oil, which resulted in increased gross profit. Specialty Ingredients’ Adjusted EBITDA results decreased $51
