Obligations and funded status
Actuarial valuations are performed for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans to determine Ashland’s obligation
for each plan. In accordance with U. S. GAAP, Ashland recognizes the unfunded status of the plans as a liability in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Summaries of the change in benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status of the plans, amounts recognized in
the balance sheet, and assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations for 2016 and 2015 are as follows.
