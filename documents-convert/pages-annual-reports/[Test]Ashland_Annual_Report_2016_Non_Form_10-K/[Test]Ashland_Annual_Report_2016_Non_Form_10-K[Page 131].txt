Investments and Strategy
In developing an investment strategy for its defined benefit plans, Ashland has considered the following factors: the nature
of the plans’ liabilities, the allocation of liabilities between active, deferred and retired members, the funded status of the plans,
the applicable investment horizon, the respective size of the plans and historical and expected capital market returns. Ashland’s
U.S. pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks
and Ashland’s established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things,
their investment process, historical investment results, frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under
management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and
diversification of investments and to optimize returns.
The current target asset allocation for the US. plan is 51% fixed securities and 49% equity securities. Fixed income securities
primarily include long duration high grade corporate debt obligations. Risk assets include both traditional equity as well as a mix
of non-traditional assets such as hedge funds and private equity. Investment managers may employ a limited use of derivatives
to gain efficient exposure to markets.
Ashland’s investment strategy and management practices relative to plan assets of non-US. plans generally are consistent
with those for US. plans, except in those countries where investment of plan assets is dictated by applicable regulations. The
weighted-average asset allocations for Ashland’s U. S. and non-U.S. plans at September 30, 2016 and 2015 by asset category follow.

US. pension legislation and future funding requirements
Ashland’s U.S. qualified pension plans funding requirements through fiscal 2017 are calculated in accordance with the
regulations set forth in the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21St Century Act (MAP-21), which provides temporary relief for
employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the Employee Retirement Income
