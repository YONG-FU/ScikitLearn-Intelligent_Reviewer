The Valvoline Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA
to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under
the Valvoline Credit Agreement during its entire duration is 3.0.
At September 30, 2016, Valvoline’s calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was 1.4, which is below the maximum
consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the Valvoline Credit Agreement of 4.5. At September 30, 2016, Valvoline’s calculation
of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 13.3, which exceeds the minimum required consolidated ratio of 3.0. Any change
in Covenant Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million would have an approximate 0.3x effect on the consolidated leverage ratio and a
2.9x effect on the consolidated interest coverage ratio. Any change in consolidated indebtedness of $100 million would affect the
consolidated leverage ratio by approximately 0.2x.
Ashland cash projection
Ashland projects that cash ﬂow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving
credit should be sufficient to meet investing and ﬁnancing requirements to enable Ashland to comply with the covenants and other
terms of its financing obligations. These projections are based on various assumptions that include, but are not limited
to: operational results, working capital cash generation, capital expenditures, pension funding requirements and tax payment and
receipts.
Total Equity
Total equity increased $128 million since September 30, 2015 to $3,165 million at September 30, 2016. This increase was
primarily due to $712 million of net proceeds from the IPO of Valvoline Inc., $24 million in common shares issued under stock
incentive and other plans, $17 million of an unrealized gain on available-for—sale securities, $14 million related to pension and
other postretirement obligations, and $1 million of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest in Valvoline Inc. as of
September 30, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $500 million related to stock repurchase agreements,
cash dividends of $97 million, a net loss attributable to Ashland during the period of $29 million, and deferred translation losses
of $14 million.
At September 30, 2016, total equity also includes an amount for noncontrolling interest, which reﬂects the outside stockholders’
interest in Valvoline Inc. At September 30, 2016, Ashland maintains an approximately 83% ownership interest in Valvoline Inc.,
with the remaining approximately 17% ownership of Valvoline Inc. is held by outside stockholders.
Stock repurchase programs
During 2015, Ashland’s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion share repurchase authorization that will expire on December
31, 2017 (the 2015 stock repurchase program). This authorization allows for common shares to be repurchased in open market
transactions, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to one or more accelerated stock repurchase programs or Rule 10b5-1
plans.
During 2014, the Board of Directors of Ashland authorized a $1.35 billion common stock repurchase program (the 2014 stock
repurchase program). Under the program, Ashland’s common shares were repurchased pursuant to accelerated stock repurchase
agreements, a Rule 10b5—1 plan, and a prepaid variable share repurchase agreement. This repurchase program was completed
during 2015.
The 2014 stock repurchase program authorization replaced Ashland’s previous $600 million share repurchase authorization
(the 2013 stock repurchase program), approved in May 2013, which had $450 million remaining when it was terminated.
2015 stock repurchase program agreement
In November 2015, under the 2015 stock repurchase program, Ashland announced that it entered into an accelerated share
repurchase agreement (2016 ASR Agreement) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. Under the 2016 ASR Agreement, Ashland paid an
initial purchase price of $500 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock during
November 2015. In February 20 16, Goldman, Sachs & Co. exercised their early termination option under the 2016 ASRAgreement
and the pricing period was closed. The settlement price, which represents the weighted average price of Ashland’s common stock
over the pricing period less a discount, was $99.01 per share. Based on this settlement price, the final number of shares repurchased
by Ashland that were delivered by Goldman, Sachs & Co. under the 2016 ASRAgreement was 5. 1 million shares. Ashland received
the additional 1.2 million shares during 2016 to settle the difference between the initial share delivery and the total number of
shares repurchased. After the 2016 ASR Agreement, $500 million of share repurchase authorization remains under the 2015 stock
repurchase program.
2014 stock repurchase program agreements
During 2014, Ashland announced that it had entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (2014 ASR Agreements)
with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (Deutsche Bank), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA. (J PMorgan) to repurchase an aggregate
