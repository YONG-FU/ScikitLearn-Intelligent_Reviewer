NOTE R — REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION (continued)
interest in Valvoline Inc. as of September 30, 2016. See Note B for additional information. The ﬁnancial information within this
footnote is reﬂective of the manner in which Ashland manages the Valvoline reportable segment and the Valvoline reportable
segment does not include any assets or liabilities transferred to Valvoline Inc. by Ashland in September 2016. Valvoline’s financial
position and results of operations as reported as a segment of Ashland may be different than how they are reported on a stand-
alone basis.
Unallocated and other generally includes items such as components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses
(excluding service costs, which are allocated to the reportable segments), certain significant company-wide restructuring activities,
including internal separation costs, and legacy costs or adjustments that relate to divested businesses that are no longer operated
by Ashland.

Reportable segment results
The following tables present various financial information for each reportable segment for the years ended September 30,
2016, 2015 and 2014 and as of September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Results of Ashland’s reportable segments are presented based
on its management structure and internal accounting practices. The structure and practices are specific to Ashland; therefore, the
financial results of Ashland’s reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable
companies. Ashland allocates all costs to its reportable segments except for certain significant company-wide restructuring
activities, such as the restructuring plans described in Note F, and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that
Ashland no longer operates. The service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is allocated to each
reportable segment on a ratable basis; while the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits costs are
recorded to Unallocated and other. Ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to
time as internal accounting practices are improved, more refined information becomes available and the industry or market
changes. Revisions to Ashland’s methodologies that are deemed insignificant are applied on a prospective basis.
Ashland determined that disclosing sales by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive
portfolio of products offered to customers and since no one product or a small group of products could be aggregated together to
represent a majority of revenue within a reportable segment. As such, the following table provides a summary of 2016 sales by
product category for each reportable segment:
7 Sales by product category for 2016 7
Specialty Ingredients 7 7 Performance Materials 7 7 Valvoline
7 Cellulosics 38%, 7 Composites 72% 7 Lubricants (a) 89%

The following table presents various financial information for each reportable segment. The operating results of divested
