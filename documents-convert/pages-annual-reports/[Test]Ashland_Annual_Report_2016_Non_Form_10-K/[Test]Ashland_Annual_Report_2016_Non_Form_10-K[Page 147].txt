Ashland Global Holdings Inc. was incorporated on May 6, 2016 as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Ashland Inc. (now
Ashland LLC) to reincorporate in Delaware and to help facilitate the separation of the Valvoline business from the specialty
chemical businesses. As a result of the Reorganization, Ashland Global Holdings Inc. replaced Ashland Inc. as the publicly held
corporation, and Ashland Inc. was converted to a Kentucky limited liability company and is now an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Ashland Global Holdings Inc. Ashland Global Holdings Inc. fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Senior Notes
and has no significant independent assets or operations. For periods prior to September 30, 2016, the parent entity was Ashland
LLC (formerly Ashland Inc.).
Ashland presents all investments in subsidiaries in the supplemental guarantor information using the equity method of
accounting. Therefore, the net income (loss) of the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method is in their parents’ investment
accounts. For each financial statement period presented within the following tables, Ashland Global Holdings Inc’s activity
reﬂects the accounting for investments in subsidiaries under the equity method reﬂective of the 2016 Reorganization and resulting
presentation. The elimination entries within the tables primarily eliminate investments in subsidiaries and inter-company balances
and transactions. The total net effect of the settlement of these inter-company transactions is reﬂected in the Condensed Statements
of Cash Flows as a financing activity. The following supplemental condensed consolidating financial statements present information
about Ashland Global Holdings Inc., Ashland LLC and other non-guarantor subsidiaries.
