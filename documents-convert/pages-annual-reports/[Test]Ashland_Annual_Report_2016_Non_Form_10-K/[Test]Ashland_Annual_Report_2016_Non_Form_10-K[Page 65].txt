2016 compared to 2015
Valvoline’s sales decreased $38 million, or 2%, to $1,929 million in 2016. Lower product pricing decreased sales by $94
million, or 5%, while higher volume levels increased sales by $68 million, or 3%, as lubricant gallons sold increased to 174.5
million. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased sales by $31 million, or 2%, while changes in product mix increased
sales by $29 million. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange was primarily due to the US. dollar strengthening compared to
various foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, Yuan and Australian dollar. The divestiture of Valvoline car care product assets
decreased sales by $45 million, or 2%, while the acquisition of Oil Can Henry’s increased sales by $35 million, or 2%.
Gross proﬁt increased $48 million during 2016 compared to 2015. Changes in volume and product mix combined to increase
gross profit by $32 million, and lower raw material costs, partially offset by lower selling pricing, increased gross profit by $20
million. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross profit by $8 million, while the acquisition of Oil Can Henry’s,
partially offset by the divestiture of Valvoline car care product assets, increased gross profit by $4 million. In total, gross proﬁt
margin during 2016 increased 3.2 percentage points to 38.8%.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $16 million, or 5%, during 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due
to digital infrastructure consulting costs and employee costs of $5 million each, increased advertising and promotion costs of $4
million, and increased research and development costs of $2 million. Equity and other income (loss) increased $12 million primarily
due to the $14 million impairment of the Venezuelan joint venture equity investment in the prior year.
Operating income totaled $403 million in 2016 as compared to $359 million in 2015. EBITDA increased $44 million to $441
million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million to $441 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 2.0
percentage points to 22.9% in 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
Valvoline’s sales decreased $74 million, or 4%, to $1,967 million in 2015. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower
product pricing decreased sales by $70 million, or 3%, and $53 million, or 3%, respectively. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange
was due to the US. dollar strengthening compared to various foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and Australian dollar. Higher
volume levels and changes in product mix increased sales by $55 million, or 3%, and $10 million, respectively. The divestiture
of Valvoline car care product assets on June 30, 2015 decreased sales by $16 million compared to 2014.
Gross profit increased $5 1 million during 2015 compared to 2014. Lower raw material costs, partially offset by lower product
pricing, increased gross profit by $52 million. Changes in volume and product mix combined to increase gross profit by $20
million, while unfavorable foreign currency exchange decreased gross proﬁt by $18 million. The divestiture of Valvoline car care
product assets also decreased gross profit by $3 million. In total, gross proﬁt margin during 2015 increased 3.8 percentage points
to 35.6%.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $7 million, or 2%, during 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily as a
result of $20 million of cost savings from the 2014 global restructuring as well as declines from favorable foreign currency exchange
of $9 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased employee and allocated resource costs of $9 million, as well as
legal and technology expenses of $5 million and advertising costs of $5 million.
Equity and other income decreased by $22 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an $8 million favorable
arbitration ruling on a commercial contract in 2014 and the $14 million impairment of a joint venture equity investment within
Venezuela in 2015. For additional information see Note B in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating income totaled $35 9 million in 2015 as compared to $323 million in 2014. EBITDA increased $37 million to $397
million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA increased $51 million to $411 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 3.3
percentage points to 20.9% in 2015.
EB] T DA and Adjusted EBI T DA reconciliation
The following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance
the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for
the results of Valvoline. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland’s operations,
which exclude certain key items. The $14 million adjustment in 2015 related to the impairment of a joint venture equity investment
within Venezuela. There were no unusual or key items that affected comparability for Adjusted EBITDA during 2016 and 2014.
