NOTE F — RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Ashland periodically implements company-wide restructuring programs related to acquisitions, divestitures and other cost
reduction programs in order to enhance profitability through streamlined operations and an improved overall cost structure for
each business.
Severance costs
During 2014, Ashland announced a global restructuring program to streamline the resources used across the organization. As
part of this global restructuring program, Ashland executed a voluntary severance offer (VSO) to certain U.S. employees and an
involuntary program for certain employees. Substantially all payments related to the VSO and involuntary programs were paid
by the end of fiscal year 2015. The VSO and involuntary programs resulted in expense of $95 million being recognized during
2014, with $13 million being recorded within the cost of sales caption and $82 million being recorded within the selling, general
and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. In addition, the employee reductions
resulted in a pension curtailment being recorded during 2014. See Note N for further information. As of September 30, 2015, the
remaining restructuring reserve for the global restructuring program was $7 million and was fully paid during 2016. Additional
restructuring reserves of $1 million for other previously announced programs also remained as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.
F acilz'ly costs
In prior years, Ashland incurred lease abandonment charges related to its exit from oﬁice facilities obtained as part of the
Hercules acquisition. During 2014, Ashland incurred an additional $4 million lease abandonment charge related to its exit from
a Hercules related office facility. As of September 30, 2015, the remaining restructuring reserve for all qualifying facility costs
totaled $3 million. During 2016, all remaining lease payments were made, reducing the reserve to zero as of September 30, 2016.
The following table details at September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the amount of restructuring reserves related to the programs
discussed above, and the related activity in these reserves during 2016, 2015 and 2014. The severance reserves are included in
accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. As of September 30, 2015,
facility cost reserves were included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while these reserves
were primarily within other noncurrent liabilities as of September 30, 2014.
