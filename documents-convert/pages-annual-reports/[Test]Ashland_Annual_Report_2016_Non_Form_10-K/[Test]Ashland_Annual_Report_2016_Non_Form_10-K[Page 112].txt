Net investment hedges
Since 2014, Ashland has entered into foreign currency contracts in order to manage the foreign currency exposure of the net
investment in certain foreign operations. These foreign currency contracts were primarily the result of certain proceeds from the
sale of Water Technologies being received in non-US. denominated currencies during 2014 and ongoing management of the
volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Ashland designated the foreign currency contracts as hedges of net investments in
its foreign subsidiaries. As a result, Ashland records these hedges at fair value using forward rates, with the eﬁective portion of
the gain or loss reported as a component of the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI and subsequently recognized in
the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income when the hedged item aﬁects net income. During 2016 and 2015, these
foreign currency contracts were settled and Ashland entered into new foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of net
investments in foreign subsidiaries. These settlements resulted in net gains recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment
within AOCI of $4 million and $11 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the total notional value of foreign currency contracts equaled $94 million and $175
million, respectively. The fair value of Ashland’s net investment hedge assets and liabilities are calculated using forward rates.
Accordingly, these instruments are deemed to be Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Counterparties to these
net investment hedges are highly rated financial institutions which Ashland believes carry only a nominal risk of nonperformance.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the outstanding net investment hedge instruments as of September 30, 2016 and
