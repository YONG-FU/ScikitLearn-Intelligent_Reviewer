the technology was commercialized during this period. As a result, as of September 30, 2016, the indefinite-lived intangible assets
consisted only of certain trademarks and trade names of $301 million.
Ashland annually reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment or whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In conjunction with the July 1, 2016 annual assessment of
indefinite-lived intangible assets, Ashland’s models did not indicate any additional impairment for indefinite-lived intangible
assets. Intangible assets were comprised of the following as of September 30, 2016 and 2015.

accelerated amortization, or other events.
