Ashland ﬁnancing activities during 2015
During June of 2015, Ashland completed certain refinancing transactions related to the $600 million 3.000% senior notes due
in 2016 (2016 senior notes). Ashland commenced and completed a cash tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of its
outstanding 2016 senior notes. At the close of the tender oﬁer, $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 senior notes
was tendered by note holders, representing approximately 92% of the outstanding 2016 senior notes, which have been purchased
by Ashland. Subsequently, Ashland redeemed the remaining balance of the 2016 senior notes of $50 million on July 23, 2015.
In connection with the tender offer and redemption, in June 2015, Ashland entered into the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement.
The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement replaced the $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2013 Senior Credit
Facility), and was comprised of a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate amount of $ 1 .2 billion
(the 2015 revolving credit facility), which includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit and a $100 million swing line loan
sublimit, and a five-year senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion (the 2015 term loan
facility). The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement is not guaranteed, is unsecured and can be prepaid at any time without premium or
penalty.
At Ashland’s option, borrowings under the 2015 revolving credit facility bear interest at either LIBOR or an alternate base
rate, in each case plus the applicable interest rate margin. The loans’ interest rate ﬂuctuate between LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum
and LIBOR plus 2.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 0.375% per annum and the alternate base rate plus
1.50% per annum), based upon Ashland’s corporate credit ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (as defined in the 2015
Senior Credit Agreement) (whichever yields a lower applicable interest rate margin) at such time. In addition, Ashland was required
to pay fees of 0.25% per annum on the daily unused amount of the 2015 revolving credit facility through and including June 30,
2015, and thereafter the fee rate will ﬂuctuate between 0.175% and 0.40% per annum, based upon Ashland’s corporate credit
ratings or the consolidated gross leverage ratio (whichever yields a lower fee rate).
During 2015, the potential funding for qualified receivables was reduced from $275 million to $25 0 million. Under the terms
of the Transfer and Administration Agreement, CVG Capital III LLC, a wholly-owned “bankruptcy remote” special purpose
subsidiary of the Originators (CVG) may, from time to time, obtain up to $250 million (in the form of cash or letters of credit for
the benefit of Ashland and its subsidiaries) from the Conduit Investors, the Uncommitted Investors and/ or the Committed Investors
through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable, related assets and collections. Additionally, during 2015,
the termination of the commitments under the Transfer and Administration Agreement under the accounts receivable securitization
was extended from August 28, 2015 to December 31, 2015. See Note I of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information on this agreement.
Ashland debt covenant restrictions
The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement contains usual and customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative
covenants, including financial covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios, limitations on liens, additional subsidiary
indebtedness, restrictions on subsidiary distributions, investments, mergers, sale of assets and restricted payments and other
customary limitations. As of September 30, 2016, Ashland was in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions.
The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines the consolidated leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to consolidated EBITDA (Covenant Adjusted EBITDA) for any measurement period. In
general, the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus consolidated interest charges,
taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, fees and expenses related to capital market transactions, restructuring and integration
charges, noncash stock and equity compensation expense, and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a
cash item in such period or any future period; less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income. The computation of
Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from the calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which have been reconciled on page
M-8. In general, consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness, banker’s acceptances and bank
guaranties, deferred purchase price of property or services, attributable indebtedness and guarantees. The maximum consolidated
leverage ratios permitted under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement are as follows: 3.75 from June 30, 2015 through December 31,
2016 and 3.5 from March 31, 2017 and each fiscal quarter thereafter.
The 2015 Senior Credit Agreement defines the consolidated interest coverage ratio as the ratio of Covenant Adj usted EBITDA
to consolidated interest charges for any measurement period. The minimum required consolidated interest coverage ratio under
the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement during its entire duration is 3.0.
At September 30, 2016, Ashland’s calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio was 2.7 compared to the maximum
consolidated leverage ratio permitted under the 2015 Senior Credit Agreement of 3.75. At September 30, 2016, Ashland’s
calculation of the consolidated interest coverage ratio was 3.9 compared to the minimum required ratio of 3.0. Any change in
