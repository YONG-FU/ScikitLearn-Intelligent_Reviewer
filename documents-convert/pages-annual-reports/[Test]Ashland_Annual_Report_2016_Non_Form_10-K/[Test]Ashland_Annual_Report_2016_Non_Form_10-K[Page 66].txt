(a) Amounts exclude service costs of $28 million, $27 million and $30 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are allocated to Ashland’s
reportable segments.
Unallocated and other recorded expense of $195 million, $227 million and $537 million for 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively. Unallocated and other includes pension and other postretirement net periodic costs and income within continuing
operations that have not been allocated to reportable segments. These costs include interest cost, expected return on assets and
amortization of prior service credit as these items are considered financing activities managed at the corporate level, as opposed
to service costs which are allocated to reportable segments. The recurring pension and other postretirement components in
Unallocated and other resulted in income of $82 million in 2016 and $54 million during each of 20 1 5 and 2014. Unallocated and
other also includes gains and losses on pension and other postretirement plan remeasurements which resulted in losses of $124
million, $255 million and $438 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Fluctuations in these amounts from year to year
result primarily from changes in the discount rate but are also partially affected by differences between the expected and actual
return on plan assets during each year as well as other changes in other actuarial assumptions such as changes in demographic
data or mortality assumptions. For additional information regarding the actual remeasurement for certain key assumptions for
each year, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies - Employee benefit obligations and Note N
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unallocated and other restructuring activities during 2016 included $88 million of costs incurred related to the Valvoline
separation. Restructuring expense also included $6 million, $8 million, and $98 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively,
primarily related to severance and other restructuring charges. Restructuring expense in 2015 and 2014 was associated with the
2014 global restructuring program. Restructuring activities in 2014 included certain indirect corporate costs of $31 million in
20 14 that were previously allocated to the Water Technologies business. Additionally, unallocated and other includes environmental
charges related to previously divested businesses of $36 million, $29 million and $28 million during 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively.
The current year also included $15 million for a legal reserve and $11 million of income related to a legacy benefit for former
directors. Unallocated and other in 2015 also included $16 million of tax indemnity income.
