(b) For 2014, the United States and Foreign amounts for income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes have been revised to reﬂect a change in
the classiﬁcation of the elimination of foreign intercompany dividends. There was no impact on the total loss from continuing operations before income
taxes or on the computation of income tax expense (benefit) for the year end September 30, 2014 and therefore Ashland does not believe that this revision
is material to the previously filed ﬁnancial information.
(0) Related to foreign tax credit carryforward of $24 million and state deferred tax asset valuation allowances of $19 million during 2016.
(d) 2016 and 2015 includes a tax beneﬁt related to credits signed into law on a retroactive basis.
(e) 2016 includes a $3 million beneﬁt and 2014 includes an expense of $5 million recorded for deferred tax adjustments, primarily attributable to state rate
chan es.
(f) 2016ginc1udes tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill impairment.
(g) 2014 includes a $168 million tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and other related matters and a $14
million expense recorded for a rate change in a foreign jurisdiction.
(h) Other items principally includes permanent items in all periods presented, speciﬁcally, 2016 includes expense of $11 million for nondeductible transaction
costs associated with the separation of Valvoline.
The 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix and net unfavorable adjustments primarily related to
a nondeductible goodwill impairment for the Intermediates/ S olvents division, valuation allowances for domestic attributes, accruals
for unrecognized tax benefits and other items related to the separation of Valvoline.
The 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable items predominantly due to certain valuation allowance releases
related to state deferred tax assets. These favorable adjustments were partially oﬂset by an accrual for an unrecognized tax benefit
and tax related to certain global restructuring steps.
Income tax benefit for 2014 included a $168 million tax benefit related to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities for outside
basis diﬁerences and other related matters, a charge of $39 million for taxes associated with the sale of shares of subsidiaries
included in the sale of the Water Technologies business, net charges of $32 million for uncertain tax positions and related matters,
a charge of EB 14 million for a foreign income tax rate change and other net discrete item charges of $7 million primarily related to
changes in valuation allowances.
Unrecognized tax beneﬁts
U. S. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the accounting and financial statement disclosure
of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step
requires Ashland to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on
the technical merits of the position. The second step requires Ashland to recognize in the financial statements each tax position
that meets the more likely than not criteria, measured at the amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
realized. Ashland had $168 million and $144 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $14 million and $16 million relate
to discontinued operations at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the tax rate for continuing and discontinued operations was
$148 million. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain
but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not have an impact
on the eﬁective tax rate.
