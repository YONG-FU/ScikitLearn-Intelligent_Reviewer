N onvested stock awards
Nonvested stock awards are granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date
of grant and generally vest over a one-to-five—year period. However, such shares or units are subject to forfeiture upon termination
of service before the vesting period ends. During 2016, these awards were primarily granted as stock units that will convert to
shares upon vesting, while the grants in prior years were generally made in nonvested shares. Only nonvested stock awards granted
in the form of shares entitle employees or directors to vote the shares. Dividends on nonvested stock awards granted are in the
form of additional units or shares of nonvested stock awards, which are subject to vesting and forfeiture provisions.
A progression of activity and various other information relative to nonvested stock awards is presented in the following table.
