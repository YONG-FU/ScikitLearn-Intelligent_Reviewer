Cash ﬂows generated from operating activities from continuing operations, a major source of Ashland’s liquidity, amounted
to $703 million in 2016, $89 million in 2015 and $580 million in 2014. The significant decline in operating cash ﬂow during the
prior year related primarily to $610 million of pension contributions, which included the $500 million voluntary pension plan
contribution made in June 2015 for plans impacted by the pension settlement program. See Note N in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.
Excluding the voluntary pension contribution in the prior year, the cash results during each year were primarily driven by net
income, excluding discontinued operation results, adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation and amortization
(including debt issuance cost amortization), losses and gains on divestitures as well as changes in working capital, which are
ﬂuctuations within accounts receivable, inventory, trade payables and accrued expenses. Ashland continues to emphasize working
capital management as a high priority and focus.
The following details certain changes in key operating assets and liabilities for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
