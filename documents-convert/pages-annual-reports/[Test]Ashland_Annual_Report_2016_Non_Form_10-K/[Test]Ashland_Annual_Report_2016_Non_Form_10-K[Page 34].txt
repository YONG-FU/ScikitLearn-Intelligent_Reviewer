(5) This figure includes 381,630 shares available for issuance under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees (2005) and
295,389 shares available for issuance under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (2005). Because
these plans are not equity compensation plans as defined by the rules of the NYSE, neither plan required approval by Ashland’s
stockholders. Ashland also granted Mr. Wulfsohn, its Chief Executive Officer, an employment inducement award, in
compliance with Rule 303A.08 of The New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (the “NYSE Manual”), consisting
of a one-time grant of time-vested restricted stock in the amount of 50,000 shares (“2015 Inducement Award”). In 2016,
Ashland also granted Mary Meixelsperger, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of Valvoline Inc., an employment inducement award
in compliance with Rule 303A.08 of the NYSE Manual, consisting of a one-time grant of time-vested restricted stock in the
amount of 4,500 shares (“2016 Inducement Award”). Other than 473 shares registered to cover dividends that are paid in
additional shares of restricted stock under the inducement awards, all shares under the 2015 Inducement Award and 2016
Inducement Award have been granted, are no longer available for future issuance and are not included in this ﬁgure.
