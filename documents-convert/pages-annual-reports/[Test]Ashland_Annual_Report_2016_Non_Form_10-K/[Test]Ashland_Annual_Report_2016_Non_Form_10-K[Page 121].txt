Deferred income taxes are provided for income and expense items recognized in different years for tax and ﬁnancial reporting
purposes. As of September 30, 2016, management intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.5 billion of foreign earnings.
Because these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested, no US. tax provision has been accrued related to the repatriation
of these earnings, and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of US. tax that might be payable if these earnings were ever to
be remitted.
Foreign net operating loss carryforwards primarily relate to certain European and Asian Paciﬁc operations and generally may
be carried forward. US. state net operating loss carryforwards relate to operational losses within certain states and generally may
be carried forward. Temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 30 are
presented in the following table.
