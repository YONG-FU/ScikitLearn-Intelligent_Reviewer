ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Ashland regularly uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to ﬂuctuations in foreign currencies. All derivative
instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash ﬂows or a
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately
to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item, or deferred and recorded in the stockholders’ equity section of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Statements of
Consolidated Comprehensive Income when the hedged item affects net income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value
of a hedge is recognized in income immediately. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, Ashland had not identified any significant
credit risk on open derivative contracts. The potential loss from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates on
Ashland’s open foreign currency derivative instruments at September 30, 2016 would be a $19 million impact on Ashland’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash ﬂows or liquidity. Ashland did not transact or have open any significant
hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements as of and for the year ended September 30,
20 16.
