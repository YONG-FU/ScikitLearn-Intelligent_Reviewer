with the customer and changes in customer payment terms when determining whether the collection of a receivable is reasonably
assured. Past due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is adjusted when it becomes probable a receivable will not be recovered.
A progression of activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is presented in the following table.

Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are primarily stated at cost using the weighted—average cost
method. In addition, certain chemicals and lubricants with a replacement cost of $162 million at September 30, 2016 and $170
million at September 30, 2015 are valued at cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
The following summarizes Ashland’s inventories as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet dates.

Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Buildings are depreciated principally over 25 to 35 years and machinery and equipment principally over 2 to 25 years. Such
costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other
factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines and technological obsolescence. Recorded values of asset groups
of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash ﬂows are written
down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash ﬂows (assets held for use) or
net realizable value (assets held for sale).
Goodwill and other intangibles
Ashland tests goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of July 1 and when events and
circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Ashland reviews goodwill for impairment based on its identiﬁed
reporting units, which are defined as operating segments or groupings of businesses one level below the operating segment
level. Ashland tests goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value of its reporting units,
determined using a combination of discounted cash ﬂow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public
companies in each reporting unit’s industry peer group, when externally quoted market prices are not readily available. If this
