NOTE N — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (continued)
$31 million and actuarial loss of $ 140 million during the year ended September 30, 2014. Of these amounts, all of the curtailment
gain and $27 million of the actuarial loss were attributable to the Water Technologies business and included in the discontinued
operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income during 2014.
Components of net periodic beneﬁt costs (income)
For segment reporting purposes, service cost for continuing operations is proportionately allocated to each reportable segment,
excluding the Unallocated and other segment, while all other costs for continuing operations are recorded within the Unallocated
and other segment. During the year ended September 30, 20 14, income of $7 million, representing a portion of the other components
of pension and other postretirement beneﬁt costs (i.e., interest cost, expected return on assets, and amortization of prior service
credit) related to Water Technologies, was reclassified to discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive
Income.
The following table summarizes the components of pension and other postretirement beneﬁt costs for both continuing and
discontinued operations and the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs (income) for the plans.

(a) Changes to the post—65 Ashland Medical plan resulted in negative plan amendments that were amortized within the other postretirement benefits caption
during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Pension and other postretirement plan changes announced in March 2016 resulted in negative plan amendments that are being
amortized within this caption during 2016.
(b) The plan assumptions discussed are a blended weighted-average rate for Ashland’s U. S. and non-US. plans. The US. pension plan represented approximately
88% of the projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2016. Other postretirement beneﬁt plans consist of US. and Canada, with the US. plan representing
approximately 89% of the accumulated postretirement beneﬁt obligation at September 30, 2016. Non-US. plans use assumptions generally consistent with
those of US. plans.
(0) Weighted-average discount rates in 2016 reﬂect the adoption of the full yield curve approach.
