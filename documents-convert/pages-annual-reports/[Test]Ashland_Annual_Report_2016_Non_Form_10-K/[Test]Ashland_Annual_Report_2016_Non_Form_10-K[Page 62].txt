while changes in volume and product mix increased sales by $33 million.
Gross profit during 2015 decreased $47 million compared to 2014. Gross profit in 2015 included $17 million of severance

currency exchange of $22 million. Additionally, research and development expenses decreased $2 million compared to 2014 as
there were noncash impairments related to certain IPR&D assets of $1 1 million and $13 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively.

EBI T DA and Adjusted EBI T DA reconciliation
The following EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the three annual periods is provided as a means to enhance
the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for
the results of Specialty Ingredients. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland’s
operations, which exclude certain key items. The current year included $4 million of restructuring charges, partially offset by a
$5 million income adjustment to a severance accrual. The prior year included $17 million of severance and other costs related to
a manufacturing facility restructuring plan during 2015. The $4 million and $6 million of accelerated depreciation in 2016 and
2015, respectively, relates to a manufacturing facility restructuring plan while the $19 million charge during 2014 related to the
impairment of a foreign operation. The $13 million adjustment during 2015 related to a customer claim while the $5 million
during 2016 was a subsequent adjustment to the customer claim. There were environmental reserve adjustments of $2 million,
$3 million and $1 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impairments of $11 million and $ 13 million during 2015
and 2014, respectively, relate to certain IPR&D assets associated with the acquisition of ISP during 2011.
