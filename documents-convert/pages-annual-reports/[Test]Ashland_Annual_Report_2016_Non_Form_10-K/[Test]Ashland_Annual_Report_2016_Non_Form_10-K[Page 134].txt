NOTE 0 — LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES (continued)
During 2016, Ashland entered into settlement agreements totaling $4 million with certain insurers, which resulted in a reduction
of the Ashland insurance receivable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the same amount. Ashland placed $4 million of
the settlement funds into the renewable annual trust.
A progression of activity in the Ashland insurance receivable is presented in the following table.

Hercules asbestos-related litigation
Hercules has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. Such claims typically arise from
alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of Hercules” former
subsidiaries to a limited industrial market. The amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can ﬂuctuate from
period to period. A summary of Hercules’ asbestos claims activity follows.

Hercules asbestos-related liability
From the range of estimates, Ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation
defense and claim settlement costs, which generally approximates the mid-point of the estimated range of exposure from model
results. Ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non-inﬂated, non-
discounted approximate 50-year model developed with the assistance of HR&A. As a result of the most recent annual update of
this estimate, completed during 2016, it was determined that the liability for Hercules asbestos-related claims should be increased
by $25 million. Total reserves for asbestos claims were $321 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $311 million at
September 30, 2015.
A progression of activity in the asbestos reserve is presented in the following table.

Hercules asbestos-related receivables
For the Hercules asbestos-related obligations, certain reimbursement obligations pursuant to coverage-in—place agreements
with insurance carriers exist. As a result, any increases in the asbestos reserve have been partially oﬁset by probable insurance
recoveries. Ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on
management’s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage, including an assumption
that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent. The estimated receivable consists exclusively of solvent domestic insurers.
As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the receivables from insurers amounted to $63 million and $56 million,
respectively. During 2016, the annual update of the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on
