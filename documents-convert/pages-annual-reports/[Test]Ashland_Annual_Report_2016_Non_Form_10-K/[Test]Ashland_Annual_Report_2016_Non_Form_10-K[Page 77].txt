OFF -BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
As part of its normal course of business, Ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments. These
arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
possibility that Ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent
on the performance of the guaranteed party, or the occurrence of future events that Ashland is unable to predict. Ashland has
reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with US. GAAP.
