NOTE I — GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES (continued)
use of a combination of discounted cash ﬂow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies
in each reporting unit’s industry peer group. Discounted cash ﬂow models are highly reliant on various assumptions. Significant
assumptions Ashland utilized in these models for the current year included: projected business results and future industry direction,
long-term growth factors and weighted-average cost of capital. Ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates
of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to Ashland’s market capitalization, and implied
control premium, to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators. Subsequent changes in
these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews.
In conjunction with the July 1, 2016 annual assessment of goodwill, Ashland’s valuation techniques did not indicate any
impairment for Specialty Ingredients, Composites, Core North America, Quick Lubes or International. Due to deterioration in the
butanediol commodity market during 2016 in which the Intermediates/ Solvents reporting unit operates (and the impact thereof on
Ashland’s most recently completed three-year business plan), Ashland determined that the carrying value of the Intermediates/
Solvents reporting unit exceeded its fair value at July 1, 2016, which resulted in the reporting unit failing the first step of the
goodwill impairment test. Ashland then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which involved, among other
things, obtaining third-party appraisals of substantially all of Intermediates/Solvents tangible and intangible assets. Based on the
results of its goodwill impairment testing as of July 1, 2016, Ashland recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $171
million in the fourth quarter of 20 1 6, which is in addition to a $10 million impairment related to Intermediates/S olvents property,
plant and equipment, resulted in a total $181 million impairment charge for Intermediates/ Solvents during 2016. A portion of the
goodwill impairment was nondeductible.
Ashland’s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these remaining assets currently classified as having indefinite lives,
including goodwill, could result in additional impairment charges in future periods if any or all of the following events were to
occur with respect to a particular reporting unit: a significant change in projected business results, a divestiture decision, increase
in Ashland’s weighted-average cost of capital rates, decrease in growth rates or other assumptions, economic deterioration that is
more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated, or another significant economic event.

(a) As of September 30, 2016, goodwill was completely attributable to the Composites reporting unit due to the full impairment of the goodwill for the
Intermediates/Solvents reporting unit during 2016. Accumulated impairment for the reportable segment was $171 million at September 30, 2016.
(b) As of September 30, 2016, goodwill consisted of $89 million for the Core North America reporting unit, $135 million for the Quick Lubes reporting unit
and $39 million for the International reporting unit.
(0) Relates to $83 million for the acquisition of Oil Can Henry’s and $11 million for Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM center acquisitions during 2016. See Note
B for more information on the acquisition of Oil Can Henry’s. Relates to Valvoline Instant Oil ChangeSM acquisitions during 2015.
(d) Divestitures caption represents the amounts of goodwill related to the Specialty Ingredients joint venture during 2016 and the sale of Elastomers, Valvoline
car care products and industrial biocides during 2015. See Notes B and C for additional information.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets principally consist of trademarks and trade names, intellectual property, customer relationships and in—process
research and development (IPR&D). Intangible assets classified as finite are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated
useful lives. The cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over 3 to 25 years, intellectual property over 5 to
20 years and customer relationships over 3 to 24 years.
During 20 15 and 20 14, there was impairments of certain IPR&D assets associated with the acquisition of International Specialty
Products Inc. (ISP) of $ 1 1 million and $13 million, respectively, which were classified within the research and development expense
caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income. These impairments represented Level 2 nonrecurring fair value
measurements. As of September 30, 2015, IPR&D and certain intangible assets within trademarks and tradenames were classified
