The total reserves for environmental remediation reﬂect Ashland’s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over
an extended period to remediate identiﬁed conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-
party recoveries. Engineering studies, probability techniques, historical experience and other factors are used to identify and
evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental
remediation. Ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental
remediation continues. Ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental
reserve based on management’s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage. At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, Ashland’s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was $23 million, of which
$15 million and $16 million, respectively, were classiﬁed in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Components of environmental remediation expense included within the selling, general and administrative expense caption
of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income are presented in the following table for the years ended September 30,
2016, 2015 and 2014.

(a) Net expense of $2 million, $5 million and $4 million for the ﬁscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, relates to divested businesses
which qualified for treatment as discontinued operations and for which certain environmental liabilities were retained by Ashland. These amounts are
classified within the income from discontinued operations caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.
Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that aﬁect Ashland’s ability to estimate
its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup
efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental
regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of
other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of
environmental remediation, Ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for
identified sites could be as high as approximately $380 million. No individual remediation location is significant, as the largest
reserve for any site is less than 15% of the remediation reserve.
Other legal proceedings and claims
In addition to the matters described above, there are other various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings pending
or threatened against Ashland and its current and former subsidiaries. Such actions are with respect to commercial matters, product
liability, toxic tort liability, and other environmental matters, which seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial
amounts. While Ashland cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, it believes that adequate reserves have been
recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions were immaterial as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. There
is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred related to these actions; however,
Ashland believes that such potential losses were immaterial as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. For additional information on
legal proceedings and claims, see the Legal Proceedings section of Form 10-K (Part I, Item 3).
