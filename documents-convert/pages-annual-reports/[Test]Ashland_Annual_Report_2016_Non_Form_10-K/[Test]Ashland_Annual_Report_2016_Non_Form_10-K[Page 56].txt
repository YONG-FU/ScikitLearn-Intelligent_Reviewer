Interest expense and other financing costs, excluding interest income and available-for—sale securities income, increased $13
million in 2016 compared to 2015. The current year included interest expense of $10 million related to accelerated debt issuance
costs associated with the current year financing activities compared to $2 million of accelerated amortization for previously
capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs recognized immediately during 2015 associated with the
2015 refinancing activities. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher debt levels maintained in 2016 compared
to 2015. Changes in other financing costs for the current year compared to the prior year is primarily the result of a $9 million charge
related to the early redemption premium payment for the tender of the 2016 senior notes in the prior year. Available—for—sale
securities income of $8 million compared to $3 million in the prior year which represents investment income related to restricted
investments discussed in Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest expense and other financing costs, excluding interest income and available-for-sale securities income, increased $11
million in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding certain current year charges associated with the 2015 refinancing, interest expense
remained relatively consistent with the prior year as generally lower interest rates offset higher debt levels during the year. As
previously noted, 2015 included certain charges related to the 2015 refinancing. These included $2 million of accelerated
amortization for previously capitalized debt issuance costs and $2 million of new debt issuance costs recognized immediately
associated with the 2015 refinancing activities. Other financing costs included a $9 million charge related to the early redemption
premium payment for the tender of the 2016 senior notes. The available-for—sale securities income of $3 million represents
investment income related to the restricted investments discussed in Note G of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
