NOTE N — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (continued)
Security Act of 1974. Specifically, MAP-21 allows for the use of a 25-year average interest rate within an upper and lower range
for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years, as was
previously required.
During fiscal 2016 and 2015, Ashland contributed $23 million and $596 million, respectively, to its US. pension plans and
$12 million and $14 million, respectively, to its non-U.S. pension plans. The 2015 contributions included $500 million to the US.
pension plans impacted by the pension plan settlement program discussed previously. Ashland expects to contribute approximately
$15 million to its non-qualified U.S. pension plans and $10 million to its non-U.S. pension plans during 2017.

NOTE 0 — LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES
Asbestos litigation
Ashland and Hercules have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos. To assist in
developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various
assumptions, Ashland retained Hamilton, Rabinovitz & Associates, Inc. (HR&A). The methodology used by HR&A to project
future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim-filing and settlement rates, disease mix, enacted
legislation, open claims and litigation defense. The claim experience of Ashland and Hercules are separately compared to the
results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos—
related diseases. Those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been
exposed to asbestos. Using that information, HR&A estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed, as well
as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims. Changes in asbestos-related liabilities and receivables are
recorded on an after-tax basis within the discontinued operations caption in the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income.
Ashland asbestos-related litigation
The claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against Ashland result primarily from
indemnification obligations undertaken in 1990 in connection with the sale of Riley, a former subsidiary. The amount and timing
of settlements and number of open claims can ﬂuctuate from period to period. A summary of Ashland asbestos claims activity,
excluding Hercules claims, follows.
