NOTE Q — STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS
Ashland has stock incentive plans under which key employees or directors are granted stock appreciation rights (SARs),
performance share awards or nonvested stock awards. Each program is typically a long-term incentive plan designed to link
employee compensation with increased shareholder value or reward superior performance and encourage continued employment
with Ashland. Ashland recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of stock-based awards over the applicable
vesting period. The components of Ashland’s pretax stock-based awards (net of forfeitures), which is included within the selling,
general and administrative expense caption of the Statements of Consolidated Comprehensive Income, and associated income tax
benefits are as follows:

Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)
SARs are granted to employees or directors at a price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and
typically become exercisable over periods of one to three years. Unexercised SARs lapse ten years and one month after the date
of grant. Ashland estimates the fair value of SARs granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires
several assumptions, which Ashland has developed and updates based on historical trends and current market observations. The
accuracy of these assumptions is critical to the estimate of fair value for these equity instruments. The following table illustrates
the weighted-average of key assumptions used within the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The risk-free interest rate
assumption was based on the U. S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for the expected term of the instrument. The
dividend yield reﬂects the assumption that the current dividend payout will continue with no anticipated increases. The volatility
assumption was calculated by utilizing an unbiased standard deviation of Ashland’s Common Stock closing price for the past five
years. The expected life is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
