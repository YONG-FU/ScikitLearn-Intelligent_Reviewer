Performance Materials
Performance Materials is a global leader in unsaturated polyester resins and vinyl ester resins. The business unit has leading
positions in gelcoats, maleic anhydride, butanediol, tetrahydrofuran, N—Methylpyrrolidone and other intermediates and solvents.
Key customers include: manufacturers of residential and commercial building products; industrial product specifiers and
manufacturers; wind blade and pipe manufacturers; automotive and truck OEM suppliers; boatbuilders; engineered plastics and
electronic producers; and specialty chemical manufacturers.
Elastomers results were included in the Performance Materials reportable segment results of operations within the Statements
of Consolidated Comprehensive Income until its December 1, 2014 sale. For additional information on the divestiture of the
Elastomers division, see Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
2016 compared to 2015
Performance Materials’ sales decreased $227 million, or 20%, to $930 million in 2016. Lower product pricing decreased
sales by $111 million, or 10%, and the divestiture of the Elastomers division resulted in a loss of sales of $40 million, or 3%.
Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower volume each decreased sales by $26 million, or 2%. Changes in product mix
decreased sales by $24 million, or 2%.
Gross profit decreased $37 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of Intermediates/Solvents
performance. Gross profit in the prior year was negatively impacted by $14 million of costs associated with plant maintenance
shutdowns within Intermediates/ S olvents manufacturing facilities, while the current year included $4 million of incremental costs
associated with an unplanned shutdown also within an Intermediates/ Solvents manufacturing facility. Pricing declines, partially
offset by lower raw material costs, also decreased gross proﬁt by $29 million. Changes in product mix and volume combined to
decrease gross profit by $10 million. The sale of Elastomers and unfavorable foreign currency exchange each decreased gross
profit by $4 million. In total, gross profit margin during 2016 increased 0.6 percentage points as compared to 2015 to 19.4%.
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $167 million during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the $181
million non-cash long-lived asset impairment within Intermediates/ S olvents during the current year. See further discussion of this
impairment within the “Critical Accounting Policies” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis herein. Additionally, the
impairment was partially offset by decreased incentive compensation of $6 million, the sale of the Elastomers division of $3
million and a favorable foreign currency exchange of $3 million. Equity and other income decreased $1 million compared to the
prior year.
Operating loss totaled $118 million in 2016 compared to income of $87 million in 2015. EBITDA decreased $211 million
to a loss of $65 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $30 million to $116 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin
decreased 0.1 percentage points to 12.5% in 2016.
2015 compared to 2014
Performance Materials’ sales decreased $425 million, or 27%, to $1,157 million in 2015. The divestiture of the Elastomers
division decreased sales by $237 million, or 15%. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower product pricing within both
Composites and Intermediates/Solvents divisions decreased sales by $87 million, or 5%, and $81 million, or 5%, respectively.
Unfavorable foreign currency exchange was due to the U. S. dollar strengthening compared to various foreign currencies, primarily
the Euro. Volume and changes in product mix decreased sales by $13 million and $7 million, respectively.
Gross profit increased $10 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Gross profit in 2015 included $30 million of costs associated
with plant closures resulting from the 2014 global restructuring program as well as $35 million of gross profit related to the
