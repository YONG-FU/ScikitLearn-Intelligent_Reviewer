The 2016 eﬁective tax rate was impacted by jurisdictional income mix and net unfavorable adjustments primarily related to
a nondeductible goodwill impairment for the Intermediates/ S olvents division, valuation allowances for domestic attributes, accruals
for unrecognized tax benefits and other items related to the separation of Valvoline.
The 2015 effective tax rate was impacted by net favorable items predominantly due to certain valuation allowance releases
related to state deferred tax assets. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by an accrual for an unrecognized tax benefit
and tax related to certain global restructuring steps.

basis differences and other related matters, a charge of $39 million for taxes associated with the sale of shares of subsidiaries
