Elastomers division. Gross profit in 2015 was negatively impacted by plant maintenance shutdowns at both Intermediates/ S olvents
manufacturing facilities which resulted in a $14 million decrease in gross profit. Lower input costs, partially offset by pricing
declines, within both Composites and Intermediates/Solvents combined to increase gross profit by $55 million. Unfavorable
currency exchange, driven by the US. dollar strengthening compared to certain foreign currencies, and changes in volume and
product mix combined to decrease gross profit by $14 million and $12 million, respectively. In total, gross profit margin during
2015 increased 5.7 percentage points as compared to 2014 to 18.8%.
Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $30 million, or 18%, during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to
the sale of the Elastomers division, which included $19 million of costs in 2014, as well as $4 million in expense savings realized
from the 2014 global restructuring program, and favorable foreign currency exchange of $5 million. These decreases were partially
offset by an increase in incentive compensation. There was also a $5 million legal reserve charge during 2014.
Equity and other income increased $40 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $50 million impairment
for the ASK joint venture equity investment during 2014, partially offset by a $10 million decrease due to the loss of equity income
from the ASK joint venture as a result of its June 2014 sale.
Operating income totaled $87 million in 2015 compared to $7 million in 2014. EBITDA increased $65 million to $146 million
in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $20 million to $146 million in 2015. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 2.1 percentage
points to 12.6% in 2015.

the understanding of financial measurements that Ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for
the results of Performance Materials. Adjusted EBITDA results have been prepared to illustrate the ongoing effects of Ashland’s
operations, which exclude certain key items such as the $181 million impairment during 2016 related to Intermediates/Solvents
and $50 million charge during 2014 related to the impairment of the ASK joint venture equity investment. The $13 million and
$17 million of severance and accelerated depreciation, respectively, during 2014 related to the 2014 global restructuring program.

Adjusted EBITDA during 2015.
