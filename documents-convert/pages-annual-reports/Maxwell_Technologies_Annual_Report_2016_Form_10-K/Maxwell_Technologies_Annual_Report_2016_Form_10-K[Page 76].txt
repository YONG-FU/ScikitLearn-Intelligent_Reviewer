Note 13—Pensi0n and Other Postretirement Beneﬁt Plans
Foreign Plan
The Compensation—Retirement Beneﬁts Subtopic of the F ASB ASC requires balance sheet recognition of the total over funded or underfunded status of
pension and postretirement beneﬁt plans. Under the guidance, actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and any remaining transition assets or
obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) within stockholders” equity, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost (income).
The Company’s plan is regulated by the Swiss Government and is funded by the employees and the Company. The pension benefit is based on
compensation, length of service and credited investment earnings. The plan guarantees both a minimum rate of return as well as minimum annuity purchase rates.
The Company’s funding policy with respect to the pension plan is to contribute the amount required by Swiss law, using the required percentage applied to the
employee’s compensation. In addition, participating employees are required to contribute to the pension plan. The Company made pension contributions of $0.6
million , $0.6 million and $0.7 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively; approximately 45% of the total contributions to the plan each year are made by the
employees. This plan has a measurement date of December 31. The Company does not have any rights to the assets of the plan other than the right to offset the
liabilities of the plan.
The net pension asset increased from $5.8 million to $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 . The increase in plan assets was primarily due to
a higher return on plan assets than expected, demographic and assumption changes made to reﬂect current market conditions, as well as higher than expected
withdrawal and mortality experience during the year. The accumulated benefit obligation was $29.4 million and $31.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 ,
respectively. The decrease in the benefit obligation was primarily due to higher than expected withdrawal and mortality experience and a higher amount of benefits
paid during the year than new obligations incurred. The plan is fully funded and continues to be in a surplus condition.
