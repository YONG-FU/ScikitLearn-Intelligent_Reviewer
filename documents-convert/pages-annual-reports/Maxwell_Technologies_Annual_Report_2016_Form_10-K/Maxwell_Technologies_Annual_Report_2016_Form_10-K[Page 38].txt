Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 decreased by $4.5 million , or 11% , compared with 2015 . This decrease primarily related to a decrease
of $1 .7 million in labor costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our restructuring and sale of the microelectronics product line, a decrease of $1 .7
million related to lower legal costs associated with the ongoing SEC and F CPA investigations, a decrease of $1.3 million related to the release of a foreign payroll
tax liability due to the lapse of a statute of limitations, as well as various expense savings related to our restructuring and cost reduction efforts and sale of the
microelectronics product line. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $1.2 million in stock compensation expense related to our 2016 management
bonus plan, whereas our bonus plan was suspended for 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 30% of revenue, up from 24% in 2015 , as
revenue proportionately decreased more than expenses between the periods.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2015 decreased by $2.3 million, or 5%, compared with 2014. The decrease primarily related to a $1.0
million decrease in overall labor costs associated with reduced headcount as a result of our restructuring efforts and the elimination of our management bonus
program for 2015. In addition, there was a $1.1 million reduction in recruiting costs, a $0.7 million decrease in travel costs, a $0.7 million decrease in consulting
costs, a $0.5 million decrease in information technology and facilities costs, as well as other expense savings, primarily related to our restructuring and cost
reduction efforts. Also, in the third quarter of 2015, we received a $0.5 million refund of value-added-taxes related to our operations in China. These decreases
were partially offset by an increase in legal fees of $2.6 million incurred in 2015 due to the ongoing SEC and F CPA investigations. Selling, general and
administrative expenses were 24% of revenue for 2015, consistent with 24% for 2014.
