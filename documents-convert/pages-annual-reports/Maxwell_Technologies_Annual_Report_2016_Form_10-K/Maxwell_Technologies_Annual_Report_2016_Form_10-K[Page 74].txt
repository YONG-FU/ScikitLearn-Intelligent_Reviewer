The provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations differs from the amount calculated by applying the statutory
income tax rate to loss before income taxes. The primary components of such difference are as follows (in thousands):

The Company has established a valuation allowance against its US. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of
such assets as evidenced by the cumulative losses from operations through December 31, 2016 . Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the
deferred tax assets. At such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced
accordingly and recorded as a tax benefit, with the exception of $15.5 million which will impact additional paid in capital as discussed below. The Company has
recorded a valuation allowance of $78.4 million as of December 31, 2016 to reﬂect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The
Company increased its valuation allowance by $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
At December 31, 2016 , the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $186.8 million and $48.4 million ,
respectively. The federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 and the state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2016. In addition, the
Company has research and development and other tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes as of December 31, 2016 of $6.9 million and
$8.6 million , respectively. The federal credits will begin to expire in 2019 unless utilized and the state credits have an indefinite life. Pursuant to Internal Revenue
Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the Company’s federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited upon a cumulative change in ownership of
more than 50% within a three-year period.
Excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises, restricted stock unit vesting, restricted stock grants, and disqualifying dispositions of both
incentive stock options and stock issued from the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the amount of $3.5 million for 2016 and 2015 , did not reduce
current income taxes payable and, accordingly, are not included in the deferred tax asset relating to net operating loss carryforwards, but are included with the
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards disclosed in this footnote. The tax beneﬁts associated with stock option deductions from 1998 to 2005 in the
amount of $15.5 million were not recorded in additional paid-in capital because their realization was not more likely than not to occur and, consequently, a
valuation allowance was recorded against the entire benefit.
The Company was granted a tax holiday in Switzerland, which was effective as of January 1, 2012 for up to 10 years. The tax holiday is conditioned upon the
Company meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. As of January 1, 2017, the Company is no longer eligible for the tax holiday due to not meeting
the employment threshold. The impact of the tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $0.6 million and $0.7 million for 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The benefit of
the tax holiday on net loss per diluted share was $0.02 for 2016 and 2015 .
The Company records US. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries” earnings are considered indefinitely
reinvested outside of the US. As of December 31, 2016 , the Company has recorded a $4.9 million deferred tax liability for Swiss withholding taxes associated
with $97.6 million of undistributed earnings of its Swiss subsidiary that are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the Company repatriates
these funds, this withholding tax would become payable to the Swiss government. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , income tax expense
associated with undistributed earnings of its Swiss subsidiary that are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested was $1.2 million , $2.1 million and $1.6 million ,
respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , there were no undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized
deferred income tax liability on the excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practicable because of the
complexities of the hypothetical calculation.
