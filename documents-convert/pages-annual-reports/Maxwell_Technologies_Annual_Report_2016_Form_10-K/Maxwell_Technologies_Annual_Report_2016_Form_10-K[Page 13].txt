Establishing and protecting proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our corporate strategy. Although we attempt to protect our intellectual
property rights through patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other measures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent
infringement, misappropriation or other misuse by third parties, or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries, which may not protect our
intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the US.
We use employee and third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. We require each of our
employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all our proprietary
information and, subject to certain exceptions, to assign to us all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during
his or her employment with us. In addition, we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties, such as potential product development partners and
customers, to protect any information disclosed in the pursuit of securing possible fruitful business endeavors.
