In June 2015, the Company ceased use of approximately 60,000 square feet of its Peoria, AZ manufacturing facility, and determined this leased space would
have no future economic benefit to the Company based on the current business forecast. As a result, in June 2015, the Company recorded a liability for the future
rent obligation associated with this space, net of estimated sublease income, in accordance with ASC Topic 420. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the
expense related to the exit of this leased space was $1.2 million , before tax, and was recorded as a component of total restructuring and exit costs. During the year
ended December 31, 2016 , the Company recorded additional restructuring and exit costs of $0.1 million related to revisions to the sublease income assumption.
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded total charges related to its restructuring plan of $0.3 million and $2.5 million ,
respectively, within “restructuring and exit costs” in the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recorded $0.1 million and $0.4 million , respectively, of accelerated depreciation expense within “cost of revenue” in the consolidated statements of
operations.
As of December 31, 2016 , the Company’s consolidated balance sheet includes restructuring liability associated with lease obligation costs of $0.3 million in
“accounts payable and accrued liabilities” and $0.5 million in “other long term liabilities.”

Note 6—Credit Facilities
Revolving Line of Credit
In July 2015, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with East West Bank (“EWB”), whereby EWB made
available to the Company a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Line of Credit”). The Revolving Line of Credit is
available up to a maximum of the lesser of: (a) $25.0 million ; or (b) a certain percentage of domestic and foreign trade receivables. As of December 31, 2016 the
amount available under the Revolving Line of Credit was $11.4 million . In general, amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit are secured by a lien on
all of the Company’s assets, including its intellectual property, as well as a pledge of 100% of its equity interests in Maxwell SA. The obligations under the Loan
Agreement are also guaranteed directly by Maxwell SA. The Revolving Line of Credit will mature on July 3, 2018. In the event that the Company is in violation of
the representations, warranties and covenants made in the Loan Agreement, including certain financial covenants set forth therein, the Company may not be able to
utilize the Revolving Line of Credit or repayment of amounts owed pursuant to the Loan Agreement could be accelerated. The Company is currently in compliance
with the financial covenants that it is required to meet during the term of the credit agreement including the minimum four-quarter rolling EBITDA, quarterly
minimum quick ratio and monthly minimum cash requirements. On March 1, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement to approve the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets and business of Nesscap Energy, Inc., and to modify certain financial covenants.
Am0unts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit bear interest, payable monthly. Such interest shall accrue based upon, at the Company’s election,
subject to certain limitations, either the Prime Rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 0.50% or the LIBOR Rate plus a margin ranging from 2.75% to 3.25% , the
specific rate for each as determined based upon the Company’s leverage ratio from time to time.
