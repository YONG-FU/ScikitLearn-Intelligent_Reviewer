Note 3—Goodwill
The Company performs an impairment test for goodwill annually according to the Intangibles—Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC. The Company
ﬁrst makes a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of goodwill impairment and if it concludes that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a
reporting unit is greater than its fair value, then it will be required to perform the ﬁrst step of a two-step quantitative impairment test. Otherwise, performing the
two-step impairment test is not required. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market
structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices and ﬁnancial performance of the
reporting unit. The Company may also determine to skip the qualitative assessment in any year and move directly to the quantitative test.
The ﬁrst step of the two-step quantitative impairment test consists of estimating the fair value and comparing the estimated fair value with the carrying value
of the reporting unit. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an
implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s assets and
liabilities from its estimated total fair value, which was calculated in step one. An impairment charge would represent the excess of the carrying amount of the
reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill. The guidance requires goodwill to be reviewed annually at the same time every year or when
an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. The Company selected December 31 as its annual testing
date.
