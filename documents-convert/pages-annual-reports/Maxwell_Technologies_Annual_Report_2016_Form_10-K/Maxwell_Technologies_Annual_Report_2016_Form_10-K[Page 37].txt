The decrease in ultracapacitor product revenue was driven by lower sales volume of $44.9 million which was primarily due to government subsidy program
changes in China, particularly a proposed requirement to localize product manufacturing, which significantly decreased sales of hybrid transit vehicle applications.
The lower hybrid transit vehicle volume was partially offset by higher volume for rail transit applications. Ultracapacitor product revenue was also negatively
affected by lower prices of $2.3 million and positively impacted by $4.2 million of other changes primarily related to product mix.
Revenue for our high-voltage products increased by $3.5 million to $45.2 million in 2016 , compared with $41.7 million for the prior year. This increase was
primarily driven by increased infrastructure renewal investment by the Canadian government. Revenue for our microelectronics products decreased by $6.6 million
to $4.6 million for the 2016 compared with $11.1 million for the 2015 , due to the sale of this product line in April 2016.
Revenue in 2015 decreased 10% to $167.4 million, compared with $186.6 million in 2014. This decrease was inﬂuenced primarily by lower revenue for our
ultracapacitor product line, which decreased to $114.5 million in 2015 compared with $135.6 million in the prior year.
The decrease in ultracapacitor product revenue in 2015 primarily related to decreased sales for rail transit, wind energy, automotive and other markets. This
decrease was composed of lower prices of $19.3 million and decreases due to product mix and other factors of $1.8 million, while volumes in 2015 and 2014 were
comparable. Changes in the China government subsidy program and other market factors significantly contributed to lower pricing in 2015.
Revenue for our high-voltage capacitor products totaled $41.7 million for 2015, an increase of 3% from the $40.4 million recorded in 2014, primarily related
to sales of newly developed products in 2015. Revenue from our microelectronic products totaled $11.1 million for 2015, up 5% from the $10.6 million recorded in
2014, as revenue for this product line varied based on the timing of governmental and commercial programs.
The following table presents revenue mix by product line for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 :
Years Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
’Ultracapacitors 59% 68% 73% ‘
High-voltage capacitors 37% 25% 21%
’Microelectronics products 4% 7% 6%
Total 100% 100% 100%
A substantial amount of our revenue is generated through our Swiss subsidiary which has a functional currency of the Swiss Franc. As such, reported revenue
can be materially impacted by changes in exchange rates between the Swiss Franc and the US. Dollar, our reporting currency. Due to the strengthening of the
US. Dollar against the Swiss Franc during 2016 compared with 2015 , revenue was negatively impacted by $1.1 million. Due to the strengthening of the
US. Dollar against the Swiss Franc during 2015 compared with 2014 , revenue was negatively impacted by $2.0 million.
Gross Proﬁt and Gross Margin.
During 2016 , gross proﬁt decreased $18.0 million , or 35% , to $33.0 million compared with $51.0 million in the prior year. This decrease was associated
with lower revenue, primarily due to lower sales volume, an increase in product costs due to higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with the lower sales volume,
as well as a less signiﬁcant impact from a reduction in pricing for our ultracapacitor products. As a percentage of revenue, gross margin decreased to 27% in 2016
compared with 30% in the prior year. This decrease was primarily associated with a change in product mix which no longer includes sales of higher margin
microelectronics products, an increase in product costs due to higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with the lower sales volume, as well as a less significant
impact from a reduction in pricing for our ultracapacitor products.
During 2015 , gross profit decreased $17.5 million, or 26%, to $51.0 million compared with $68.4 million in 2014. This decrease was associated with lower
revenue which primarily related to lower prices for our ultracapacitor products sold into the Chinese hybrid transit vehicle market. As a percentage of revenue,
gross margin decreased to 30% in 2015 compared with 37% in 2014. This decrease was primarily associated with the reduction in pricing for our ultracapacitor
products.
