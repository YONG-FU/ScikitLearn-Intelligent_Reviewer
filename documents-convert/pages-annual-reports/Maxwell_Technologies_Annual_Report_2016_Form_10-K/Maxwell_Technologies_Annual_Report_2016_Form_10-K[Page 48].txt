Fair Value Risk
We have a net pension asset of $8.9 million at December 31, 2016 , including plan assets of $39.1 million , which are recorded at fair value. The plan assets
consist of 52% debt and equity securities, 43% real estate investment funds and 5% cash and cash equivalents. The fair value measurement of real estate
investment funds is subject to the real estate market forces in Switzerland. The fair value of debt and equity securities is determined based on quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets and is subject to interest rate risk. We manage our risk by having a diversified portfolio. See Note 13 to the consolidated
Ô¨Ånancial statements for further discussion on the pension assets.
