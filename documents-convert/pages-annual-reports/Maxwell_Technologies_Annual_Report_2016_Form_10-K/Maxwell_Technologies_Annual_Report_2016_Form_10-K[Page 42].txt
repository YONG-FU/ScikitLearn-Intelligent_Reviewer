We are required to pay an annual commitment fee equal to $125,000, and an unused commitment fee of the average daily unused amount of the Revolving
Line of Credit, payable monthly, equal to a per annum rate in a range of 0.30% to 0.50%, as determined by our leverage ratio on the last day of the previous ﬁscal
quarter. No amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit as of December 31, 2016 .
Former Credit Facility
In December 2011, we obtained a secured credit facility in the form of a revolving line of credit (the “Former Revolving Line of Credit”) and an equipment
term loan (the “Equipment Term Loan”) (together, the “Former Credit Facility”). Borrowings under the Former Credit Facility bore interest, payable monthly, at
either (i) the bank’s prime rate or (ii) LIBOR plus 2.25%, at our option, subject to certain limitations. The Equipment Term Loan was available to ﬁnance 80% of
eligible equipment purchases made between April 1, 2011 and April 30, 2012. During this period, we borrowed $5.0 million under the Equipment Term Loan.
The balance of the Equipment Term Loan was paid in full by the maturity date of April 30, 2015. Concurrently with entering into the Loan Agreement
described above, in July 2015, we repaid all outstanding loans under the Former Revolving Line of Credit and terminated the Former Credit Facility. We did not
incur any early termination or prepayment penalties under the Former Credit Facility in connection with the above transactions.
Other long-term borrowings
Maxwell SA has various financing agreements for vehicles. These agreements are for up to an original three-year repayment period with interest rates
ranging from 0.9% to 3.9% . At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $83,000 and $91,000 , respectively, was outstanding under these agreements.

(1) Operating lease obligations primarily represent building leases.
(2) Purchase commitments primarily represent the value of non-cancellable purchase orders and an estimate of purchase orders that if canceled would result in a
signiﬁcant penalty.
(3) Debt obligations represent long-term and short-term borrowings related to financing agreements for vehicles.
(4) Pension beneﬁt payments represent the expected amounts to be paid for pension benefits.
(5) The table excludes $0.3 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future
payments, if required.
(5) The table excludes deferred tax liability of $4.9 million due to uncertainty of timing of future payments. This deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings
of a foreign subsidiary represents deferred tax expense associated with a portion of the unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are not considered
permanently reinvested.
Critical Accounting Estimates
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time
the accounting estimate was made and 2) changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we
reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Form 10-K, which discusses the signiﬁcant accounting policies.
