Investment objectives:
The primary investment goal of the pension plan is to achieve a total annualized return of 3.00% over the long-term. The investments are evaluated,
compared and benchmarked to plans with similar investment strategies. The plan also attempts to minimize risk by not having any single security or class of
securities with a disproportionate impact on the plan. As a guideline, assets are diversified by asset classes (equity, ﬁxed income/bonds, and alternative
investments).
