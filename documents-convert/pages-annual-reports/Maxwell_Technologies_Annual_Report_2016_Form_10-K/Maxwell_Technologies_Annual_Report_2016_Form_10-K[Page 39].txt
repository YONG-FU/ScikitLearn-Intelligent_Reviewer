Restructuring and Exit Costs
In 2015, we initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate US. manufacturing operations and to reduce headcount and operating expenses in order to align our
cost structure with the current business forecast and to improve operational efﬁciency. The plan also included the disposition of our microelectronics product line
which was completed in April 2016. The restructuring plan was otherwise substantially completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 20 16. Total restructuring and exit costs
were $2.8 million , which included $1.3 million in facilities costs related to the consolidation of manufacturing operations, $1.2 million in employee severance
costs and $0.3 million for equipment relocation and inventory scrap as a direct result of the deconstruction of machinery. Total cash expenditures related to
restructuring activities were approximately $1.5 million .
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded charges related to the restructuring plan of $0.3 million and $2.5 million , respectively.
The following table summarizes our restructuring and exit costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

Impairment of Assets
During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recorded total impairment charges of $1.4 million related to property and equipment. In the fourth quarter of
2016, we recorded $1.2 million of impairment charges related to machinery which was no longer forecasted to be utilized during its remaining useful life based on
the current production forecast and for which the fair value approximated zero. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2016, we recorded $0.2 million of
impairment charges related to the cancellation of a project. No impairments of property and equipment were recorded during the years ended December 31 2015
and 2014 .
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate differs from the statutory US federal income tax rate of 34% primarily due to foreign income taxes and the valuation allowance
against our domestic deferred tax assets.
We recorded an income tax provision of $4.1 million , $4.6 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
This provision is primarily related to taxes on income generated by our Swiss subsidiary. As of December 31, 2016 , we have recorded a $4.9 million deferred tax
liability for Swiss withholding taxes associated with $97.6 million of undistributed earnings of our Swiss subsidiary that are no longer considered indeﬁnitely
reinvested. In the event that we repatriate these funds, this withholding tax would become payable to the Swiss government. During the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014 , income tax expense associated with undistributed earnings of our Swiss subsidiary that are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested was
$1.2 million , $2.1 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
At December 31, 2016 , we have a cumulative valuation allowance recorded offsetting our worldwide net deferred tax assets of $78.4 million , of which the
significant majority represents the valuation allowance on our US net deferred tax assets. We have established a valuation allowance against our US. federal and
state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax
assets and at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that US deferred tax assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced
accordingly.
