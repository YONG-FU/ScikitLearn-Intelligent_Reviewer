Equity Incentive Plans
The Company has two active share-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2016 : the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and the 2013
Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”), as approved by the stockholders. Under the Incentive Plan, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock awards (“RSAS”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have been granted to employees and non-employee directors. Generally, these
awards vest over periods of one to four years. In addition, equity awards have been issued to senior management where vesting of the award is tied to Company
performance or market conditions. The Company’s policy is to issue new shares of its common stock upon the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock
units, granting of restricted stock awards or ESPP purchases.
The Company’s Incentive Plan currently provides for an equity incentive pool of 4,900,000 shares. Shares reserved for issuance are replenished by forfeited
shares from the Incentive Plan. Additionally, equity awards forfeited under the Company’s former 2005 equity incentive plan and shares that were available under
other predecessor plans are included in the total shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plan.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the tax benefit associated with stock option exercises, restricted stock unit vesting, restricted stock grants, and
disqualifying dispositions of both incentive stock options and stock issued under the Company’s ESPP, was approximately $1.7 million . No tax benefits were
recognized in the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 because excess tax benefits were not realized by the Company.
