Employees
As of December 31, 2016 , we had 418 employees in five countries, as follows: 224 full-time, 5 part-time and 31 temporary employees in the US; 82 full-
time, 9 part-time and 21 temporary employees in Switzerland; 32 full-time and 4 temporary employees in China; 9 full-time employees in Germany, and 1 full-time
employee in South Korea. We are unable to estimate the percent of our Swiss employees that are members of a labor union, as Swiss law prohibits employers from
inquiring into the union status of employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be amicable.
