The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2015 was $3.34 . No stock options were granted
during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 . The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014
was $0 , $16,000 and $0.6 million , respectively. There were no option exercises for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
The fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2015 was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model using the
following assumptions:
Year Ended
December 31,
2015
’Expected dividends —%1
Expected volatility range 60% to 61%
’Expected volatility weighted average 60%‘
Risk-free interest rate 1.6%
’Expected life/term weighted average (in years) 4.9 l
The expected dividend yield is zero because the Company has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends. The expected
term is based on the Company’s historical experience from previous stock option grants. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
stock measured over a period commensurate with the expected option term. The Company does not consider implied volatility due to the low volume of publicly
traded options in the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the zero coupon rate on US. Treasury instruments with a term comparable to the
option’s expected term.
As of December 31, 2016 , there was $0.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options. The cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 2.3 years .

Restricted Stock Units
Non-employee directors receive annual RSU awards, normally in February of each year, as partial consideration for their annual retainer compensation.
These awards vest in full one year from the date of grant provided the non-employee director provides continued service. Additionally, new directors normally
receive RSUs upon their election to the board. The Company also grants RSUs to employees as part of its annual equity incentive award program, with vesting
typically in equal annual installments over four years of continuous service. Additionally, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”)
to executives with vesting contingent on continued service and achievement of specified performance objectives or stock price performance. Each RSU represents
the right to receive one unrestricted share of the Company’s common stock upon vesting.
