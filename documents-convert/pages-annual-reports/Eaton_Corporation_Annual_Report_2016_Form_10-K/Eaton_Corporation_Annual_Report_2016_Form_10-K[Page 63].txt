Note 14. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY
Accounts Receivable
Eaton performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and maintains sufﬁcient allowances for potential credit losses.
The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on the length of time the receivable is past due and
any anticipated future write-off based on historic experience. Accounts receivable balances are written off against an allowance
for doubtful accounts after a ﬁnal determination of uncollectability has been made. Accounts receivable are net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts of $50 at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

ﬁrst-out (LIFO) method. Remaining United States and non-United States inventory is accounted for using the ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out
