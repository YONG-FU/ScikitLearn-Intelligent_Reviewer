LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION
Financial Condition and Liquidity
Eaton’s objective is to ﬁnance its business through operating cash ﬂow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and
short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk. The Company maintains access to the
commercial paper markets through a $2,000 commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, Eaton reﬁnanced a $750, ﬁve-
year revolving credit facility with a $750, ﬁve-year revolving credit facility that will expire October 14, 2021. Eaton also
maintains a $500, four-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 3, 2018 and a $750, ﬁve-year credit facility that
will expire October 3, 2019. This reﬁnancing maintains long-term revolving credit facilities at a total of $2,000. The revolving
credit facilities are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and
certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding
under Eaton's revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2016 or 2015. The Company had available lines of credit of $823 from
various banks primarily for the issuance of letters of credit, of which there was $285 outstanding at December 31, 2016. Over
the course of a year, cash, short-term investments and short-term debt may ﬂuctuate in order to manage global liquidity. Eaton
believes it has the operating ﬂexibility, cash ﬂow, cash and short-term investment balances, and access to capital markets in
excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business as well as scheduled payments of long-term
debt.
On September 20, 2016, a subsidiary of Baton issued Euro denominated notes (Euro Notes) with a face value of €5 50 ($615
based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate), in accordance with Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. The Euro Notes mature in 2024 with interest payable annually at a rate of 0.75%. After ﬁnancing costs and discounts,
the issuer received proceeds totaling €544 ($609 based on the September 20, 2016 spot rate) from the issuance.
For additional information on ﬁnancing transactions and debt, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Eaton’s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which
would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related
outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton’s present credit rating level, the most restrictive ﬁnancial covenant
provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated
net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as deﬁned in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not
exceed 10%. Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton is in compliance with each
of its debt covenants for all periods presented.
Sources and Uses of Cash
Operating Cash Flow
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,552 in 2016, an increase of $181 compared to $2,371 in 2015. The
increase was driven by lower pension contributions and lower working capital balances compared to 2015.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,371 in 2015, an increase of $493 compared to $1,878 in 2014. The
increase was primarily due to payments totaling $654 for the Meritor, Triumph and related litigation in the third quarter of
2014.
For additional information on litigation settlements, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Investing Cash Flow
Net cash used in investing activities was $529 in 2016, a decrease in the use of cash of $46 compared to $575 in 2015. The
decrease in 2016 was primarily driven by no business acquisitions completed in 2016 and lower capital expenditures in 2016
compared to 2015, partially offset by purchases of short-term investments of $40 in 2016 compared to sales of $37 in 2015.
Capital expenditures were $497 in 2016 compared to $506 in 2015. Eaton expects approximately $525 in capital expenditures
in 2017.
Net cash used in investing activities was $57 5 in 2015, a decrease of $718 compared to net cash provided by investing
activities of $143 in 2014. The decrease in 2015 was principally due to fewer net proceeds from short-term investments of $37
in 2015 compared to $522 in 2014, and proceeds from the sale of business of $282 in 2014. Capital expenditures were $506 in
2015 compared to $632 in 2014.
Financing Cash Flow
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was $1,720 in 2016, a decrease in the use of cash of $547 compared to $2,267 in 2015.
The decrease in the use of cash was primarily due to lower payments on borrowings of $653 in 2016 compared to $1,027 in
2015 and higher proceeds from borrowings of $631 in 2016 compared to $425 in 2015, partially offset by higher share
repurchases of $730 in 2016 compared to $682 in 2015.
