The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The principal
assumptions utilized in valuing stock options include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent historical
period equal to the expected life of the option); the expected option life (an estimate based on historical experience); the
expected dividend yield; and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon
with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option). A summary of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of
stock options follows:
2016 2015 2014
[Expected volatility 27% 29% 34%[
Expected option life in years 5.5 5.5 5.5
[Expected dividend yield 2.5% 2.6% 2.4%[
Risk-free interest rate 1.2 to 1.5% 1.6 to 1.5% 1.7 to 1.5%
[Weighted-average fair value of stock options granted $ 11.80 $ 15.25 $ 19.46 [

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total excess of the $67.09 closing price of Eaton ordinary
shares on the last trading day of 2016 over the exercise price of the stock option, multiplied by the related number of options
outstanding and exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value is not recognized for financial accounting purposes and the value
changes based on the daily changes in the fair market value of the Company's ordinary shares.
