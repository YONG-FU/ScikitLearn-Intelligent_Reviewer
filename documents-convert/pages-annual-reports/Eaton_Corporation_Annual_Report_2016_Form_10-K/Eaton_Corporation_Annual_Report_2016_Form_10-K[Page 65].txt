For purposes of business segment performance measurement, the Company does not allocate items that are of a non-
operating nature or are of a corporate or functional governance nature. Corporate expenses consist of transaction costs
associated with the acquisition of certain businesses and corporate ofﬁce expenses including compensation, beneﬁts,
occupancy, depreciation, and other administrative costs. Identiﬁable assets of the business segments exclude goodwill, other
intangible assets, and general corporate assets, which principally consist of certain cash, short-term investments, deferred
income taxes, certain accounts receivable, certain property, plant and equipment, and certain other assets.
