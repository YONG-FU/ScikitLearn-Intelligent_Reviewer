The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examination of Eaton Corporation and Includible
Subsidiaries’ United States income tax returns for 2005 through 2010 and has issued Statutory Notices of Deﬁciency (Notices)
as discussed below. The statute of limitations on these tax years remains open until the matters are resolved. The IRS is
currently examining tax years 2011 through 2013. The statute of limitations for tax years 2011 through 2013 is open until April
30, 2018. Tax years 2014 and 2015 are still subject to examination by the IRS.
With respect to the BZ Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries (the former US. holding company for Cooper Industries) ﬁnal return
period ended December 21, 2012, the statute of limitations closed on September 15, 2016. On December 22, 2012, BZ
Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries joined the Eaton US Holdings Inc. and Includible Subsidiaries consolidated United States
income tax return for 2012.
Eaton is also under examination for the income tax ﬁlings in various states and localities of the United States. With only a
few exceptions, Eaton Corporation and Includible Subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax examinations from states
and localities within the United States for years before 2012. Income tax returns of states and localities within the United States
will be reopened to the extent of United States federal income tax adjustments, if any, going back to 2005 when those audit
years are ﬁnalized. Some states and localities may not limit their assessment to the United States federal adjustments, and may
require the opening of the entire tax year. In addition, with only a few exceptions, BZ Holdings Inc. and Includible Subsidiaries
are no longer subject to United States state and local income tax examinations for years before 2012.
In 2011, the IRS issued a Notice for Eaton Corporation and Includible Subsidiaries for the 2005 and 2006 tax years (the
2011 Notice). The 2011 Notice proposed assessments of $75 in additional taxes plus $52 in penalties related primarily to
transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic
and sold to afﬁliated companies located in the US, net of agreed credits and deductions. The Company has set its transfer
prices for products sold between these afﬁliates at the same prices that the Company sells such products to third parties as
required by two successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) the Company entered into with the IRS. For the years 2001
through 2004, the IRS had previously accepted the transfer pricing methodology related to these APAs after a comprehensive
review conducted in two separate audit cycles. Immediately prior to the 2011 Notice being issued, the IRS sent a letter stating
that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs, even though their respective APA terms had already expired.
The Company is contesting the proposed assessments. The Company believes that it was in full compliance with the terms
of the two APAs, and that the IRS's cancellation of these two APAs is without merit. On February 29, 2012, the Company ﬁled
a Petition with the US. Tax Court in which it asserted that the transfer pricing established in the APAs meets the arms-length
standard set by the US. income tax laws, and accordingly, that the APAs should be enforced in accordance with their terms.
The case involves both whether the APAs should be enforced and, if not, the appropriate transfer pricing methodology. The Tax
Court’s decision in the case is now pending following a trial in 2015 and the completion of the parties’ brieﬁng in 2016.
In 2014, the Company received a Notice from the IRS for the 2007 through 2010 tax years (the 2014 Notice) proposing
assessments of $190 in additional taxes plus $72 in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments
pertain primarily to the same transfer pricing issues for which the Tax Court’s decision is pending, as noted above. During 2007
through 2010, the Company set its transfer prices for products sold between its afﬁliates consistent with the terms of a written
APA between it and the IRS that covered the years at issue. To establish the relevant transfer prices, the APA relied on prices at
which the Company sells the products to third parties. The Company has continued to apply the arms-length transfer pricing
methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. The 2014 Notice includes a separate proposed assessment involving
the recognition of income for several of the Company’s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that all
proposed assessments are without merit. On November 25, 2014, the Company ﬁled a Petition with the US. Tax Court in
which it challenged the IRS's adjustments. The Company expects the outcome of the 2014 Notice on the transfer pricing matter
to be determined by the judicial decision related to the 2011 Notice. In 2016, litigation activities commenced for the separate
issue in the 2014 Notice regarding recognition of income for several of the Company’s controlled foreign corporations.
In 2014 and 2016, the Company resolved uncertain tax positions with a European government. The resolutions had minimal
impact on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income in each respective year.
