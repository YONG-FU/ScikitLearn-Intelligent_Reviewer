Total Corporate expense decreased 16% in 2016 to $831 from $988 in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in pension and other
postretirement beneﬁts expense, and income from several insurance matters of $64 during the fourth quarter of 2016. The
decrease in pension and other postretirement beneﬁts expense is resulting from a change to the spot rate approach for
measuring service and interest costs, higher discount rates and updated mortality tables. Total corporate expense decreased 36%
in 2015 to $988 from $1,551 in 2014 primarily due to litigation settlements of $644 during the second quarter of 2014, partially
offset by a gain of $154 on the divestiture of Eaton's Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated
Cockpit Solutions businesses during the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the litigation settlement and gain on the divestiture
of the business, total corporate expenses-net decreased 7% in 2015 due to savings from cost control measures.
