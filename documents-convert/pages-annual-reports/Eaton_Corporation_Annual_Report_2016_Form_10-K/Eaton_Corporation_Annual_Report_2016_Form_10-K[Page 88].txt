FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report to Shareholders contains forward-looking statements concerning litigation and regulatory
developments, expected pension or other post-retirement beneﬁt payments, capital expenditures and the costs and beneﬁts of
restructuring actions, among other matters. These statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future trends,
plans, events, results of operations or ﬁnancial condition, or state other information relating to Eaton, based on current beliefs
of management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Forward-looking

“guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project” or other similar words, phrases or expressions. These
statements should be used with caution and are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside Eaton’s
control. The following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements:
unanticipated changes in the markets for the Company’s business segments; unanticipated downturns in business relationships
with customers or their purchases from us; the availability of credit to customers and suppliers; competitive pressures on sales
and pricing; unanticipated changes in the cost of material and other production costs, or unexpected costs that cannot be
recouped in product pricing; the introduction of competing technologies; unexpected technical or marketing difﬁculties;
unexpected claims, charges, litigation or dispute resolutions; strikes or other labor unrest; the impact of acquisitions and
divestitures; unanticipated difﬁculties integrating acquisitions; new laws and governmental regulations; interest rate changes;
tax rate changes or exposure to additional income tax liability; stock market and currency ﬂuctuations; war, civil or political
