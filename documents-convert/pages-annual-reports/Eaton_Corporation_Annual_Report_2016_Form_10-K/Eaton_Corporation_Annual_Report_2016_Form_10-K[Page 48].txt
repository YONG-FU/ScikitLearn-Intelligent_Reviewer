During 2016, income tax expense of $202 was recognized (an effective tax rate of 9.5%) compared to income tax expense
of $164 for 2015 (an effective tax rate of 7.7%) and income tax beneﬁt of $42 for 2014 (an effective tax beneﬁt rate of 2.4%).
The 2016 effective tax rate increased from 2015 primarily due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions,
partially offset by net decreases in worldwide tax liabilities. In 2014, excluding the net tax beneﬁt of 7.6% for the Meritor and
Triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the Aerospace businesses, the effective tax rate
was 5.2%. The 2015 effective tax rate increased from 2014 due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions
and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities.
See Note 8 and Note 2 for additional information about litigation settlements and sales of businesses, respectively.
No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $17.3
billion at December 31, 2016, since it is the Company's intention to indeﬁnitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable
on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.
The Company expects to deploy capital to those markets which offer particularly attractive growth opportunities. Given
expected population growth and economic growth rates, most of the particularly attractive markets are outside of the United
States. The cash that is permanently reinvested is typically used to expand these operations either organically or through
acquisitions. In addition, the Company expects that minimal to no Irish tax would apply to dividends paid to the Irish parent due
to the impact of the Irish foreign tax credit system. The Company's public dividends and share repurchases are funded primarily
from Non-US. operations.
