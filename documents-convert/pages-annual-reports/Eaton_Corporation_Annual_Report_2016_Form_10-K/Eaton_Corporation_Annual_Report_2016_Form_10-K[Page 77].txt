Net Sales
Net sales in 2016 decreased by 5% compared to 2015 due to a decrease of 4% in organic sales and decrease of 1% from the
impact of negative currency translation. Net sales in 2015 decreased by 8% compared to 2014 due to a decrease of 6% from the
impact of negative currency translation and a decrease of 2% in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales in 2016 and 2015
was primarily due to weakening demand in several of the Company's end markets.
Gross Proﬁt
Gross proﬁt margin increased from 31.5% in 2015 to 32.1% in 2016. The increase in gross proﬁt margin in 2016 was
primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and other cost control measures, partially offset by lower sales volumes,
unfavorable product mix, and higher restructuring charges. Gross profit increased from 30.6% in 2014 to 31.5% in 2015. The
increase in gross profit margin in 2015 was primarily due to cost savings from restructuring actions taken in the second half of
2015 and other cost control measures, partially offset by restructuring charges incurred in 2015.
Income Taxes
During 2016, an income tax expense of $202 was recognized (an effective tax rate of 9.5%) compared to income tax
expense of $164 in 2015 (an effective tax rate of 7.7%). The 2016 effective tax rate increased from 2015 primarily due to
greater levels of income earned in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by net decreases in worldwide tax liabilities.
During 2015, an income tax expense of $164 was recognized (an effective tax rate of 7.7%) compared to income tax benefit
of $42 for 2014 (an effective tax beneﬁt rate of 2.4%). In 2014, excluding the net tax beneﬁt of 7.6% for the Meritor and
Triumph litigation settlements and related legal costs and the gain on the sale of the Aerospace businesses, the effective tax rate
was 5.2%. The 2015 effective tax rate increased from 2014 primarily due to greater levels of income earned in higher tax
jurisdictions and net increases in worldwide tax liabilities.
