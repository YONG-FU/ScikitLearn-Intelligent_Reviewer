Note 16. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On November 14, 2013, Eaton Corporation registered senior notes under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Senior Notes).
Eaton and certain other of Eaton's 100% owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (the Guarantors) fully and unconditionally
guaranteed (subject, in the case of the Guarantors, other than Eaton, to customary release provisions as described below), on a
joint and several basis, the Senior Notes. The following condensed consolidating ﬁnancial statements are included so that
separate ﬁnancial statements of Eaton, Eaton Corporation and each of the Guarantors are not required to be ﬁled with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidating adjustments primarily relate to eliminations of investments in
subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. The condensed consolidating ﬁnancial statements present investments
in subsidiaries using the equity method of accounting. See Note 6 for additional information related to the Senior Notes.
The guarantee of a Guarantor that is not a parent of the issuer will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged in the event of any sale of the Guarantor or of all or substantially all of its assets, or in connection with the release or
termination of the Guarantor as a guarantor under all other US. debt securities or US. syndicated credit facilities, subject to
limitations set forth in the indenture. The guarantee of a Guarantor that is a direct or indirect parent of the issuer will only be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged in connection with the release or termination of such Guarantor as a
guarantor under all other debt securities or syndicated credit facilities (in both cases, US. or otherwise), subject to limitations
set forth in the indenture.
During 2016 and 2015, the Company undertook certain steps to restructure ownership of various subsidiaries. The
transactions were entirely among wholly-owned subsidiaries under the common control of Eaton. This restructuring has been
reﬂected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented below.
