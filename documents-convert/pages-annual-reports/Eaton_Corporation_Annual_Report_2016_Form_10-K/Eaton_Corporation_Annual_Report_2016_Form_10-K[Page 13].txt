Irish Taxes Applicable to Dividends
In certain circumstances, Eaton will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from
dividends paid to its shareholders. In the majority of cases, however, shareholders resident in the US. will not be subject to
Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax
provided that they complete certain Irish tax forms. Effective January 1, 2018, shareholders that reside in the US who hold their
shares outside of a Depository Trust Company will be subject to Irish withholding tax on dividends unless they complete
certain Irish tax forms.
Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Eaton shares. Dividends paid in respect of Eaton shares
will generally not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneﬁcial owner of these shares is exempt from dividend
withholding tax, unless the beneﬁcial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her
shareholding in Eaton.
Eaton shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability
to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneﬁcial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his
or her shareholding in Eaton.
