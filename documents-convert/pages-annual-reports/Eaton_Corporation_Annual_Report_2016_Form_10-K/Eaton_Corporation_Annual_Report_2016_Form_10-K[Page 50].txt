Recoverability of Deferred Income Tax Assets
Eaton is subject to the income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In order to determine its income tax
provision for financial statement purposes, Eaton must make significant estimates and judgments about its business operations
in these jurisdictions. These estimates and judgments are also used in determining the deferred income tax assets and liabilities
that have been recognized for differences between the Ô¨Ånancial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, and
income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards.
