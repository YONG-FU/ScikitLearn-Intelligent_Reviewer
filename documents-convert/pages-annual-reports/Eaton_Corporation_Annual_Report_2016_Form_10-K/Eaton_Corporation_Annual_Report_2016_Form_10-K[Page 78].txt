Net Income
Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders of $1,922 in 2016 decreased 3% compared to $1,979 in 2015. The
decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower sales volumes, unfavorable product mix, and higher restructuring charges, partially
offset by savings from restructuring actions, other cost control measures, a decrease in pension and other postretirement
beneﬁts expense, and income from several insurance matters of $68 during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable
to Eaton ordinary shareholders of $1,979 in 2015 increased 10% compared to Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary
shareholders of $1,793 in 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to lower income in the second quarter of 2014 as a
result of settlement of the Meritor and Triumph litigation matters for $500 and $147.5, respectively, partially offset by the
impact of the sale of the Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and Integrated Cockpit Solutions businesses.
Excluding litigation settlements and gain on sale, net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders declined in 2015 due
to lower sales volume, the negative impact of currency translation, a higher tax rate, and higher restructuring charges incurred
in 2015, offset by savings resulting from the 2015 restructuring actions and other cost control measures.
Operating Earnings
Operating earnings of $1,925 in 2016 decreased 4% compared to Operating earnings of $2,010 in 2015. The decrease was
due to lower Net income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders and lower acquisition integration charges. Operating
earnings of $2,010 in 2015 increased 6% compared to 2014 Operating earnings of $1,895. The increase was due to higher Net
income attributable to Eaton ordinary shareholders, partially offset by lower acquisition integration charges.
Operating earnings per ordinary share decreased by 2% to $4.22 in 2016 compared to $4.30 in 2015. The decrease in
Operating earnings per ordinary share in 2016 was due to lower Operating earnings, partially offset by the impact of the
Company's share repurchases in 2016. Operating earnings per ordinary share of $4.30 in 2015 increased 8% from $3.97 in
2014. The increase in Operating earnings per ordinary share in 2015 was due to higher Operating earnings and the impact of the
Company's share repurchases in 2015.
