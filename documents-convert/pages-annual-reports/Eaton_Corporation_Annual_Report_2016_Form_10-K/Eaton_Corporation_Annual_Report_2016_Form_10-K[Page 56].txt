Note 11. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
Restricted Stock Units and Awards
Restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAS) have been issued to certain employees and
directors. Participants awarded RSUs do not receive dividends; therefore, the fair value is determined by reducing the closing
market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant by the present value of the estimated dividends had they
been paid. The RSUs entitle the holder to receive one ordinary share for each RSU upon vesting, generally over three years.
The fair value of RSAS is determined based on the closing market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the date of grant.
RSAS are issued and outstanding at the time of grant, but remain subject to forfeiture until vested, generally over three or four
years. A summary of the RSU and RSA activity for 2016 follows:
Number of restricted Weighted-average fair
(Restricted stock units and awards in millions) 7 stock units and awards 7 value per unit and award 7
[Non-vested at January 1 2.1 $ 65.06 J

[ Vested (0.9) 64.11 ]
Forfeited 7 (0.2), 7 59.89 7
[Non-vested at December 31 r 2.6 : :$ 57.87 I
Information related to RSUs and RSAS follows:

[Pretax expense for RSUs and RSAS $ 65 $ 68 $ 81 J
After-tax expense for RSUs and RSAS 42 44 53
[Fair value of vested RSUs and RSAS 71 110 105 ]
As of December 31, 2016, total compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested RSUs and RSAS was $87,
and the weighted—average period in which the expense is expected to be recognized is 2.5 years. Excess tax beneﬁt for RSUs
and RSAS totaled $5 for 2014. There was no excess tax beneﬁt for RSUs and RSAS in 2016 and 2015.
Performance Share Units
In February 2016, the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors approved the grant of
performance share units (PSUs) to certain employees that vest based on the satisfaction of a three-year service period and total
shareholder return relative to that of a group of peers. Awards earned at the end of the three-year vesting period range from 0%
to 200% of the targeted number of PSUs granted based on the ranking of total shareholder return of the Company, assuming
reinvestment of all dividends, relative to a defined peer group of companies. Equity-based compensation expense for these
PSUs is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Upon
vesting, dividends that have accumulated during the vesting period are paid on earned awards.
The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of PSUs with market conditions. The principal
assumptions utilized in valuing these PSUs include the expected stock price volatility (based on the most recent 3-year period
as of the grant date) and the risk-free interest rate (an estimate based on the yield of United States Treasury zero coupon bonds
with a 3-year maturity as of the grant date). A summary of the assumptions used in determining fair value of these PSUS
follows:
7 2016 7
[Expected volatility 24%}
Risk-free interest rate 0.88%
[Weighted-average fair value of PSUs granted $ 76.41 ]
