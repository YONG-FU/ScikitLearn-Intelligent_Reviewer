Note 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should
be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for
considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in
active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
A summary of ﬁnancial instruments recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, follows:

Eaton values its ﬁnancial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant
information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. No ﬁnancial instruments
were measured using unobservable inputs.
Other Fair Value Measurements
Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of $8,263 and fair value of $8,477 at
December 31, 2016 compared to $7,988 and $8,231, respectively, at December 31, 2015. The fair value of Eaton's debt
instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and
is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Short-Term Investments
Eaton invests excess cash generated from operations in short-term marketable investments. For those investments classiﬁed
as “available-for—sale”, Eaton marks these investments to fair value with the offset recognized in Accumulated other
comprehensive loss. A summary of the carrying value of short-term investments follows:
