Net sales in 2016 decreased 10% compared to 2015 due to a decrease in organic sales of 9% and a decrease of 1% from the
impact of negative currency translation. The decrease in organic sales was due to continued weakness in both the mobile and
industrial markets. Net sales in 2015 decreased 17% compared to 2014 due to a decrease in organic sales of 10% and a decrease
of 7% from the impact of negative currency translation. The decrease in organic sales was due to broad weakness in global
hydraulics markets.
Operating margin decreased from 10.0% in 2015 to 8.9% in 2016. The decrease in operating margin in 2016 was primarily
due to lower sales volumes and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and other cost
control measures. Operating margin decreased from 12.3% in 2014 to 10.0% in 2015. The decrease in operating margin during
2015 was primarily due to lower sales volumes and restructuring charges incurred in 2015, partially offset by savings from
2015 restructuring actions, other cost control measures, and efﬁciencies generated from certain restructuring activities taken in
2014.
Operating margin before acquisition integration charges decreased from 10.1% in 2015 to 8.9% in 2016. The decrease in
operating margin before acquisition integration charges was primarily due to lower operating margins. Operating margin before
acquisition integration charges decreased from 12.7% in 2014 to 10.1% in 2015. The decrease in operating margin before
acquisition integration charges in 2015 was primarily due to lower operating margins and lower acquisition integration charges.

Net sales in 2016 decreased 3% compared to 2015 due to a decrease of 2% from the impact of negative currency translation
and a decrease in organic sales of 1%. The decrease in organic sales during 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in military
OEM markets and lower cost reimbursements on certain engineering programs, partially offset by growth in commercial
markets. Net sales in 2015 decreased 3% compared to 2014 due to a decrease of 2% from the impact of negative currency
translation and a decrease of 2% from the divestiture of Eaton's Aerospace Power Distribution Management Solutions and
Integrated Cockpit Solutions business in the second quarter of 2014, offset by a 1% increase in organic sales. The increase in
organic sales during 2015 was related to higher aftermarket sales and strength in commercial OEM markets, offset by a
weakness in military OEM markets.
Operating margin increased from 17.2% in 2015 to 19.1% in 2016. The increase was primarily due to savings from
restructuring actions, other cost control measures and reduced program development spending. Operating margin increased
from 14.7% in 2014 to 17.2% in 2015. The increase was primarily due to favorable product miX, savings from restructuring
actions and other cost control measures, partially offset by restructuring charges incurred in 2015.
