The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts
entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany sales and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge
accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing 100% of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to
minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations.
This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts.
