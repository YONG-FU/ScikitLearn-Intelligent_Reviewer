Eaton also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of the Company’s ﬁnancial
liabilities would change as a result of movements in interest rates. Based on Eaton’s best estimate for a hypothetical, 100 basis
point decrease in interest rates at December 31, 2016, the market value of the Company’s debt and interest rate swap portfolio,
in aggregate, would increase by $435.
The Company is exposed to currency risk associated with translating its functional currency financial statements into its
reporting currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various
currencies against the US. dollar. Eaton also monitors exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of each country in which the Company operates, and regularly enters into forward contracts to mitigate that
exposure. In the aggregate, Eaton’s portfolio of forward contracts related to such transactions was not material to its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(1)Long—term debt excludes deferred gains and losses on derivatives related to debt, adjustments to fair market value, and premiums and
discounts on long-term debentures.
Interest expense related to long-term debt is based on the ﬁxed interest rate, or other applicable interest rate, related to the
debt instrument. The reduction of interest expense due to interest rate swap agreements related to long-term debt is based on the
difference in the fixed interest rate the Company receives from the swap, compared to the ﬂoating interest rate the Company
pays on the swap. Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business. These amounts
include commitments for purchases of raw materials, outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders, releases under blanket
purchase orders, and commitments under ongoing service arrangements. Other long-term obligations principally include
anticipated contributions of $215 to pension plans in 2017 and $58 of deferred compensation earned under various plans for
which the participants have elected to receive disbursement at a later date.
The table above does not include future expected pension benefit payments or expected other postretirement benefits
payments. Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits, since the Company cannot predict
with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. At December 31, 2016, the gross
liability for unrecognized income tax benefits totaled $629 and interest and penalties were $94.
