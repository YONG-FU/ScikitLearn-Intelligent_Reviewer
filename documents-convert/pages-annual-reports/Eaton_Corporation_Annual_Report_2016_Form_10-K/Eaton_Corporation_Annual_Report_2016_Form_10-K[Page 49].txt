In July 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Beneﬁt
When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11
requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in
settlement of the uncertain tax positions except where the deferred tax asset or other carryforward are not available for use. The
adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction of the Company’s consolidated long term deferred tax assets by $331 in 2016
and $262 in 2015.
At December 31, 2016, certain Irish and non-United States subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit
