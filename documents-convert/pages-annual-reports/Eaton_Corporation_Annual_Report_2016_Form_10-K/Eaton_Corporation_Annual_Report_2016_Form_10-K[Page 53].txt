During 2010, the Company received a tax assessment of $51 (translated at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate), plus
interest and penalties, in Brazil for the tax years 2005 through 2008 that relates to the amortization of certain goodwill
generated from the acquisition of third-party businesses and corporate reorganizations. The Company is contesting the
assessment, which is under review at the second of three administrative appeals levels. During 2013, the Brazilian tax
authorities began an audit of tax years 2009 through 2012. During 2014, the Company received a tax assessment of $39
(translated at the December 31, 2016 exchange rate), plus interest and penalties, for the 2009 through 2012 tax years (primarily
relating to the same issues concerning the 2005 through 2008 tax years), which the Company is also contesting and is under
review in the second of three administrative appeals levels. Multiple outside advisors have stated that Brazilian tax authorities
are raising the issue for most clients with similar facts and that the matter is expected to require at least 10 years to resolve. The
Company continues to believe that ﬁnal resolution of the assessments will not have a material impact on its consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
