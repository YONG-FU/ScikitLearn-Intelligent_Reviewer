In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Compensation-
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (ASU 2016-09). The
standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income
tax impact, classiﬁcation on the statement of cash ﬂows and forfeitures. The new standard eliminates the accounting for excess
tax beneﬁts to be recognized in equity, and tax deﬁciencies recognized in either equity or the income tax provision. ASU
2016-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt the
new standard in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recognizing deferred tax assets for all excess
tax beneﬁts that had not been previously recognized. This will be accomplished through a cumulative-effect adjustment to
retained earnings and is not expected to have a material impact to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
