Note 9. INCOME TAXES
Eaton Corporation plc is domiciled in Ireland. Income (loss) before income taxes and income tax (beneﬁt) expense are
summarized below based on the geographic location of the operation to which such earnings and income taxes are attributable.
Certain Eaton operations which are located outside the United States are subject to income tax in both the United States as well
as the country in which the operations are located. As a result, income before tax by location and the components of income tax
expense by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.
