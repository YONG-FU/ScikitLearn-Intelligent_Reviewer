Retirement Beneﬁts Plans Assumptions
For purposes of determining liabilities related to pension plans and other postretirement beneﬁts plans in the United States,
the Company updated its mortality assumption in 2014 to use the RP-2014 tables with a generational improvement scale based
on NIP-2014. In 2015, the Company updated its mortality assumption to use 2014 tables and a generational improvement scale
that are based on MP-2015. In 2016, the Company updated its mortality assumption to use 2014 tables and a generational
improvement scale that are based on MP-2016.
In 2016, the Company adopted a change in the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost components of net
periodic beneﬁt cost for its deﬁned beneﬁt pension and other postretirement beneﬁt plans. Prior to 2016, for the vast majority
of its plans, the service and interest cost components were estimated using a single weighted-average discount rate derived
from the yield curve used to measure the beneﬁt obligation at the beginning of the period. Beginning in 2016, the Company
used a spot rate approach by applying the speciﬁc spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash ﬂows in the
estimation of the service and interest components of beneﬁt cost, resulting in a more precise measurement. This change does
not affect the measurement of total beneﬁt obligations. The change was accounted for as a change in estimate and, accordingly,
was accounted for prospectively starting in 2016. The reductions in service cost and interest cost for 2016 associated with this
change in estimate were $3 and $42, respectively.

The expected long-term rate of return on pension assets was determined for each country and reﬂects long-term historical
data taking into account each plan's target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return on pension assets for United
States pension plans and Non-United States pension plans for 2017 are 7.90% and 6.30%, respectively. The discount rates were
determined using appropriate bond data for each country.
