slots on Juhuasuan may only be purchased by Taobao Marketplace and Tmall merchants, and transactions
from traffic originating on Juhuasuan are completed on the merchants’ storefronts on Taobao Marketplace
or Tmall. For this reason, depending on the context, we may refer only to Taobao Marketplace and Tmall
when discussing certain aspects of our China retail marketplaces business;
° “GMV” are to the value of confirmed orders of products and services on our marketplaces, regardless of
how, or whether, the buyer and seller settle the transaction. Unless otherwise stated, GMV in reference to
our marketplaces includes only GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces. GMV generated from
traffic through Juhuasuan is recorded as either Taobao Marketplace GMV or T mall GMV depending on
which of these two marketplaces the transaction is completed. Our calculation of GMV for our China retail
marketplaces includes shipping charges paid by buyers to sellers. As a prudential matter aimed at
eliminating any inﬂuence on our GMV of potentially fraudulent transactions, we exclude from our
calculation of GMV transactions in certain product categories over certain amounts and transactions by
buyers in certain product categories over a certain amount per day. The translation of annual GMV in
RMB for the year ended March 31, 2016 into US. dollar amount represents the sum of GMV in
