Regulation of Foreign Exchange and Dividend Distribution
Foreign Exchange Regulation
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Regulations on Foreign
Exchange Administration of the PRC. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account
items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in
foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By
contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be
converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of
foreign currency-denominated loans or foreign currency is to be remitted into China under the capital account,
such as a capital increase or foreign currency loans to our PRC subsidiaries.
In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of
the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or
SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital
into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 45 on
November 9, 2011 in order to clarify the application of SAFE Circular 142. Under SAFE Circular 142 and
Circular 45, the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise
may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may
not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the ﬂow and
use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use
of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be
used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used.
