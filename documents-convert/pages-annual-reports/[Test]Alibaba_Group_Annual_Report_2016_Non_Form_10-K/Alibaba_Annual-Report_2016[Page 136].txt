(US$174 million) in fiscal year 2016, compared to RMB1,667 million in fiscal year 2015. Such decrease in income
recognized primarily resulted from increased marketing and promotion activities of Ant Financial Services to drive
its user growth and engagement, causing a decrease in its consolidated pre-tax income.
Income Tax Expenses
Our income tax expenses increased by 32% from RMB6,416 million in fiscal year 2015 to RMB8,449 million
(US$1,310 million) in fiscal year 2016. The increase in income tax expenses was primarily due to the increase in
taxable income from our operations in China. Our effective tax rate decreased to 10% in fiscal year 2016 from
20% in fiscal year 2015, primarily due to the non-cash gains relating to the deconsolidation of Alibaba Pictures and
consolidation of Alibaba Health, as discussed in “Interest and Investment Income, Net” above, which are not
taxable for income tax purposes. Excluding the above gains and other non-taxable or non-deductible items, our
effective tax rate remains stable.
Share of Results of Equity Investees
Share of losses of equity investees in fiscal year 2016 was RMB1,730 million (US$269 million), an increase of
9% compared to RMB1,590 million in fiscal year 2015. Share of results of equity investee in fiscal year 2016
consisted of the following:

The increase in share of losses of equity investees in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was
primarily due to our share of losses of Koubei, Youku Tudou and Cainiao Network, partially offset by accounting
gains related to dilution of our ownership interest in Cainiao Network and Evergrande PC, as these investees each
raised capital at a higher valuation in fiscal year 2016. We established Koubei as a joint venture with Ant Financial
Services in September 2015. Our share of Koubei’s loss in fiscal year 2016 represents Koubei’s high investments
and promotional spending during its start-up stage. We expect such share of loss to decrease in the future.
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing, our net income increased by 193% from RMB24,320 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB71,289 million (US$11,056 million) in fiscal year 2016.
