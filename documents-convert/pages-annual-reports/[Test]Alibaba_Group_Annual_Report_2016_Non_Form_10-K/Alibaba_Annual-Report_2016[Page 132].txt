Revenue from our international commerce retail business increased by 25% from RMB1,768 million in fiscal
year 2015 to RMB2,204 million (US$342 million) in fiscal year 2016. The main reason for this increase was an
increase in GMV transacted on AliEXpress, primarily due to the increasing number of consumers, particularly in
Russia, Spain, the United States and France.
Revenue from our international commerce wholesale business increased by 15 % from RMB4,718 million in
fiscal year 2015, of which 69% was from membership fees and online marketing services and 31% was from value-
added services, to RMB5,425 million (US$841 million) in fiscal year 2016, of which 67% was from membership
fees and online marketing services and 33% was from value-added services. The increase in revenue was due to
growth in revenue generated by the import/export related services provided by One Touch and, to a lesser extent,
an increase in online marketing service revenue from China wholesale suppliers.
