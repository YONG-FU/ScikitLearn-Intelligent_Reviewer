severance pay in the amount mandated by law when his or her employment is terminated. We have been advised
by our PRC counsel, Fangda Partners, that we may be required to make such severance payments upon
termination without cause to comply with the PRC Labor Law, the labor contract law and other relevant PRC
regulations, which entitle employees to severance payments in case of early termination of “de facto employment
relationships” by PRC entities without statutory cause regardless of whether there exists a written employment
agreement with such entities.
Our grant letter agreements under our equity incentive plans also contain, among other rights, restrictive
covenants that enable us to terminate grants and repurchase shares at par or the exercise price paid for such
shares in the event of a grantee’s termination for cause for breaching such covenants. See “— Equity Incentive
Plans” below.
Equity Incentive Plans
We have adopted the following equity incentive plans since our inception:
0 1999 Share Option Plan, or the 1999 Plan;
0 2004 Share Option Plan, or the 2004 Plan;
0 2005 Share Option Plan, or the 2005 Plan;
0 2007 Share Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan;
0 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan; and
0 2014 Post—IPO Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2014 Plan.
Currently, awards are only available for issuance under our 2014 Plan. If an award under the 2011 Plan
terminates, expires or lapses, or is cancelled for any reason, ordinary shares subject to the award become available
for the grant of a new award under the 2014 Plan. As of March 31, 2016, there were:
0 15,108,078 ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and 2,699,250 issued but unvested
restricted shares;
° 78,005,100 ordinary shares subject to unvested RSUs; and
0 23,050,439 ordinary shares authorized for issuance under the 2014 Plan; plus, on April 1, 2015 and each
anniversary thereof, an additional amount equal to the lesser of (A) 25,000,000 ordinary shares and (B) such
lesser number of ordinary shares determined by our board of directors.
Our equity incentive plans provide for the granting of incentive and non-statutory options, restricted shares,
RSUs, dividend equivalents, share appreciation rights and share payments to any directors, employees, and
consultants of ours, our affiliates and certain other companies, such as Alipay. Share options and RSUs granted
are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the administrator of the respective plans.
Depending on the nature and the purpose of the grant, share options and RSUs in general vest 25% upon the first
anniversary of the vesting commencement date for annual incentive awards or 50% upon the second anniversary of
the vesting commencement date for on-hire awards, and thereafter 25 % every year. Starting in fiscal year 2015,
certain RSUs and share options granted to our senior management members were subject to a six-year pro rata
vesting schedule. We believe equity-based awards are vital to attract, motivate and retain our directors, employees
and consultants, and those of certain of our affiliates and other companies, such as Alipay, and are the appropriate
tool to align their interests with our shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to grant equity-based awards to
the employees, consultants and directors of our company, our affiliates and certain other companies as an
important part of their compensation packages.
In addition, our equity incentive award agreements generally provide that, in the event of a grantee’s
termination for cause or violation of a non-competition undertaking, we will have the right to repurchase the
shares acquired by such grantee, generally at par or the exercise price paid for such shares.
