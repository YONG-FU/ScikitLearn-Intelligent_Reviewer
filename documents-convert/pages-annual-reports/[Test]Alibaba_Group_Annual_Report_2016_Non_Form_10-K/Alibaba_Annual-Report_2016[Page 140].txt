Our product development expenses increased by 109% from RMB5,093 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB10,658 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was largely due to an increase of RMB5,465 million in payroll
and benefits expenses including share-based compensation expense (an effect that we expect will continue, as
discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above), partially offset by a decrease in the royalty fee paid to Yahoo,
which terminated by contract upon the completion of our initial public offering in September 2014. We expect our
product development expenses will increase in absolute amounts and may over time increase as a percentage
of revenues.

Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 87% from RMB4,545 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB8,513 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was due primarily to the consolidation of marketing expenses
of acquired businesses (mainly UCWeb and AutoNaVi), and also to an increase in advertising and promotional
spending mainly focused on strengthening consumer connection to our Taobao and Tmall brands, especially in
lower tier cities, as well as to promote our new businesses initiatives (e.g., ofﬂine commerce) during fiscal year
2015. The increase was also due to an increase in share-based compensation expense (an effect that we expect will
continue, as discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above). We expect our sales and marketing expenses will
increase in absolute amounts and may increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in marketing
and promotion.

Our general and administrative expenses increased by 85 % from RMB4,218 million in fiscal year 2014 to

compensation expense (an effect that we expect will continue, as discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above).
Our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2014 included a one-time equity-settled donation expense of
RMB1,269 million relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit
