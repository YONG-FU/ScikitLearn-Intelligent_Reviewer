Transactions and Agreements with SoftBank and Yahoo
Voting Agreement
We have entered into a voting agreement with Jack Ma, Joe Tsai, SoftBank and Yahoo, which provides
SoftBank with the right to nominate one director to our board of directors who will, subject to certain conditions,
have the right to receive notices and materials for all meetings of our committees and to join such meetings as an
observer, which rights are also reﬂected in our memorandum and articles of association. These nomination rights
will terminate when SoftBank’s shareholding declines below 15% of our outstanding shares. The voting agreement
also contains provisions to the effect that:
0 SoftBank agrees (i) to vote its shares in favor of the election of the Alibaba Partnership’s director nominees
at each annual general shareholders meeting until SoftBank’s shareholding declines below 15% of our
outstanding shares and (ii) to grant the voting power of any portion of its shareholdings exceeding 30% of
our outstanding ordinary shares to Jack and Joe by proxy;
° Jack and Joe will vote their shares and any other shares over which they hold voting rights in favor of the
election of the SoftBank director nominee at each annual general shareholders meeting in which the
SoftBank nominee stands for election until SoftBank’s shareholding declines below 15% of our outstanding
ordinary shares;
° Yahoo agrees (i) to vote its shares in favor of the election of all of the Alibaba Partnership’s director
nominees and the SoftBank director nominee, if so standing for election, at each annual general
shareholders meeting until SoftBank’s shareholding declines below 15% of our outstanding shares and (ii) to
grant the voting power over any shares it owns, up to 121.5 million of our ordinary shares, to Jack and Joe
by proxy;
° each party to the voting agreement will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any other person
with whom it jointly files a statement (or an amendment to a statement) on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G
pursuant to the Exchange Act to become a party to the voting agreement and vote its shares in favor of
SoftBank’s and the Alibaba Partnership’s director nominees pursuant to the foregoing; and
° SoftBank and Yahoo will receive certain information rights in connection with the preparation of their
financial statements.
SoftBank’s and Yahoo’s proxy obligations described in clause (ii) in the first bullet and the third bullet above,
respectively, shall (a) not apply in respect of any proposal submitted to our shareholders that may result in an
issuance of shares or other equity interests of us, including securities exchangeable or convertible into shares, that
would increase the amount of our then-outstanding shares by 3% or more and (b) terminate when Jack owns less
than 1% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis or if we materially breach the voting agreement.
