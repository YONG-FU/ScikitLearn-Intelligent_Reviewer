Share-based compensation expense increased significantly in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 as compared to fiscal
year 2014 due to performance-based and retention grants of share-based awards to our employees and senior
management members prior to our initial public offering as well as the increase in average fair market value of the
awards granted. In addition, as a result of “mark-to-market” accounting required under US. GAAP, the increase in
share-based compensation expense also reﬂected the re-measurement charge relating to our share-based awards
granted to the employees of Ant Financial Services and share-based awards of Ant Financial Services granted to
our employees by Junhan. The following table sets forth an analysis of share-based compensation expense by type

The expense arising from Ant Financial Services’ share-based awards granted to our employees represents a
non-cash charge that will not result in any economic costs or equity dilution to our shareholders. It is the view of
Jack Ma, our executive chairman, who controls Ant Financial Services, that the grant of these equity awards to our
employees will benefit us because of the strategic importance of Ant Financial Services as a payment service
provider to us and our significant participation in the profit and value accretion of Ant Financial Services through
our agreements with Ant Financial Services.
We expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by the change in fair value
of our shares, our subsidiaries’ share-based awards (including Youku Tudou and Lazada) and the quantity of
awards we grant to our employees and consultants in the future. Furthermore, our share-based compensation
expense will also be affected by the anticipated increase in fair value of share-based awards of Ant Financial
Services. As a result of these factors, we expect that our share-based compensation expense will likely increase. See

Underlying Awards” for additional information regarding our share—based compensation expense.
