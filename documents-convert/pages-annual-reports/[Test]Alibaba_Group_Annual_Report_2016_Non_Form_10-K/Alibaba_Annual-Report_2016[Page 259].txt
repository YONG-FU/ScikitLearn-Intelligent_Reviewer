(e) Acquisition of Alibaba Pictures Group Limited (“Alibaba Pictures”)
In June 2014, the Company acquired control of Alibaba Pictures by completing an investment in newly issued
ordinary shares representing an approximately 60% equity interest in Alibaba Pictures for a total cash
consideration of HK$6,244 million (RMB4,955 million). Alibaba Pictures is a producer of movies and
television programs in the PRC that is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition is summarized as follows:
Amounts
(in millions of RMB)
Net assets acquired (i) 5,899
Amortizable intangible assets (ii)
User base and customer relationships 4
Trade names, trademarks and domain names 95
Others 38
Goodwill 9,759
Deferred tax assets 13
Deferred tax liabilities (17)
Noncontrolling interests (10,836)
Total 4,955
(i) Net assets include the cash consideration of RMB4,955 million.
(ii) Acquired amortizable intangible assets have estimated amortization periods not exceeding three years and
a weighted-average amortization period of 2.5 years.
The rationale for this transaction is to enable the Company to expand its products and services. The Company
believes the acquisition will help to advance the Company’s vision of making media entertainment available to
its customers. Goodwill arising from this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the
combined operations of Alibaba Pictures and the Company, the assembled workforce and their knowledge and
experience in the entertainment and media industry in the PRC.
In June 2015, Alibaba Pictures placed newly issued ordinary shares to unrelated third-party investors with
aggregate gross proceeds of HK$12,179 million (RMB9,647 million). The Company’s equity interest in Alibaba
Pictures was therefore diluted to 49.5% upon completion of the placing.
As a result of the dilution, the Company deconsolidated the financial results of Alibaba Pictures and
accounted for the investment in the remaining equity interest under the equity method. A gain of
RMB24,734 million arising from the revaluation of the Company’s remaining equity interest in Alibaba
Pictures was recognized in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income statement for the
year ended March 31, 2016. As Alibaba Pictures is a publicly listed company, the fair value of the remaining
equity interest was estimated with reference to the market price upon the completion of the placing.
In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company disposed of its online movie ticketing
business and movie and TV series financing platform to Alibaba Pictures at a cash consideration of
US$350 million (RMB2,259 million) plus certain reimbursement amounts. A disposal gain of
RMB2,214 million was recognized in interest and investment income, net in the consolidated income
statement for the year ended March 31, 2016.
