addition, Jack Ma, our executive chairman, and Joe Tsai, our executive vice chairman, have jointly entered into our
plans as affiliated purchasers.
In addition, our equity incentive award agreements generally provide that, in the event of a grantee’s
termination for cause or violation of a non-competition undertaking, we will have the right to repurchase the
shares acquired by such grantee, generally at par or the exercise price paid for such shares. See “Item 6. Directors,
Senior Management and Employees — B. Compensation — Equity Incentive Plans.” In addition, when an
employee leaves our company, we repurchase any shares acquired by such employee pursuant to early-exercised
but unvested options.
The table below summarizes the repurchases we made in the periods indicated.

We are a “foreign private issuer” (as such term is defined in Rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act), and our
ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Under Section 303A of
the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, New York Stock Exchange listed companies that are
foreign private issuers are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the corporate governance provisions
specified by the New York Stock Exchange with limited exceptions. The following summarizes some significant
ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by domestic companies under the
listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.
