which is the functional currency of our major operating subsidiaries and the reporting currency of our financial

The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may ﬂuctuate and is affected by,
among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the
PRC government. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its policy of pegging the value of the Renminbi
to the U.S. dollar. Following the removal of the U.S. dollar peg, the Renminbi appreciated more than 20% against
the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the
exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. In June 2010, the
People’s Bank of China increased the ﬂexibility of the exchange rate and between June 30, 2010 and December 31,
2013, the value of the Renminbi appreciated approximately 12.0% against the U.S. dollar, although the value of
the Renminbi depreciated approximately 2.5% against the U.S. dollar in 2014. In August 2015, the People’s Bank
of China changed the way it calculates the mid-point price of Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, requiring the
market-makers who submit for reference rates to consider the previous day’s closing spot rate, foreign-exchange
demand and supply as well as changes in major currency rates. As a result, in 2015, the value of the Renminbi
depreciated approximately 5.8% against the U.S. dollar, and from December 31, 2015 through May 20, 2016, the
value of the Renminbi further depreciated approximately 1.1% against the U.S. dollar. There remains significant
international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more ﬂexible currency policy, which could result in
greater ﬂuctuations of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict how market
forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar
in the future.
To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would reduce the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Conversely,
if we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our
ordinary shares or ADSs, servicing our outstanding debts, or for other business purposes, appreciation of the
U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would reduce the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.
As of March 31, 2015, we had Renminbi-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
of RMB107,089 million and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents of US$2,461 million. Assuming we
had converted RMB107,089 million into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB6.199 for US$1.00 as of
March 31, 2015, our total U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$19,736 million. If the Renminbi had
depreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar, our U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$18,166 million.
As of March 31, 2016, we had Renminbi-denominated cash and cash equivalents and short term investments
of RMB82,302 million and U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents of US$4,359 million. Assuming we
had converted RMB82,302 million into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of RMB6.448 for US$1.00 as of
March 31, 2016, our total U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$17,123 million. If the Renminbi had
depreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar, our U.S. dollar cash balance would have been US$15,963 million.
Market Price Risk
We are exposed to market price risk primarily with respect to investment securities, to a lesser extent interest
rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, held by us which are reported at fair value. A substantial portion of
our investment in equity investees are all held for long-term appreciation or for strategic purposes. All of these are
accounted for under cost or equity method and not subject to market price risk. We are not exposed to commodity
price risk.
The sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure of financial assets at fair value to market price
risks related to equity and debt securities at the end of each reporting period. The securities we hold are
accounted for as convertible bonds, trading securities or available-for-sale securities. Their changes in fair values
are recorded as income for convertible bonds and trading securities or through equity for available-for-sale
securities, respectively. If market prices of the respective instruments held by us had been 1% higher/lower as of
March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, our investment securities would have been approximately RMB169 million
