ending March 31, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2017. The guidance may be
applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the year of
adoption. Early application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We are evaluating the effects, if
any, of the adoption of this revised guidance on our financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” which
requires debt issuance costs relating to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The new guidance is
effective retrospectively for us for the year end ending March 31, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the
year ending March 31, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of
this revised guidance on our financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows. At this time, we do not expect
this accounting standard update to have a material impact on the financial statements.
In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015—16, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) — Simplifying the
Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,” which eliminates the requirement to restate prior period
financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of
a measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in
which the adjustment is identified. The new guidance is effective prospectively for us for the year end ending
March 31, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2017. Early adoption is permitted.
We are evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this revised guidance on our financial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015—17, “Income Taxes (Topic 740) — Balance Sheet Classification
of Deferred Taxes,” which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and
liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for us for the year ending
March 31, 2018 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2018. Early adoption is permitted.
The new guidance may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to
all periods presented. We are evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this revised guidance on our
financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows. At this time, we do not expect this accounting standard
update to have a material impact on the financial statements.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 “Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10) —
Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,” which amends various aspects of the
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated
financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the accounting for equity investments. It will impact the
disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. The new guidance is effective for us for the year
ending March 31, 2019 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2019. Early adoption is
permitted only for certain provisions. We are evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this revised guidance
on our financial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 “Leases” to increase transparency and comparability among
organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information
about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 creates a new ASC 842 “Leases” to replace the previous ASC 840
“Leases.” ASU 2016-02 affects both lessees and lessors, although for the latter the provisions are similar to the
previous model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and also the new revenue
recognition provisions contained in ASU 2014-09. The new guidance is effective for us for the year ending
March 31, 2020 and interim reporting periods during the year ending March 31, 2020. Early adoption is permitted.
We are evaluating the effects, if any, of the adoption of this revised guidance on our financial position, results of
operations or cash ﬂows.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05 “Derivatives and Hedging: Effect of Derivative Contract
Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships,” which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a
derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC 815 “Derivatives and
hedging,” does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other
