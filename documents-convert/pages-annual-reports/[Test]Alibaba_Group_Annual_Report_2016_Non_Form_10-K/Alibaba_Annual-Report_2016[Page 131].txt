Revenue from our China commerce retail business increased by 34% from RMB59,732 million in fiscal year
2015 to RMB80,033 million (US$12,412 million) in fiscal year 2016.
Revenue growth during this period reﬂected an increase of 27% in GMV transacted on these marketplaces
and an increase in the monetization rate. GMV transacted on Taobao Marketplace increased by 18% from
RMB1,597 billion in fiscal year 2015 to RMB1,877 billion (US$295 billion) in fiscal year 2016 and GMV transacted
on Tmall increased by 43% from RMB847 billion in fiscal year 2015 to RMB1,215 billion (US$190 billion) in fiscal
year 2016. The overall increase in total GMV transacted on these marketplaces was primarily driven by a 21%
increase in the number of buyers and, to a lesser extent, by a moderate increase in the average level of their
spending. The growth in GMV transacted on Tmall in particular was attributable to the increase in the number of
buyers making purchases on Tmall, reﬂecting consumer preferences for branded products and a premium shopping
experience and the beneficial impact of promotional events, and increases in the average level of spending of
buyers. Our monetization rate during this period increased from 2.44% in fiscal year 2015 to 2.59% in fiscal year
2016, mainly as a result of the accelerated growth of our online marketing services revenue.
Online marketing services revenue increased by 40% from RMB37,509 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB52,396 million (US$8,126 million) in fiscal year 2016. The growth was primarily driven by our focus on
high-quality merchants and on delivering a broader value proposition to our merchants. This resulted in higher
marketing spend by our merchants as we optimized online marketing efficiency and added new online marketing
inventory on both mobile and PC interfaces, leading to a 44% increase in the number of clicks attributable to our
P4P marketing services, and a 1% increase in the cost-per-click paid by our merchants. To a lesser extent, our
online marketing services revenue during this period was also positively impacted by an increase in the CPM of
our display marketing services, partially offset by a decrease in the number of impressions displayed.
Commission revenue increased by 22% from RMB21,201 million in fiscal year 2015 to RMB25,829 million
(US$4,006 million) in fiscal year 2016. The lower year-over-year commission revenue growth relative to the 43%
increase in GMV transacted on Tmall during the same period was mainly a result of (i) suspension of our online
lottery business on Taobao Marketplace (which had a higher monetization rate than our overall monetization rate)
in late February 2015 in response to regulatory requirements, (ii) a decrease in the pricing charged on Juhuasuan
as an investment to acquire more high-quality merchants and (iii) impact from changes in category mix. Excluding
the effect of the online lottery business, our revenue would have increased by 31% in fiscal year 2016 from fiscal
year 2015. Due to the ongoing shift of user engagement toward mobile devices, categories such as virtual goods on
which we charge a lower commission rate, are seeing higher growth than other categories. As a result of the above,
commission revenue increased at a lower rate than the T mall GMV.
Mobile revenue from our China commerce retail business increased by 182% from RMB17,840 million in
fiscal year 2015 to RMB50,337 million in fiscal year 2016, representing 63% of our China commerce retail business
