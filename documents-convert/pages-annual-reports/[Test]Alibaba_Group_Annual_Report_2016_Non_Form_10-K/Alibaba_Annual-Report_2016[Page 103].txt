Since SAFE Circular 142 has been in place for more than five years, SAFE decided to further reform the
foreign exchange administration system in order to satisfy and facilitate the business and capital operations of
foreign invested enterprises, and issued the Circular on the Relevant Issues Concerning the Launch of Reforming
Trial of the Administration Model of the Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises
in Certain Areas on August 4, 2014. This circular suspends the application of SAFE Circular 142 in certain areas
and allows a foreign-invested enterprise registered in such areas with a business scope including “investment” to
use the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital for equity investments within the PRC. On
April 9, 2015, SAFE released the Notice on the Reform of the Administration Method for the Settlement of
Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which came into force and
superseded SAFE Circular 142 on June 1, 2015. Circular 19 allows foreign invested enterprises to settle their
foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis according to the actual needs of their business operation and
provides the procedures for foreign invested companies to use Renminbi converted from foreign
currency-denominated capital for equity investment. Nevertheless, Circular 19 also reiterates the principle that
Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign—invested company may not be directly
or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope. Since Circular 19 was only recently promulgated, there
are uncertainties on how it will be interpreted and implemented in practice.
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange
Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and simplifies the current
foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange
accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts,
the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits
and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or
verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces,
which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the
Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the
Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over
direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process
foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information
provided by SAFE and its branches. In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Simplifying and
Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13,
which became effective on June 1, 2015. Under SAFE Circular 13, the current foreign exchange procedures will be
further simplified, and foreign exchange registrations of direct investment will be handled by the banks designated
by the foreign exchange authority instead of SAFE and its branches. However, the foreign invested enterprises are
still prohibited by SAFE Circular 13 to use the RMB converted from foreign currency-registered capital to extend
entrustment loans, repay bank loans or inter-company loans.
We typically do not need to use our offshore foreign currency to fund our PRC operations. In the event we
need to do so, we will apply to obtain the relevant approvals of SAFE and other PRC government authorities
as necessary.
SAFE Circular 3 7
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic
Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or
SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as “SAFE Circular 75”
promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local
branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the
purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’ legally owned assets or equity interests in
domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle.”
SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with
respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share
