8. Share-based awards (Continued)
(b) Restricted shares and RSUs relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
As of March 31, 2015 and 2016, 6,447,715 and 5,880,443 outstanding RSUs were granted to non-employees,
respectively. These awards are subject to re-measurement through each vesting date to determine the
appropriate share-based compensation expense.
As of March 31, 2016, there were RMB12,688 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
outstanding restricted shares and RSUs, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to
these awards granted to non-employees. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 2.1 years.
During the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the Company recognized share—based compensation
expense of RMB2,378 million, RMB7,767 million and RMB9,915 million, respectively, in connection with the
above restricted shares and RSUs, net of reimbursement from Ant Financial Services (Note 23).
(c) Partner Capital Investment Plan relating to ordinary shares of the Company
During the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company offered selected members of the Alibaba
Partnership subscription rights to acquire restricted shares of the Company. These rights and the underlying
restricted shares are only subject to a non-compete provision but not other vesting conditions (employment or
otherwise) and they entitle the holders to purchase restricted shares at US$14.50 per share during a four-year
period. Upon the exercise of such rights, the underlying ordinary shares may not be transferred for a period of
eight years from the date of subscription of the relevant rights. The number of ordinary shares underlying
these rights is 18,000,000 shares of which the rights to subscribe 14,500,000 shares were offered and subscribed
up to March 31, 2016. These rights were accounted for as a noncontrolling interest of the Company as such
rights were issued by the subsidiaries and classified as equity at the subsidiary level. Share-based compensation
expense of nil, RMB211 million and nil was recognized in connection with these rights for the years ended
March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
The fair value of each right to acquire restricted shares is estimated on the subscription date using the Black-
Scholes model and the assumptions below:
Year ended
March 31,
2014 2015
Risk-free interest rate (i) 1.03% 1.50%
Expected dividend yield (ii) 0% 0%
Expected life (years) (iii) 4.00 4.00
Expected volatility (iv) 36.9% 38.1%
Discount for post-vesting sale restrictions (v) 38.0% 35.0%
(i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to
the expected life of the share-based awards in effect at the time of grant.
(ii) Expected dividend is assumed to be 0% as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a
dividend on its ordinary shares.
(iii) Expected life of the rights is based on management’s estimate on timing of redemption for ordinary
shares by the participants.
