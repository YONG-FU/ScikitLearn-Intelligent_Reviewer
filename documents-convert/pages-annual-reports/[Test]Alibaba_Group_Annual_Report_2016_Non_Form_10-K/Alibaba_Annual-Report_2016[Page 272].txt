Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital
gains. In addition, upon payments of dividends by the Company to its shareholders, no Cayman Islands
withholding tax is imposed. The Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong were subject to the Hong
Kong profits tax rate at 16.5% for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. The Company’s
subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States, Singapore and Japan were subject to
income tax charges calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantially enacted in the countries
where the Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate income.
Current income tax expense primarily represents the provision for PRC Enterprise Income Tax (“EIT”) for
subsidiaries operating in the PRC. These subsidiaries are subject to EIT on their taxable income as reported
in their respective statutory financial statements adjusted in accordance with the relevant tax laws, rules and
regulations in the PRC.
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), the standard enterprise income tax rate for
domestic enterprises and foreign invested enterprises is 25%. In addition, the EIT Law provides for, among
others, a preferential tax rate of 15% for enterprises qualified as High and New Technology Enterprises.
Further, certain subsidiaries were recognized as having status as a Software Enterprise and thereby entitled to
enjoy full exemption from EIT for two years beginning with their first profitable year and a 50% reduction for
the subsequent three years. In addition, a duly recognized Key Software Enterprise within China’s national
plan can enjoy a preferential EIT rate of 10%. The Key Software Enterprise status is subject to review by the
relevant authorities every two years. The timing of the annual review and notification by the relevant
authorities may vary from year to year, and the related tax adjustments in relation to the change in applicable
EIT rate are accounted for in the period in which the Key Software Enterprise status is recognized.
The tax status of the subsidiaries of the Company with major taxable profits is described below:
0 Alibaba (China) Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alibaba China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations of
the Company’s wholesale marketplaces, was recognized as a High and New Technology Enterprise and Key
Software Enterprise during the taxation years of 2013 and 2014, and was thereby entitled to an EIT rate of
