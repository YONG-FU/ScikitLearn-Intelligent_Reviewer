Dividend Policy
Since our inception, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our ordinary shares. We have no present
plan to pay any dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain most, if not all, of
our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.
Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and may
be based on a number of factors, including our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus,
general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem
relevant. If we pay any dividends, the depositary will pay our ADS holders to the same extent as holders of our
ordinary shares, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder.
Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in US. dollars.
We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. In order for us to distribute any dividends to
our shareholders and ADS holders, we rely on dividends distributed by our PRC subsidiaries. Dividend
distributions from our PRC subsidiaries to us are subject to PRC taxes, such as withholding tax. In addition,
regulations in the PRC currently permit payment of dividends of a PRC company only out of accumulated
distributable after—tax profits as determined in accordance with its articles of association and the accounting
standards and regulations in China. See “Item 3. Key Information — D. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing
Business in the People’s Republic of China — We rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions
on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries in China and on remittances, including loans, from the
variable interest entities in China to fund offshore cash and financing requirements.”
B. Signiﬁcant Changes
We have not experienced any significant changes since the date of our audited consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report.
