Revenue from our international commerce retail business increased by 88% from RMB938 million in fiscal
year 2014 to RMB1,768 million in fiscal year 2015. The main reason for this increase was an increase in GMV
transacted on AliExpress, primarily from the increasing number of buyers, particularly in Russia, Brazil and the
United States.
Revenue from our international commerce wholesale business increased by 21% from RMB3,913 million in
fiscal year 2014, of which 88% was from membership fees and value-added services and 12% was from online
marketing services, to RMB4,718 million in fiscal year 2015, of which 85% was from membership fees and value-
added services and 15% was from online marketing services. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in the
number of paying members and an increase in average revenue from paying members.
Other revenue
Other revenue in fiscal year 2015 was RMB5,510 million, an increase of 215% compared to RMB1,748 million
in fiscal year 2014. This increase was primarily due to the consolidation of revenue from acquired businesses
(mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi) in a total amount of RMB2,489 million, and an increase in interest income
generated by the SME loan business before this business was transferred to Ant Financial Services upon the
completion of the restructuring of our relationship with Ant Financial Services in early February 2015.

Percentageofrevenue.............................. 25% 31%
Our cost of revenue increased by 78% from RMB13,369 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB23,834 million in
fiscal year 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases of RMB4,183 million in payroll and benefits expense
mainly resulting from an increase in share-based compensation expense (an effect that we expect will continue, as
discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above), an increase of RMB1,653 million in bandwidth and co-location
fees and depreciation expenses as a result of our investments in our cloud computing business and our data
platform, an increase of RMB1,487 million in payment processing fees resulting from an increase in GMV
transacted on our retail marketplaces and an increase of RMB951 million in traffic acquisition costs as a result of
the expansion of our third-party affiliate marketing ecosystem. As we continue to invest in our business, customer
service initiatives and infrastructure, we expect our cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollar amounts and
will likely increase as a percentage of revenues.
