respectively. Accumulated impairment losses were RMB2,995 million and RMB3,450 million as of the
same dates, respectively.
In the annual impairment assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of
respective reporting units exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of RMB44 million,
RMB175 million and RMB455 million during the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
The impairment losses were resulted from a revision of long-term financial outlook and the change in business
model of those reporting units. The impairment charge was determined by comparing the carrying amount of
goodwill associated with that reporting unit with the implied fair value of the goodwill.
18. Deferred revenue and customer advances
Deferred revenue and customer advances primarily represent service fees prepaid by merchants for which the
relevant services have not been provided. The respective balances are as follows:
As of March 31,
2015 2016
(in millions of RMB)

All service fees received in advance are initially recorded as customer advances. These amounts are
transferred to deferred revenue upon commencement of the provision of services by the Company and are
recognized in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are provided. In general,
service fees received in advance are non-refundable after such amounts are transferred to deferred revenue.
