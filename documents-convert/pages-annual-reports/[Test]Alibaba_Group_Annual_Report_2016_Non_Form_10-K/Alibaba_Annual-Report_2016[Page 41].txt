In the opinion of Fangda Partners, our PRC counsel, the ownership structures of our material wholly-foreign
owned enterprises and our material variable interest entities in China do not and will not violate any applicable
PRC law, regulation or rule currently in effect; and the contractual arrangements between our material
wholly-foreign owned enterprises, our material variable interest entities and their respective equity holders
governed by PRC law are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws
and regulations currently in effect and will not violate any applicable PRC law, rule or regulation currently in
effect. However, Fangda Partners has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the
interpretation and application of current PRC laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory
authorities and PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.
It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures
will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. Please also see “— Substantial uncertainties exist with
respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC Foreign Investment Law.”
If we or any of our variable interest entities are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws,
rules or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC
regulatory authorities would have broad discretion to take action in dealing with such violations or failures,
including revoking the business and operating licenses of our PRC subsidiaries or the variable interest entities,
requiring us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restricting our right to collect revenue, blocking one or more
of our websites, requiring us to restructure our operations or taking other regulatory or enforcement actions
against us. The imposition of any of these measures could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to
conduct all or any portion of our business operations. In addition, it is unclear what impact the PRC government
actions would have on us and on our ability to consolidate the financial results of any of our variable interest
entities in our consolidated financial statements, if the PRC government authorities were to find our legal structure
and contractual arrangements to be in violation of PRC laws, rules and regulations. If the imposition of any of
these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of any of our material variable interest
entities or otherwise separate from any of these entities and if we are not able to restructure our ownership
structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results
of our variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements. Any of these events would have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC
Foreign Investment Law.
The MOFCOM published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming
to, upon its enactment, replace the major existing laws and regulations governing foreign investment in China.
While the MOFCOM completed the solicitation of the comments on this draft in February 2015, there are still
substantial uncertainties with respect to its enactment timetable.
Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law purports to introduce the principle of “actual control”
in determining whether a company is considered a foreign invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign
Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China but “controlled” by foreign investors will be
treated as FIEs, whereas an entity organized in a foreign jurisdiction, but cleared by the MOFCOM as
“controlled” by PRC entities and/or citizens, would nonetheless be treated as a PRC domestic entity for investment
in the “restriction category” on the “negative list.” In this connection, “control” is broadly defined in the draft law
to cover any of the following summarized categories:
0 holding 50% or more of the voting rights or similar rights and interests of the subject entity;
0 holding less than 50% of the voting rights or similar rights and interests of the subject entity but having the
power to directly or indirectly appoint or otherwise secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other
equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to materially inﬂuence the board, the
shareholders’ meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or
