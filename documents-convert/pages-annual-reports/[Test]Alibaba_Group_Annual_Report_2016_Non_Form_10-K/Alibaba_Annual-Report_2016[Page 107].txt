Anti-money Laundering Regulations
The PRC Anti-money Laundering Law, which became effective on January 1, 2007, sets forth the principal
anti—money laundering requirements applicable to both financial and non-financial institutions with anti-money
laundering obligations, such as Alipay, including the adoption of precautionary and supervisory measures,
establishment of various systems for client identification, preservation of clients’ identification information and
transactions records, and reports on block transactions and suspicious transactions. The Payment Services Measures
also require that the payment institution follow the rules associated with anti-money laundering and comply with
their anti—money laundering obligations.
In addition, the PBOC promulgated the Administrative Measures for Payment Institutions Regarding
Anti-money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing on March 5, 2012, or the Anti-money Laundering
Measures, according to which the payment institution must establish and improve unified anti-money laundering
internal control systems and file such systems with the local branch of the PBOC. The Anti-money Laundering
Measures also require the payment institution to set up an anti-money laundering department or designate an
internal department to be responsible for anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing work.
Alipay is in the process of expanding its business internationally, and it may become subject to additional laws,
rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it chooses to operate. These regulatory regimes may be complex
and require extensive time and resources to ensure compliance.
