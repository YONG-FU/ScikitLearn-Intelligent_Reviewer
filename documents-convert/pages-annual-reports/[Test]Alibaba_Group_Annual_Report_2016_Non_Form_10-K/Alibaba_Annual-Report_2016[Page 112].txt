Overview
We achieved significant growth and strong operating results in fiscal year 2016. Our total revenue increased by
45% from RMB52,504 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB76,204 million in fiscal year 2015, and further increased
by 33% to RMB101,143 million (US$15,686 million) in fiscal year 2016. Our net income increased by 4% from
RMB23,403 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB24,320 million in fiscal year 2015 and further increased by 193% to
RMB71,289 million (US$11,056 million) in fiscal year 2016. Our GMV surpassed RMB3 trillion in fiscal year 2016.
We believe our focus on long-term strategic priorities — globalization, rural expansion, building a world-class cloud
computing business and creating a comprehensive media and entertainment platform — has laid a strong
foundation for future growth.
