(3) Upon the completion of our initial public offering in September 2014, all of our then outstanding convertible preference shares were
converted into ordinary shares.

Non-GAAP Measures
We use non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash ﬂow, each a
non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making
purposes.
We believe that non-GAAP EBIT DA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS help identify
underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that
we include in income from operations, net income and diluted EPS. We believe that non-GAAP EBITDA,
non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about our core operating results,
enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility
with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
We consider free cash ﬂow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and
investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions,
including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening
our balance sheet.
Non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS and free cash ﬂow should not be
considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, net income, diluted EPS, cash
ﬂows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP
financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other
companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures to our data.
Non-GAAP EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense,
other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees, (ii) certain non-cash expenses,
consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation, impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets as well as (iii) one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity—
settled donation expense that we do not believe are reﬂective of our core operating performance during the
periods presented.
Non-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization,
impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of
investments, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the restructuring of commercial arrangements
with Ant Financial Services, and one-time expense items relating to the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, an
equity-settled donation expense, the expenses relating to the sale of shares by existing shareholders in our initial
public offering, charge for financing—related fees as a result of early repayment of bank borrowings and others.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis, including accounting for
the effects of the assumed conversion of convertible preference shares prior to our initial public offering in
September 2014.
Free cash ﬂow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash ﬂow
statement less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets (excluding acquisition of land use rights
and construction in progress), and adjusted for changes in loan receivables relating to micro loans of our SME
loan business (which we transferred to Ant Financial Services in February 2015), the Yahoo TIPLA amendment
payment and others. We present the adjustment for changes in loan receivables because such receivables are
reﬂected under cash ﬂow from operating activities, whereas the secured borrowings and other bank borrowings
used to finance them are reﬂected under cash ﬂows from financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is
made to show cash ﬂows from operating activities net of the effect of changes in loan receivables.
