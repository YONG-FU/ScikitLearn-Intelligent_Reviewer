Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenue in fiscal year 2016 would have remained stable at 5% in both fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016.

Amortization of intangible assets increased by 40% from RMB2,089 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB2,931 million (US$455 million) in fiscal year 2016. This increase was due to an increase in intangible assets
recognized arising from our strategic acquisitions and investments. Because of the recent major acquisitions we will
consolidate, such as Youku Tudou and our controlling stake in Lazada, we expect that our amortization of
intangible assets will increase in the future.

Our income from operations increased by 26% from RMB23,135 million, or 30% of revenue in fiscal year
2015 to RMB29,102 million (US$4,513 million), or 29% of revenue, in fiscal year 2016. The decrease in our
operating margin was primarily attributable to investments in new business initiatives, such as our mobile operating
systems, over-the-top TV services and entertainment, and also to an increase in logistics costs, as discussed above.
Interest and Investment Income, Net
Our net interest and investment income increased significantly from RMB9,455 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB52,254 million (US$8,104 million) in fiscal year 2016. The increase was primarily due to a non-cash deemed
disposal gain of RMB24,734 million (US$3,836 million) arising from the deconsolidation of Alibaba Pictures, a
non-cash gain of RMB18,603 million (US$2,885 million) from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest
in Alibaba Health when we obtained control over Alibaba Health in fiscal year 2016, as well as gains arising from
disposals of certain investments and businesses. See note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the years
ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 included elsewhere in this annual report for further information.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense decreased by 29% from RMB2,750 million in fiscal year 2015 to RMB1,946 million
(US$301 million) in fiscal year 2016. Interest expense in fiscal year 2015 included an one-time charge for financing-
related fees of RMB830 million as a result of the early repayment of our US$8.0 billion bank borrowings with
proceeds from our issuance of US$80 billion senior unsecured notes.
Other Income, Net
Our other income, net decreased by 17% from RMB2,486 million in fiscal year 2015 to RMB2,058 million
(US$319 million) in fiscal year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income recognized in respect
of royalty fees and software technology services fees from Ant Financial Services, which were RMB1,122 million
