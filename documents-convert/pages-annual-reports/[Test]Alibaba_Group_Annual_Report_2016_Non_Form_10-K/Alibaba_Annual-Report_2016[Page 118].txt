equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our
ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai. As there are no vesting
conditions attached to the above share options, equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million was
recognized in full. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015
and 2016 included elsewhere in this annual report for further information on this expense.

net gain of RMB6,535 million recognized with respect to the revaluation of previously held equity interests,
relating primarily to the step acquisitions of UCWeb, OneTouch and AutoNavi. In fiscal year 2016, we also
recognized a deemed disposal gain of RMB24,734 million (US$3,836 million) arising from the deconsolidation of
Alibaba Pictures and a gain of RMB18,603 million (US$2,885 million) from the revaluation of our previously held
equity interest in Alibaba Health.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense is comprised of interest payments and amortization of upfront fees and incidental
charges associated with our bank borrowings and unsecured senior notes issued in November 2014 to refinance our
previous syndicated loan arrangements. In addition, we obtained a US$30 billion revolving credit facility in
August 2014 and a five-year term loan facility of US$30 billion in March 2016, which has been subsequently
upsized to US$40 billion, both of which we have not yet drawn as of March 31, 2016.
