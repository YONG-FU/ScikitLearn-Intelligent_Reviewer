ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014, 2015 AND 2016
7. Income tax expenses (Continued)
0 Zhejiang Tmall Technology Co., Ltd. (“Tmall China”), an entity primarily engaged in the operations of
Tmall, was recognized as a High and New Technology Enterprise and has been granted the Software
Enterprise status and is thereby entitled to enjoy an income tax exemption for two years beginning with its
first profitable year in taxation year of 2012, and a 50% reduction for the subsequent three years starting in
taxation year of 2014. Accordingly, Tmall China was exempted from EIT during the taxation year of 2013
and entitled to an EIT rate of 12.5% during the taxation years of 2014, 2015 and 2016 and 15% thereafter
for so long as Tmall China continues to qualify as a High and New Technology Enterprise.
The consolidated financial statements did not reﬂect the potential tax rate adjustments that may arise from
the renewal of the Key Software Enterprises status by Alibaba China and Taobao China for the taxation years
of 2015 and 2016 because the annual review and notification has not yet been obtained up to March 31, 2016.
Accordingly, Alibaba China and Taobao China, which continued to qualify as a High and New Technology
Enterprise, applied an EIT rate of 15 % in the consolidated financial statements during these periods.
Most of the remaining PRC entities of the Company are subject to EIT at 25% for the years ended March 31,
2014, 2015 and 2016.
Pursuant to the EIT Law, a 10% withholding tax is levied on dividends declared by PRC companies to their
foreign investors. A lower withholding tax rate of 5% is applicable if direct foreign investors with at least 25%
equity interest in the PRC company are incorporated in Hong Kong and meet the relevant requirements
pursuant to the tax arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong. Since the equity holders of the major
PRC subsidiaries of the Company are Hong Kong incorporated companies, the Company has used 5% to
provide for deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are anticipated to be distributed. As of
March 31, 2016, the Company had fully accrued the withholding tax on the earnings distributable by all of the
subsidiaries of the Company in the PRC, except for those undistributed earnings that the Company intends to
invest indefinitely in the PRC of RMB13.6 billion.
