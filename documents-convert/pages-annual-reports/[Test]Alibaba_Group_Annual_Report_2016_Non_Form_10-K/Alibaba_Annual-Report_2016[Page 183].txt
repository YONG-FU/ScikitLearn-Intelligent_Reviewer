certain intellectual property and asset transfers. Similarly, in connection with our exercise of the pre-emptive right,
under the amended Alipay IPLA, we will receive payments from Ant Financial Services that will effectively fund
our subscription for such additional equity interests up to a value of US$15 billion.
To the extent we acquire the full 33% equity interest pursuant to the provisions of the 2014 SAPA, the
liquidity event payment and the profit share under the amended Alipay IPLA described in “— Alipay Intellectual
Property License and Software Technology Services Agreement” below, other than the payments that effectively
offset the purchase price with respect to the exercise of the pre-emptive right, will automatically terminate. If we
acquire less than the full 33% equity interest in Ant Financial Services pursuant to the provisions of the 2014
SAPA, the liquidity event payment amount and the profit sharing arrangement under the amended Alipay IPLA
will be proportionately reduced based on the amount of equity interests acquired by us.
We believe that under applicable regulatory rules and practices currently in effect, the relevant PRC approvals
necessary for us to own an equity interest in Ant Financial Services would not be granted. There can be no
assurance that such applicable regulatory rules and practices will change in the near future.
Certain Restrictions on the Transfer of Ant Financial Services Equity Interests
Pursuant to the 2014 SAPA and amended Alipay IPLA, certain parties thereto, including in some cases our
company, are subject to restrictions on the transfer of equity interests in Ant Financial Services, including:
0 prior to our acquisition of the full 33% equity interest, none of Jack Ma, Junao, Junhan, our company or
Ant Financial Services may transfer any shares of Ant Financial Services that would result in Jack Ma,
Junao, Junhan and our company, collectively, no longer having beneficial ownership of a majority voting
interest in Ant Financial Services;
0 prior to our acquisition of the full 33% equity interest, none of Jack Ma, Joe Tsai (if he holds any equity
interest at that time), Junao, Junhan, Ant Financial Services or Alipay may transfer any equity interest in
Ant Financial Services or Alipay if, to its knowledge, such transfer would result in a non-PRC person or
entity acquiring beneficial ownership of any equity interest in Ant Financial Services or Alipay;
0 following the earliest occurrence of any equity issuance by Ant Financial Services to us as described above
in the first paragraph under “Share and Asset Purchase Agreement — Potential Equity Interest” and until
the earlier of a qualified IPO of Ant Financial Services or the termination of the independent director
rights provided in the 2014 SAPA, none of Jack Ma, Joe Tsai (if he holds any equity interest at that time),
Junao, Junhan or Ant Financial Services may knowingly transfer any equity in Ant Financial Services to a
third-party who would thereby acquire more than 50% of the voting or economic rights in, or assets of, Ant
Financial Services; and
° in the event we acquire an equity interest in Ant Financial Services, any transfer of equity interests in Ant
Financial Services by Junao or Junhan, on the one hand, or our company, on the other hand, will be subject
to a right of first refusal by the other party.
