offering in September 2014. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product development
expenses as a percentage of revenue would have decreased from 9% in fiscal year 2015 to 8% in fiscal year 2016
due to a decrease in royalty fees paid to Yahoo. We expect our product development expenses will increase in
absolute amounts and may over time increase as a percentage of revenues.

Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 33% from RMB8,513 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB11,307 million (US$1,753 million) in fiscal year 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in
advertising and promotional spending mainly focused on strengthening consumer connection to our Taobao and
T mall brands, especially in top tier cities, as well as to promote our new businesses initiatives, such as Alitrip and
DingTalk, during fiscal year 2016. The increase was also due to an increase in share-based compensation expense
(an effect that we expect will continue, as discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above). Without the effect of
share-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have remained
stable at 9% in both fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will
increase in absolute amounts and may increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in marketing
and promotion.

Our general and administrative expenses increased by 18% from RMB7,800 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB9,205 million (US$1,428 million) in fiscal year 2016. The increase was primarily due to a significant increase
in share-based compensation expense (an effect that we expect will continue, as discussed in “Share-based
Compensation” above), as well as an increase of RMB353 million (US$55 million) in professional services fees.
