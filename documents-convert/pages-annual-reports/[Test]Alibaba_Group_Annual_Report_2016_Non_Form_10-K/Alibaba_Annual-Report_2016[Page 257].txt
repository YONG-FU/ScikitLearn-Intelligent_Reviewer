(c) Acquisition of Alibaba Health Information Technology Limited (“Alibaba Health”) (Continued)
The allocation of the equity value of Alibaba Health at the date of the deemed acquisition is summarized
as follows:
Amounts
(in millions of RMB)
Net assets acquired 1,290
Amortizable intangible assets (i)
User base and customer relationships 8
Trade names, trademarks and domain names 35
Developed technology and patents 70
Goodwill 49,320
Deferred tax assets 19
Deferred tax liabilities (19)
Total 50,723
The equity value comprised of:
- fair value of previously held equity interests 19,264
- fair value of noncontrolling interests 31,459
Total 50,723
(i) Acquired amortizable intangible assets have estimated amortization periods not exceeding three years and
a weighted-average amortization period of 2.6 years.
The rationale for this transaction is to enable the Company to expand its products and services. This
transaction will enable the Company to benefit from the focused healthcare expertise of Alibaba Health in the
operation of the online pharmacy business and foster consumer trust through the sale of genuine
pharmaceuticals through Alibaba Health’s verification and authentication technology. Goodwill arising from
this acquisition was attributable to the synergies expected from the combined business which will create a
technology enabled solution provider to consumers and other participants in the healthcare industry in
the PRC.
Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company and Alibaba Health entered into a services agreement under
which Alibaba Health will provide outsourced services in relation to certain product categories in Tmall online
pharmacy.
(d) Acquisition of AutoNavi Holdings Limited (“AutoNavi”)
In May 2013, the Company completed an investment of newly issued ordinary shares and convertible preferred
shares in AutoNavi representing a 28% equity interest on a fully-diluted basis. AutoNavi is a provider of
digital map content and navigation and location based solutions in the PRC that was listed on the Nasdaq
Global Select Stock Market (“Nasdaq”). The investment in convertible preferred shares of RMB1,285 million
was accounted for under the cost method given that the convertible preferred shares were not considered
in-substance common stock due to the existence of certain terms such as liquidation preference over ordinary
shares, and the investment in ordinary shares of RMB533 million was accounted for under the equity method
given the existence of significant inﬂuence.
