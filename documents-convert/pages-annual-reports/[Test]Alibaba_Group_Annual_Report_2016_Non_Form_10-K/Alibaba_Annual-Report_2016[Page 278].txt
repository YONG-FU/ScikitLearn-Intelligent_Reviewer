8. Share-based awards (Continued)
(a) Share options relating to ordinary shares of the Company (Continued)
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and the
assumptions below:
Year ended March 31,
2014 2015 2016
Risk-free interest rate (i) 0.69% - 1.52% 1.38% - 1.99% 1.24% - 1.79%
Expected dividend yield (ii) 0% 0% 0%
Expected life (years) (iii) 4.25 - 4.38 4.25 - 5.75 4.25 — 5.75
Expected volatility (iv) 37.0% - 39.3% 35.0% - 40.8% 33.4% - 35.7%
(i) Risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of United States Treasury securities with maturities similar to
the expected life of the share options in effect at the time of grant.
(ii) Expected dividend is assumed to be 0% as the Company has no history or expectation of paying a
dividend on its ordinary shares.
(iii) Expected life of share options is based on the average between the vesting period and the contractual
term for each grant.
(iv) Expected volatility is assumed based on the historical volatility of the Company’s comparable companies
in the period equal to the expected life of each grant.
As of March 31, 2016, there were RMB1,021 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
outstanding share options, net of expected forfeitures and after re-measurement applicable to share options
granted to non-employees. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
2.8 years.
