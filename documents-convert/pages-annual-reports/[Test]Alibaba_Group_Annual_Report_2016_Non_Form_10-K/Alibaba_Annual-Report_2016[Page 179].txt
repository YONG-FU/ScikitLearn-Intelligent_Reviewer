2012 and 1.5% of our consolidated revenues (less certain costs) for the period from January 1, 2013 until the
completion of our initial public offering in September 2014. No royalties have been payable since then. For fiscal
years 2014 and 2015, the royalty fees amounted to RMB748 million and RMB448 million, respectively.
Patent Sale and Assignment Agreement with Yahoo
We and Yahoo entered into patent sale and assignment agreements in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, pursuant to
which we acquired ownership of certain patents and patent applications for aggregate consideration of
US$70 million and US$24 million, respectively.
Oar Repurchase of Ordinary Shares from Yahoo
On May 20, 2012, we entered into a share repurchase and preference share sale agreement with Yahoo, or the
Yahoo repurchase agreement. As amended through July 14, 2014, the agreement governed the terms on which we
have repurchased 523,565,416 ordinary shares from Yahoo in September 2012 and caused Yahoo to sell
140,000,000 ADSs representing 140,000,000 of our ordinary shares in connection with our initial public offering in
September 2014. As of March 31, 2016, Yahoo owned 383,565,416 ordinary shares, representing approximately
15.5% of our then issued share capital.
Investments Involving SoftBank
We have invested in businesses in which SoftBank is an existing shareholder or co-invested with SoftBank in
other businesses. SoftBank has also invested in businesses in which we or our controlled entities are existing
shareholders. For instance, in January 2015, we participated in a financing round with SoftBank in Travice Inc., the
operator and developer of Kuaidi Dache, which in February 2015 merged into Didi Chuxing, the leading
transportation network company that provides vehicles and taxis for hire in China via smartphone applications. In
June 2015, we announced that we agreed to invest in SoftBankâ€™s robotics business. We expect that we will continue
to engage in investment activities that involve SoftBank in the future. We may continue to co-invest with SoftBank,
invest in businesses in which SoftBank is already an existing investor, and may also bring SoftBank as an investor
into our new businesses or businesses in which we are an existing investor.
Agreements and r[ransactions Related to Ant Financial Services and Its Subsidiaries
Ownership of Ant Financial Services and Alipay
We originally established Alipay in December 2004 to operate our payment services business. In June 2010,
the PBOC issued new regulations that required non-bank payment companies to obtain a license in order to
operate in China. These regulations provided specific guidelines for license applications only for domestic
PRC-owned entities. These regulations stipulated that, in order for any foreign-invested payment company to
obtain a license, the scope of business, the qualifications of any foreign investor and any level of foreign ownership
would be subject to future regulations to be issued, which in addition would require approval by the PRC State
Council. Further, the regulations required that any payment company that failed to obtain a license must cease
operations by September 1, 2011. Although Alipay was prepared to submit its license application in early 2011, at
that time the PBOC had not issued any guidelines applicable to license applications for foreign-invested payment
companies (and no such guidelines have been issued as of the date of this annual report). In light of the
uncertainties relating to the license qualification and application process for a foreign-invested payment company,
our management determined that it was necessary to restructure Alipay as a company wholly-owned by PRC
nationals in order to avail Alipay of the specific licensing guidelines applicable only to domestic PRC-owned
entities. Accordingly, we divested all of our interest in and control over Alipay in 2011, which resulted in
deconsolidation of Alipay from our financial statements. This action enabled Alipay to obtain a payment business
license in May 2011 without delay and without any detrimental impact to our China retail marketplaces or
to Alipay.
