year 2015 from 12% in fiscal year 2014, due primarily to the expiration of the EIT exemption as discussed above,
and to the increase in share-based compensation expense, which is not deductible for income tax purposes.
Net Income
As a result of the foregoing, our net income increased by 4% from RMB23,403 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB24,320 million in fiscal year 2015.
B. Liquidity and Capital Resources
We fund our operations and strategic investments from cash generated from our operations and through debt
and equity financing. We generated RMB26,379 million, RMB41,217 million and RMB56,836 million
(US$8,815 million) of cash from operating activities for fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. As of
March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB106,818 million
(US$16,566 million) and RMB4,700 million (US$729 million), respectively. Short-term investments consist primarily
of investments in fixed deposits with maturities between three months and one year and investments in money
market funds or other investments whereby we have the intention to redeem within one year.
In November 2014, we issued unsecured senior notes, including ﬂoating rate and fixed rate notes, with varying
maturities for an aggregate principal amount of US$80 billion. Interest on the unsecured senior notes are payable
in arrears, quarterly for the ﬂoating rate notes and semiannually for the fixed-rate notes. We used the proceeds
from the issuance of the unsecured senior notes to refinance our previous syndicated loan arrangements in the
same amount. We are not subject to any financial covenant or other significant covenants or restrictions under the
unsecured senior notes. In December 2015, we completed an exchange offer to exchange our outstanding
unsecured senior notes for unsecured senior notes that have been registered under the Securities Act. See note 21
to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 included elsewhere in
this annual report for further information.
In August 2014, we entered into a revolving loan facility agreement with certain financial institutions for an
amount of US$30 billion which has not yet been drawn down. The interest rate for this credit facility is calculated
based on LIBOR plus 120 basis points. This loan facility is reserved for future general corporate purposes.
In March 2016, we signed a five-year US$30 billion syndicated loan agreement with a group of eight lead
arrangers which has been subsequently drawn down in April 2016. The loan was upsized from US$30 billion to
US$40 billion in May 2016 through a general syndication, of which the upsized portion has not yet been drawn
down. The loan has a five-year bullet maturity and is priced at 110 basis points over LIBOR. The use of proceeds
of the loan is for general corporate and working capital purposes (including funding our acquisitions).
As of March 31, 2016, we also had other bank borrowings of RMB6,175 million (US$957 million), primarily
used for the construction of corporate campuses and office facilities and other working capital purposes. See
note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 included
elsewhere in this annual report for further information.
The following table sets out a summary of our cash ﬂows for the periods indicated.

We believe that our current levels of cash and cash ﬂows from operations will be sufficient to meet our
anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, we may need additional cash resources in the
