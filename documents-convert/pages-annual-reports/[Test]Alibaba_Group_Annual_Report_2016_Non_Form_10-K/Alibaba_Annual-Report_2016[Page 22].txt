we may be engaged in discussing or negotiating a range of these types of transactions. These transactions involve
significant challenges and risks, including:
0 difficulties in integrating into our operations the diverse and large number of personnel, operations,
products, services, technology, internal controls and financial reporting of companies we acquire;
° disruption of our ongoing business, distraction of our management and employees and increase of
our expenses;
0 loss of skilled professionals as well as established client relationships of the businesses we invest in
or acquire;
° for investments over which we may not obtain management and operational control, we may lack inﬂuence
over the controlling partner or shareholder, which may prevent us from achieving our strategic goals in such
investment;
0 regulatory requirements and compliance risks as well as publicity risks that we become subject to as a result
of acquisitions of businesses in new industries or geographic areas or otherwise, especially for acquisitions of
public companies which are subject to heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny;
0 actual or alleged misconduct or non-compliance by us or any company we acquire or invest in (or by its
affiliates), whether before, during or after our acquisition or investment, which may lead to negative
publicity, litigation, government inquiry or investigations against such company or against us;
0 unforeseen or hidden liabilities or costs that may adversely affect us following our acquisition of or our
investment in such companies;
0 potential impairment charges or write-offs due to the changes in the fair value of our investments or
acquired companies as a result of market volatility or other reasons that we may or may not control;
0 regulatory hurdles including in relation to the anti-monopoly and competition laws, rules and regulations of
China and other jurisdictions in connection with any proposed investments and acquisitions, including, in the
case of our potential future acquisition of an equity interest in Ant Financial Services, PRC regulations
pertaining to non-bank payment companies;
0 negative publicity regarding our acquisition and investment activities;
0 the risk that any of our pending or other future proposed acquisitions does not close; and
0 challenges in achieving the expected benefits of synergies and growth opportunities in connection with these
acquisitions and investments, such as the inability to realize the expected benefits of the restructuring in
August 2014 of our relationship with Alipay and Ant Financial Services.
Our significant acquisition activity has occurred recently, and we have limited experience in integrating major
acquisitions. As our acquisition and investment activity continues at a rapid pace, with a large number and diverse
range of target companies, we and our management will continue to face significant challenges, including
unanticipated ones, in integrating these businesses into our existing businesses.
Failure to maintain or improve our technology infrastructure could harm our business and prospects.
We are constantly upgrading our platforms to provide increased scale, improved performance and additional
built-in functionality and additional capacity. Adopting new products and upgrading our ecosystem infrastructure
require significant investments of time and resources, including adding new hardware, updating software and
recruiting and training new engineering personnel. Maintaining and improving our technology infrastructure
require significant levels of investment. Any failure to maintain and improve our technology infrastructure could
result in unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, impaired quality of users’ experiences and delays
in reporting accurate operating and financial information. For example, on Singles Day, there is significantly higher
than normal activity on our marketplaces that our systems must handle. In addition, much of the software and
interfaces we use are internally developed and proprietary technology. If we experience problems with the
functionality and effectiveness of our software or platforms, or are unable to maintain and constantly improve our
technology infrastructure to handle our business needs, our business, financial condition, results of operation and
prospects, as well as our reputation, could be materially and adversely affected.
