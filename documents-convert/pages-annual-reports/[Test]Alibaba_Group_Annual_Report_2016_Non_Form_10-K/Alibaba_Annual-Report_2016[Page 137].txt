Revenue from our China commerce retail business increased by 39% from RMB42,832 million in fiscal year
2014 to RMB59,732 million in fiscal year 2015.
Revenue growth during this period reﬂected an increase of 46% in GMV transacted on these marketplaces,
including a 36% increase in GMV transacted on Taobao Marketplace from RMB1,173 billion in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB1,597 billion in fiscal year 2015 and a 68% increase in GMV transacted on Tmall from RMB505 billion in
fiscal year 2014 to RMB847 billion in fiscal year 2015. The overall increase in total GMV transacted on these
marketplaces was primarily driven by a 37% increase in the number of consumers and, to a lesser extent, by a
moderate increase in the average level of their spending. The rapid increase in GMV transacted on T mall in
particular was attributable to the increase in the number of consumers making purchases on T mall, reﬂecting
consumer preferences for branded products and a premium shopping experience, increases in the average level of
spending of consumers and the beneficial impact of promotional events. Our monetization rate during this period
decreased from 2.55% in fiscal year 2014 to 2.44% in fiscal year 2015, mainly as a result of the higher percentage
of total GMV contributed by mobile GMV, which has a lower monetization rate compared to the non-mobile
monetization rate.
