(i) VAT receivables as of March 31, 2016 mainly represent VAT receivable from relevant PRC tax authorities
arising from OneTouch’s VAT refund service. OneTouch provides advance settlement of relevant VAT
refund amount to its customers prior to receiving such VAT refund from tax authorities. To provide this
service, OneTouch relies on short term banking facilities and takes on credit risk if OneTouch fails to
recover the prepaid VAT amount.
(ii) Amounts due from related parties primarily represent balances arising from transactions with Ant
Financial Services and its subsidiaries (Note 4(b) and 23). The balances are unsecured, interest free and
repayable within the next twelve months.
(iii) The Company is obligated to pay certain costs upon the receipt of membership fees from merchants or
other customers, which primarily consist of sales commissions. The membership fees are initially deferred
and recognized as revenue in the consolidated income statements in the period in which the services are
rendered. As such, the related costs are also initially deferred and recognized in the consolidated income
statements in the same period as the related service fees are recognized.
