(i) Others primarily represent accrued expenses which are not deductible until paid under PRC tax laws.
(ii) The related deferred tax liabilities as of March 31, 2015 and 2016 were provided on the assumption that
100% of the distributable reserves of the major PRC subsidiaries will be distributed as dividends, except
for those undistributed earnings that the Company intends to invest indefinitely in the PRC of
RMB13.6 billion.
Valuation allowances have been provided on the deferred tax assets mainly related to the tax losses carried
forward due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization. If events occur in the future that improve the
certainty of realization, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be made and consequently reduce the
income tax expenses.
