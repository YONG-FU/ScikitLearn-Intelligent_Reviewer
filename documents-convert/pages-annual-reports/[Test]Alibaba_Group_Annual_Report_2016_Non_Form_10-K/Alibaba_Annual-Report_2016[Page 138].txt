Mobile revenue from our China commerce retail business in fiscal year 2015 was RMB17,840 million, an
increase of 514% compared to RMB2,905 million in fiscal year 2014, representing 30% of our China commerce
retail business revenue in fiscal year 2015, compared to 7% in fiscal year 2014. The increase in mobile revenue
from our China commerce retail business was primarily due to an increase in GMV generated on mobile devices
and also to an increase in the mobile monetization rate.
Online marketing services revenue increased by 26% from RMB29,729 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB37,509 million in fiscal year 2015, reﬂecting GMV growth of 46% from RMB1,678 billion in fiscal year 2014
to RMB2,444 billion in fiscal year 2015. The lower growth rate of online marketing services revenue relative to the
GMV growth rate reﬂected the ongoing shift of consumer engagement from personal computers to mobile devices,
as we monetize mobile GMV at a lower rate than GMV transacted on personal computer interfaces because
merchants allocated a smaller proportion of their budget to purchase online marketing services on mobile relative
to the GMV generated on mobile. As a result, mobile GMV accounted for 19% and 41% of total GMV in fiscal
years 2014 and 2015, respectively, while mobile revenue accounted for 7% and 30% of China commerce retail
business revenue, respectively, during those periods. This lower but increasing level of mobile monetization
reﬂected our focus on prioritizing mobile user activity and engagement over monetization and the fact that we
increased our efforts to promote online marketing services for mobile interfaces beginning in the three months
ended December 31, 2013. The increase in online marketing services revenue during this period was primarily
driven by a 55% increase in the number of clicks attributable to our P4P marketing services. This increase was
partially offset by a 21% decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our merchants, as a result of the higher percentage
of total clicks generated on mobile devices, which have a lower cost-per-click compared to cost-per-click on
personal computers. Our strong momentum in mobile and commitment to improving user experience may slow the
growth rate of our online marketing services revenue in the near term, but we believe our approach will create
significant value for both our users and our business in the longer term. To a lesser extent, our online marketing
services revenue during this period was also positively impacted by an increase in the CPM of our display
marketing services, which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of impressions displayed.
Commission revenue increased by 76% from RMB12,023 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB21,201 million in
fiscal year 2015, primarily due to a 68% increase in GMV transacted on T mall during the same period as well as
an increase of RMB989 million in lottery commission income from Taobao marketplace, which was mainly due to
significantly higher activity since the World Cup soccer competition in the summer of 2014 before we suspended
our lottery business in late February 2015, around the same time as the other major online lottery platforms in
China in response to regulatory requirements. The published commission rates we charge by category as well as
our blended commission rate remained relatively stable over this period, and accordingly, the increase in revenue
from commissions during this period was principally a result of increased GMV transacted rather than any change
in the pricing of commission rates. As T mall GMV increased at a higher rate than Taobao Marketplace GMV,
commission revenue grew at a faster rate than online marketing services revenue because we charge commissions
on Tmall. Commission revenue from transactions on Tmall is generated from both personal computer and mobile
transactions, and accordingly the ongoing shift of consumer engagement towards mobile devices did not negatively
affect commission revenue from GMV transacted on T mall.
Revenue from our China commerce wholesale business increased by 39% from RMB2,300 million in fiscal
year 2014 to RMB3,205 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in paying
members and an increase in average revenue from paying members.
