developing and marketing new products and services, enhancing our cloud computing business, and YunOS, a
cloud-based mobile operating system for Internet of Things devices, developing new ways to interact with
consumers through our mobile media and entertainment assets, developing new software tools to attract additional
consumers and merchants to our marketplaces as well as executing our globalization strategy. Our operating
leverage and margin levels enable us to continue to invest in our people, particularly engineers, scientists and
product management personnel, as well as in our underlying technology capabilities and infrastructure. In addition,
as a result of our financial strength, we expect to invest in the above mentioned new and existing businesses which
will lower our margins but deliver overall long-term growth.
Strategic Investments and Acquisitions. We have made, and intend to make, strategic investments and
acquisitions to increase user acquisition and engagement, improve customer experience and expand our product,
service, and content offerings. Our strategic investments and acquisitions may affect our future financial results,
including our margins and our net income. For example, we expect that our recent acquisitions of Youku Tudou
and a controlling stake in Lazada will have a negative effect on our financial results, at least in the short-term. In
addition, some of our acquisitions and investments may not be successful, and we may incur impairment charges in
the future.
