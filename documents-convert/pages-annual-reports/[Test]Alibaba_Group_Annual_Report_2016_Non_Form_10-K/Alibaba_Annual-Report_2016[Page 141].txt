Our income from operations decreased by 7% from RMB24,920 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB23,135 million in fiscal year 2015. Although our revenue increased by 45% year-over-year, income from
operations decreased, due primarily to a significant increase in share-based compensation expense from
RMB2,844 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB13,028 million in fiscal year 2015, and also to other factors affecting
cost and expenses as discussed above.
Our operating margin decreased from 47 % in fiscal year 2014 to 30% in fiscal year 2015. The decrease was
primarily attributable to increase in share-based compensation expense, which amounted to 17% and 5% as a
percentage of revenue in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014, respectively, the consolidation of acquired businesses
with lower overall margins than our margins, mainly UCWeb and AutoNavi, as well as investments in new business
initiatives, such as cloud computing, entertainment, mobile operating system and ofﬂine commerce.
Interest and Investment Income, Net
Our net interest and investment income increased significantly from RMB1,648 million in fiscal year 2014 to
RMB9,455 million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to a net gain of RMB6,535 million
recognized with respect to the revaluation of previously held equity interests, relating primarily to the step
acquisitions of UCWeb, OneTouch and AutoNavi. The increase was also due to an increase in interest income as a
result of higher cash balance during the period, which in turn was due primarily to the proceeds from our initial
public offering in September 2014 and also to an increase in operating cash ﬂow.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense increased by 25% from RMB2,195 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB2,750 million in
fiscal year 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding, with debt outstanding
during fiscal year 2014 primarily reﬂecting a loan of US$5.0 billion drawn down under a US$8.0 billion credit
facility, and debt outstanding during fiscal year 2015 primarily reﬂecting an additional US$30 billion drawn down
under the same credit facility in April 2014, which was refinanced by the US$8.0 billion unsecured senior notes
issued in November 2014.
Other Income, Net
Our other income, net increased by 2% from RMB2,429 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB2,486 million in
fiscal year 2015.
Income Tax Expenses
Our income tax expenses increased by 101% from RMB3,196 million in fiscal year 2014 to RMB6,416 million
in fiscal year 2015. The increase was due primarily to the expiration of an EIT exemption period for one of our
major subsidiaries, upon which the subsidiary is no longer exempt from paying EIT but is subject to an EIT rate of
12.5% (or 50% of the statutory EIT rate) in calendar year 2014. The increase in income tax expenses was also due
to the increase in taxable income from our operations in China. Our effective tax rate increased to 20% in fiscal
