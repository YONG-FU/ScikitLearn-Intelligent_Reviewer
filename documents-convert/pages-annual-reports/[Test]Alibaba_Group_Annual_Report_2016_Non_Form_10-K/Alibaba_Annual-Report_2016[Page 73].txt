Taobao Marketplace is also the entry point to verticals such as online travel booking, operated under the
Alitrip name, and second-hand auctions, operated under the Xianyu (PH E) name, both of which can also be
accessed through their own independent mobile app. Alitrip offers a comprehensive selection of domestic and
international airline tickets, train and bus tickets, hotel bookings, vacation packages and tourist attractions through
online travel agencies and direct travel service providers such as airlines and hotels. Xianyu users trade
second-hand items using the Xianyu mobile app which offers location-based information about products and
merchant rating reviews.
Merchants on Taobao Marketplace are primarily individuals and small businesses. The creation of storefronts
and listings by a merchant on Taobao Marketplace is free of charge. The escrow payment services provided by
Alipay are free of charge to consumers and merchants unless payment is funded through a credit card, in which
case Alipay charges a fee to the merchant based on the related bank fees charged to Alipay. Taobao Marketplace
merchants can purchase P4P and display marketing services to direct traffic to their storefronts. In addition,
merchants can acquire additional traffic from third-party marketing affiliates. Taobao Marketplace merchants can
also pay for advanced storefront software that help to upgrade, decorate and manage their online storefronts.
Tmall
Tmall caters to consumers looking for branded products and a premium shopping experience. A large number
of international and Chinese brands and retailers have established storefronts on Tmall. According to iResearch,
T mall is the largest BZC platform in China in terms of monthly active users in 2015. It is positioned as a trusted
platform for consumers to buy both homegrown and international branded products as well as products not
available in traditional retail outlets.
