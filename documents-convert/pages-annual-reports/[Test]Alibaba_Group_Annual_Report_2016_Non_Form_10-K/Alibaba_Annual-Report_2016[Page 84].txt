Anti-Counterfeiting
To protect consumers, merchants and brands and to maintain the integrity of our marketplaces, we have taken
the following measures through our platforms, with other industry participants and with governmental authorities:
° Through our platforms. We proactively monitor our platforms and have implemented takedown measures to
enforce IP rights, including:
° operating an online takedown platform for brand owners to report infringements;
° offering qualified rights holders a good-faith takedown program on Taobao Marketplace, where we
process infringement takedown requests on a “good—faith” basis by expediting claims and simplifying
the notification procedure;
° conducting real-time initial screening of merchandise when merchants add or modify listings;
° conducting test-buy programs to spot check whether the goods mailed by a merchant are genuine or
meet quality standards; and
0 improving our monitoring system by developing technologies to automate the process and investing in
more manpower.
° With other industry participants. We have established cooperative relationships with over 1,900 major brand
owners and a large number of leading industry associations in connection with intellectual property rights
protection to enhance the effectiveness of anti-counterfeiting measures.
° With government authorities. We cooperate with government authorities, agencies and law enforcement
authorities to conduct ofﬂine anti-counterfeiting investigations, and work with local governments in China to
support original brands. With insights drawn from our data analytics, our team works closely with brands
and law enforcement authorities, to identify manufacturers and large-scale distributors of counterfeit goods
and bring them to justice.
Combatting Fictitious Transactions
With respect to fictitious activities, we have and will continue to invest significant resources in protecting the
trust and credit system we have built on our marketplaces. Measures to prevent, detect and reduce the occurrence
of fictitious transactions on Taobao Marketplace and Tmall we have implemented include:
0 requiring the use of merchants’ real identities when opening accounts;
0 analyzing transaction patterns to identify anomalies;
0 offering dynamic password protection and engaging in real-time monitoring of user login behavior;
0 enabling consumers and merchants to report suspicious transactions;
0 maintaining a “blacklist” of merchants and sellers who have previously been involved in fictitious
transactions; and
0 collaborating with participants in our ecosystem such as Alipay and Cainiao Network as well as industry
partners and law enforcement authorities on Internet security.
Penalties
We aim to protect consumers from being affected by excluding counterfeit merchandise and fictitious
transactions from the ranking system, credit system and transaction volume statistics. When such activities are
confirmed, we penalize the parties involved through a number of means including: limiting the relevant merchant’s
ability to add listings, imposing restrictions on participation in promotional activities on our marketplaces, placing
