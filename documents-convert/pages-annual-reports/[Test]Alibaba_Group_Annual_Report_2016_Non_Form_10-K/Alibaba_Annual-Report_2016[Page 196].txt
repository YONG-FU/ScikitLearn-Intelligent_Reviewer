discussion states definitive legal conclusions under PRC tax laws and regulations, it is the opinion of Fangda
Partners, our special PRC counsel.
Cayman Islands Taxation
The Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains
or appreciation and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty or withholding tax
applicable to us or to any holder of our ADSs and ordinary shares. There are no other taxes likely to be material
to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable on
instruments executed in, or after execution brought within, the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. No stamp duty
is payable in the Cayman Islands on the issue of shares by, or any transfers of shares of, Cayman Islands
companies (except those which hold interests in land in the Cayman Islands). The Cayman Islands is not party to
any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange
control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.
Payments of dividends and capital in respect of our ADSs and ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation
in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder
of our ADSs or ordinary shares, as the case may be, nor will gains derived from the disposal of our ADSs or
ordinary shares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax.
People’s Republic of China Taxation
We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and we gain substantial income by way of
dividends from our PRC subsidiaries. The EIT Law and its implementation rules, both of which became effective
on January 1, 2008, provide that China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC
subsidiary to its equity holders that are non-resident enterprises, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at
a rate of 10%, unless any such foreign investor’s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that
provides for a lower withholding tax rate for which the foreign investor is eligible.
Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with a “de facto management body” within
China is considered a “resident enterprise,” which means that it is treated in the same manner as a Chinese
enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. Although the implementation rules of the EIT Law define “de facto
management body” as a managing body that exercises substantive and overall management and control over the
production and business, personnel, accounting books and assets of an enterprise, the only official guidance for this
definition currently available is set forth in Circular 82 issued by the State Administration of Taxation, which
provides guidance on the determination of the tax residence status of a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated
enterprise, defined as an enterprise that is incorporated under the laws of a foreign country or territory and that
has a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as its primary controlling shareholder. Although Alibaba Group Holding
Limited does not have a PRC enterprise or enterprise group as our primary controlling shareholder and is
therefore not a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise within the meaning of Circular 82, in the
absence of guidance specifically applicable to us, we have applied the guidance set forth in Circular 82 to evaluate
the tax residence status of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and its subsidiaries organized outside the PRC.
According to Circular 82, a Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise will be regarded as a PRC tax
resident by virtue of having a “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income
tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following criteria are met:
0 the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC;
° decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to
approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC;
° the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholders
meeting minutes are located or maintained in the PRC; and
