May 2015, we invested RMB1,500 million in YTO Express representing an equity interest of 12% in the company.
YTO Express is one of the fifteen strategic express courier partners participating in the data platform of Cainiao

Stock Exchange filed an application to purchase all of the equity interest in YTO Express through an asset swap
