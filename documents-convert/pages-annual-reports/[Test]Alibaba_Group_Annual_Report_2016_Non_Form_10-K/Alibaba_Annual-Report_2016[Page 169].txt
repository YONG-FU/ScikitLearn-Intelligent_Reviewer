issuance of the preferred shares to the participants. The maximum number of our ordinary shares redeemable
upon the redemption of the preferred shares issued under this plan by the participants is 15,000,000. The

Partner Capital Investment Plan
We adopted the Partner Capital Investment Plan in 2013 to provide partners of the Alibaba Partnership an
opportunity to invest in interests in our ordinary shares in order to align further their interests with the interests of
our shareholders. Pursuant to the Partner Capital Investment Plan, the partners subscribed for convertible
preferred shares in two special purpose vehicles, PCIP I Limited and PCIP II Limited. These convertible preferred
shares are, for a period of up to four years from the respective dates of issuance thereof, convertible into
exchangeable ordinary shares in these special purpose vehicles, which are exchangeable for our ordinary shares
after eight years following the respective dates of issuance of the convertible preferred shares. The convertible
preference shares and the exchangeable ordinary shares of these special purpose vehicles are subject to forfeiture if
a partner engages in certain activities that compete with us. The maximum number of our ordinary shares that may
be acquired upon the exchange of exchangeable ordinary shares in the special purpose vehicles by the partners is
18,000,000. The underlying ordinary shares have already been issued by us to the special purpose vehicles and are
included in our total outstanding share number. The Partner Capital Investment Plan permits the issuance of
additional shares to the partners as the board may approve from time to time.
