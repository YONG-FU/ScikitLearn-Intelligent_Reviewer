Consolidation Analysis,” which amends the criteria for determining which entities are considered VIEs,
amends the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the

effective for the Company for the year ending March 31, 2017 and interim reporting periods during the year

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,” which
requires debt issuance costs relating to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the consolidated balance

and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet. The new guidance is effective for
the Company for the year ending March 31, 2018 and interim reporting periods during the year ending
