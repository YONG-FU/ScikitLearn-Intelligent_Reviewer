The VIEs did not have any material related party transactions except for those transacted with WFOEs which
were eliminated in these consolidated financial statements and the related party transactions disclosed in
Note 23 or elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements.
Under the contractual arrangements with the VIEs, the Company has the power to direct activities of the
VIEs and can have assets transferred out of the VIEs under its control. Therefore, the Company considers
that there is no asset in any of the consolidated VIEs that can be used only to settle obligations of the VIEs,
except for registered capital and PRC statutory reserves. As all consolidated VIEs are incorporated as limited
liability companies under the Company Law of the PRC, creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the
general credit of the Company for any of the liabilities of the consolidated VIEs.
Currently there is no contractual arrangement which requires the Company to provide additional financial
support to the VIEs. However, as the Company conducts its businesses primarily based on the licenses and
approvals held by its VIEs, the Company has provided and will continue to provide financial support to the
VIEs considering the business requirements of the VIEs, as well as the Company’s own business objectives in
the future.
