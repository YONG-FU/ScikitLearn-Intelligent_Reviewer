NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014, 2015 AND 2016
8. Share-based awards (Continued)
(the “2014 Plan”). Share-based awards are only available for issuance under our 2014 Plan. If an award under
the previous plan terminates, expires or lapses, or is cancelled for any reason, ordinary shares subject to the
award become available for the grant of a new award under the 2014 Plan. On April 1, 2015 and each
anniversary thereof, an additional amount equal to the lesser of (A) 25,000,000 ordinary shares, and (B) such
lesser number of ordinary shares determined by the board of directors will become available for the grant of a
new award under the 2014 Plan. The 2014 Plan has a ten-year term. All share awards granted under the 2014
Plan are subject to dilution protection should the capital structure of the Company be affected by a share
split, reverse share split, share dividend or other dilutive action. The 2014 Plan has substantially similar terms
as the plan adopted in 2011 and other previous plans except that (i) the 2014 Plan is administered by the
compensation committee of the board (or a subcommittee thereof), or such other committee of the board to
which the board has delegated power to act, or the board in absence of any such committee and some
definitions, and (ii) certain terms are adjusted for the purposes of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, US. Securities Act of 1933 and the regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time and
US. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time,
among others. As of March 31, 2016, the number of shares authorized but unissued was 23,050,439 ordinary
shares.
Share options and RSUs granted are generally subject to a four-year vesting schedule as determined by the
administrator of the plans. Under the four-year vesting schedule, depending on the nature and the purpose of
the grant, share options and RSUs in general vest 25% or 50% upon the first or second anniversary of the
vesting commencement date, respectively, as defined in the grant agreement, and thereafter 25% every year.
No outstanding share options or RSUs will be exercisable or subject to vesting after the expiry of a maximum
of six years from the date of grant. Starting from the year ended March 31, 2015, certain share options and
RSUs granted to senior management members of the Company were subject to a six-year pro rata vesting
schedule. No outstanding share options or RSUs will be exercisable or subject to vesting after the expiry of a
maximum of eight years from the date of grant.
Early exercise of share options is allowable under all the aforementioned plans; however, any unvested shares
are subject to repurchase by the Company at the lower of the original exercise price or the fair market value
upon termination of service contracts with the grantees.
