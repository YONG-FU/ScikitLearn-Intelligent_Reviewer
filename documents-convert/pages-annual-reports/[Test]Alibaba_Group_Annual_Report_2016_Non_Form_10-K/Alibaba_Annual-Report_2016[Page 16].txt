We may not be able to maintain and improve the network eﬁects of our ecosystem, which could negatively aﬁect our
business and prospects.
Our ability to maintain a healthy and vibrant ecosystem that creates strong network effects among consumers,
merchants and other participants is critical to our success. The extent to which we are able to maintain and
strengthen these network effects depends on our ability to:
0 offer secure and open platforms for all participants and balance the interests of these participants, including
consumers, merchants, brands, service providers and others;
° provide tools and services that meet the evolving needs of consumers and merchants;
0 provide a wide range of high-quality product, service and content offerings to consumers;
0 provide merchants with a high level of traffic ﬂow with strong commercial intent and effective online
marketing services;
° further enhance the attractiveness of our mobile platform;
0 arrange secure and trusted payment settlement and escrow services;
0 coordinate fulfillment and delivery services with third-party logistics and delivery companies;
0 attract and retain third-party service providers who are able to provide quality services on commercially
reasonable terms to our merchants;
° maintain the quality of our customer service; and
0 continue adapting to the changing demands of the market.
In addition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our ecosystem and balance the needs and interests
of the various participants on our ecosystem may be viewed positively from one participant group’s perspective,
such as consumers, but may have negative effects from another group’s perspective, such as merchants. If we fail to
balance the interests of all participants in our ecosystem, fewer consumers, merchants and other participants may
visit our marketplaces, or they may spend less time, mind share and resources on our websites and conduct fewer
transactions or use alternative platforms, any of which could result in a material decrease in our revenue and
net income.
We may not be able to maintain our culture, which has been a key to our success.
Since our founding, our culture has been defined by our mission, vision and values, and we believe that our
culture has been critical to our success. In particular, our culture has helped us serve the long-term interests of our
customers, attract, retain and motivate employees and create value for our shareholders. We face a number of
challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:
0 failure to identify, promote and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share our
culture, values and mission;
° failure to execute a management succession plan to replace our current generation of management leaders;
0 the increasing size, geographic coverage and cultural diversity of our business and workforce;
0 challenges of effectively incentivizing and motivating employees, including those who have gained a
substantial amount of personal wealth related to share-based incentives;
° competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision and values;
0 the continued challenges of an ever-changing business environment;
° the pressure from the public markets to focus on short-term results instead of long-term value creation;
