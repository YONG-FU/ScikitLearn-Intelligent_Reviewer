Under the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, or the NYSE Manual, U.S. domestic listed
companies are required to have a majority independent board, which is not required under the Companies Law of
the Cayman Islands, our home country. Currently, our board of directors is composed of eleven members, five of
whom are independent directors. In addition, the NYSE Manual requires U.S. domestic listed companies to have a
compensation committee and a nominating/corporate governance committee, each composed entirely of
independent directors, which are not required under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands. Currently, our
compensation committee is composed of three members, only two of whom are independent directors. Our
nominating and corporate governance committee is composed of three members, only two of whom are
independent directors. In addition, the NYSE Manual requires shareholder approval for certain matters, such as
requiring that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material
revisions to those plans, which is not required under the Cayman Islands law. We intend to comply with the
requirements of Cayman Islands law only in determining whether shareholder approval is required.
