ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014, 2015 AND 2016
14. Investment in equity investees (Continued)
During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, the Company completed several investments accounted for
as equity investees. Details of the significant investments are summarized in Note 4.
The Company continually reviews its investments in equity investees to determine whether a decline in fair
value below the carrying value is other than temporary. The primary factors the Company considers in its
determination are the length of time that the fair value of the investment is below the Companyâ€™s carrying
value; the financial condition, operating performance and the prospects of the equity investee; and other
company specific information such as recent financing rounds. If the decline in fair value is deemed to be
other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity investee is written down to fair value. Impairment
charges in connection with the equity method investments of nil, RMB438 million and nil were recorded in
share of results of equity investees in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2014,
2015 and 2016, respectively. Impairment charges in connection with the cost method investments of
RMB119 million, RMB419 million and RMB902 million were recorded in interest and investment income, net
in the consolidated income statements for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The
fair value measurements with respect to such impairment losses were individually insignificant and utilized a
number of different unobservable inputs not subject to meaningful aggregation.
As of March 31, 2016, the equity method investments with an aggregate carrying amount of
RMB42,395 million that are publicly traded have decreased in value and the total open market values of these
investments amounted to RMB38,344 million. A decline in the quoted market price below the carrying
amount is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary. The Company evaluated all
factors and no impairment charge was recognized for these publicly traded equity method investments.
As of March 31, 2015 and 2016, the cost method investments with an aggregate carrying amount of
RMB6,046 million and RMB9,223 million have appreciated in value and the Company estimated the fair value
to approximate RMB14,965 million and RMB25,639 million, respectively. As of the same dates, for certain
other cost method investments with carrying amounts of RMB9,627 million and RMB24,041 million, the
Company identified no events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the
fair values of the investments and determined that it is not practicable to estimate their fair values,
respectively.
