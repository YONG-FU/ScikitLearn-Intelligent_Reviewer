(d) Share-based awards relating to Ant Financial Services
Junhan, the general partner of which is controlled by the executive chairman of the Company and a major
equity holder of Ant Financial Services, made grants of certain share-based awards similar to share
appreciation awards linked to the valuation of Ant Financial Services to a substantial number of employees of
the Company. The vesting of such awards is conditional upon the fulfillment of requisite service conditions to
the Company, and such awards will be settled in cash by Junhan upon the disposal by the holders. Junhan has
the right to repurchase the vested awards from the holders upon an initial public offering of Ant Financial
Services or the termination of the employment of the employees with the Company at a price to be
determined based on the then fair market value of Ant Financial Services. The Company has no obligation to
reimburse Junhan, Ant Financial Services or its subsidiaries for the cost associated with these awards.
For accounting purposes, the cost relating to such share-based awards granted by the shareholder through
Junhan is recognized by the Company as a shareholder contribution as the award will ultimately be settled in
cash by J unhan. The award is accounted for as a financial derivative and initially measured at its fair value,
and the related expense will be recognized over the requisite service period in the consolidated income
statements with a corresponding credit to additional paid—in capital. Subsequent changes in the fair value of
the award are recorded in the consolidated income statements through the date on which the underlying
award is settled by Junhan.
As of March 31, 2016, there were RMB2,542 million of unamortized compensation costs related to these
outstanding share-based awards of Ant Financial Services granted by Junhan, net of expected forfeitures.
These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years.
During the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, the Company recognized expenses of RMB3,788 million
and RMB5,506 million in respect of the share-based awards relating to Ant Financial Services granted by
Junhan, respectively. The expenses recognized for the year ended March 31, 2014 were insignificant.
