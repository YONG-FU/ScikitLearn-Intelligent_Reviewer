Our cost of revenue increased by 44% from RMB23,834 million in fiscal year 2015 to RMB34,355 million
(US$5,328 million) in fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of RMB2,278 million
(US$353 million) in bandwidth and co-location fees and depreciation expenses as a result of our investments in our
cloud computing business and our data platform, increases of RMB2,146 million (US$333 million) in costs
associated with our new business initiatives (mainly our mobile operating system, over-the-top TV services and
entertainment), an increase of RMB1,865 million (US$289 million) in traffic acquisition costs as a result of the
expansion of our third—party affiliate marketing ecosystem and an increase of RMB1,564 million (US$243 million)
in logistics costs mainly relating to fulfillment services provided to us by our affiliate Cainiao Network, which
amounted to RMB2,370 million (US$368 million), or 2% of our revenue, in fiscal year 2016, primarily related to
Tmall Supermarket. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of
revenue would have increased from 26% in fiscal year 2015 to 30% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to increase in
costs associated with our new business initiatives and an increase in logistics costs, as discussed above. As we
continue to invest in new and acquired businesses, customer service initiatives and infrastructure, we expect our
cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollar amounts and will likely increase as a percentage of revenues.

Our product development expenses increased by 29% from RMB10,658 million in fiscal year 2015 to
RMB13,788 million (US$2,138 million) in fiscal year 2016. The increase was largely due to an increase of
RMB3,114 million (US$483 million) in payroll and benefits expenses including share-based compensation expense
(an effect that we expect will continue, as discussed in “Share-based Compensation” above), partially offset by a
decrease in the royalty fee paid to Yahoo, which terminated by contract upon the completion of our initial public
