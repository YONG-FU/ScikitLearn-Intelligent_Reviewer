The unsecured senior notes were issued at a discount amounting to US$24 million (RMB150 million). The
debt issuance costs of US$29 million (RMB175 million) were presented as a direct deduction from the
principal amount of the unsecured senior notes on the consolidated balance sheets. The effective interest rates
for the unsecured senior notes include the interest charged on the notes as well as amortization of the debt
discounts and debt issuance costs.
The unsecured senior notes contain covenants including, among others, limitation on liens, consolidation,
merger and sale of the Company’s assets. In addition, the notes rank senior in right of payment to all of the
Company’s existing and future indebtedness expressly subordinated in right of payment to the notes and rank
at least equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future unsecured unsubordinated
indebtedness (subject to any priority rights pursuant to applicable law).
The proceeds from issuance of the unsecured senior notes were used in full to refinance a previous syndicated
loan in the same amount. The related unamortized upfront fees of RMB830 million of such syndicated loan
were charged to interest expenses on the consolidated income statements upon the repayment of the
syndicated loan during the year ended March 31, 2015.
