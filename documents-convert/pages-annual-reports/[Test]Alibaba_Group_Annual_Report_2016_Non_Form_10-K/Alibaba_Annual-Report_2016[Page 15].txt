If we are unable to compete eﬁectively, our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations would be materially and
adversely aﬁected.
We face increasingly intense competition, mainly from Chinese and global Internet companies as well as
certain offline retailers and e-commerce players, including those that specialize in a limited number of product
categories. We compete to:
0 attract, engage and retain consumers based on the variety and value of products and services listed on our
marketplaces, the engagement of media and entertainment content available on our platforms and the
overall user experience of our products and services;
0 attract and retain merchants based on our size and on the size and the engagement of consumers on our
platforms and the effectiveness of our products and services to help them build brand awareness and
engagement, acquire and retain customers, complete transactions and enhance operating efficiency;
0 compete to attract and retain marketers, publishers and demand side platforms operated by agencies based
on the reach and engagement of our properties, the depth of our consumer data insights and the
effectiveness of our branding and marketing solutions;
° attract other participants of our ecosystems based on access to business opportunities created by the large
scale of economic activity on our platforms, as well as tools and technologies that help them operate and
grow their businesses;
° optimize the usefulness of the data and technologies we provide, including data-enabled customer
relationship management tools, marketing data and data science, media ecosystem for branding, cloud
computing services, omni-channel solutions, the availability of supporting services, including payment
settlement and logistics services, and the quality of our customer service;
° thrive in new industries and sectors as we acquire new businesses and expand, bringing us into competition
with major players in these and other industries and sectors, such as e-commerce service providers in
China’s healthcare industry and media and entertainment providers; and
° attract motivated and effective employees, including engineers and product developers who serve critical
functions in the development of our products and our ecosystem.
In addition, we face increasing competition in the diversified mobile commerce industry for mobile users in China
from established as well as emerging mobile commerce platforms.
Our ability to compete depends on a number of other factors as well, some of which may be out of our
control, including:
0 the timely introduction and market acceptance of the services we offer, compared to those of our
competitors;
0 our ability to innovate and develop new technologies;
0 our ability to maintain and enhance our leading position in retail commerce in China;
° our ability to benefit from new business initiatives; and
0 alliances, acquisitions or consolidations within the Internet industry that may result in stronger competitors.
We face uncertainties and may fail to anticipate competitive conditions as we expand our operations in
overseas markets, including, for example, through our recent acquisition of a controlling stake in Lazada. If we are
not able to compete effectively, the GMV transacted on our marketplaces and the user engagement level and
activity level on our platforms may decrease significantly, which could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations as well as our brand.
