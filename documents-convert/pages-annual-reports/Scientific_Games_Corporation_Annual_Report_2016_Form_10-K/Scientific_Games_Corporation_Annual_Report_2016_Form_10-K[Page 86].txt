(6) Accounts and Notes Receivable and Credit Quality of Notes Receivable
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
and notes receivable is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables. Changes in
circumstances relating to the collectability of accounts and notes receivable may result in the need to increase or decrease our
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable in the future. We determine the allowances based on historical experience,
current market trends and, for larger customer accounts, our assessment of the ability of the customers to pay outstanding
balances. Past due balances and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are
charged against the allowances after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote.
The timing of our invoices do not always coincide with revenue recognized under the contract. We have unbilled
accounts receivable which represent revenue recorded in excess of amounts invoiced under the contract and generally become
billable at contractually specified dates. We had $59.7 million and $62.3 million of unbilled accounts receivable as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Notes receivable
We have provided extended payment terms and development financing to certain customers in the form of notes
receivable. We carry our notes receivable at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts and imputed interest, if any.
Our notes receivable portfolio consists of domestic and international receivables with installment payment terms ranging from
90 days to three years or single payment terms greater than 12 months. Interest income, if any, is recognized ratably over the
life of the note receivable and any related fees or costs to establish the notes are charged to selling, general and administrative
expense as incurred, as they are immaterial. Actual or imputed interest, if any, is determined based on current market rates at the
time the note originated and is recorded in other income and expense, net, ratably over the payment period, which approximates
the effective interest method. We generally impute interest income on all notes receivable with terms greater than one year that
do not contain a stated interest rate.
The interest rates on our outstanding notes receivable ranged from 3.3% to 10.4% at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Our general policy is to recognize interest on notes receivable until the note receivable is deemed non-performing, which we
deÔ¨Åne as a note where payments have not been received within 180 days of the agreed-upon terms. When a note receivable is
