SCIENTIFIC GAMES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
amount of earnings from foreign subsidiaries that have been indefinitely reinvested outside of the US. was $606.9 million as of
December 31, 2016. The determination of the potential net tax liability on repatriations of such amount is not practicable due to
the complexities of the hypothetical calculation. Substantially all of our current year foreign cash ﬂows are not intended to be
indefinitely reinvested offshore, and therefore the tax effects of repatriation of such cash ﬂows are provided for in our financial
reporting. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, $75.0 million and $80.8 million, respectively, of our cash and cash equivalents
were held by foreign subsidiaries. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to US taxation on repatriation.
Unrecognized Tax Beneﬁts
We apply a recognition threshold and measurement attribute related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
taken on our tax returns. We recognize a tax benefit for financial reporting of an uncertain income tax position when it has a
greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. We measure the tax benefit of an
uncertain tax position based on the largest beneﬁt that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized including
evaluation of settlements. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 was $27.4 million. Of this
amount, $27.4 million, if recognized, would be included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Loss and have an impact on our effective tax rate. SGC does not anticipate a material change of its liability for unrecognized
tax benefits before December 31, 2017.
We recognize interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The amount recognized for
interest and penalties during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not material. We had $1.0 million and
$0.8 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We ﬁle income tax returns in the US. federal and various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently
under examination by the IRS for years 2013 and 2014. There are no material state, local, or non-US. income tax examinations
for years prior to 2013.

(22) Litigation
The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including those discussed below. We record an accrual for
legal contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be
reasonably estimated (although, as discussed below, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the accrued liability). We
evaluate our accruals for legal contingencies at least quarterly and, as appr0priate, establish new accruals or adjust existing
accruals to reﬂect (l) the facts and circumstances known to us at the time, including information regarding negotiations,
settlements, rulings and other relevant events and developments, (2) the advice and analyses of counsel and (3) the assumptions
and judgment of management. Legal costs associated with our legal proceedings are expensed as incurred. We had accrued
liabilities of $7.7 million and $16.4 million for all of our legal matters that were contingencies as of December 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively.
