NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
We began integrating SGC and WMS subsequent to the WMS acquisition in October 2013 and began integrating SGC
and Bally subsequent to the Bally acquisition in November 2014 by implementing our plans to streamline our operations and
cost structure. We completed the restructuring actions related to these restructuring plans, and the following table presents a
summary for restructuring charges and the changes in the restructuring accrual during 2015 and 2016, for these restructuring
plans:

On November 3, 2016, we announced that we began implementing a new business improvement initiative, which we
expect will streamline our organization, increase our efficiencies, and significantly reduce our operating costs once the initiative
is fully implemented. These cost savings are expected to be achieved across all our divisions and will encompass a combination
of headcount reductions, facilities streamlining and reduction in other operating costs.
We do not expect to incur additional significant costs related to the November 2016 restructuring plan described
above or any previously announced integration plans.

(5) Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share were the same, as any additional common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive.

per share for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which would be anti-dilutive due to the net loss
in those periods. In addition, we excluded 4.9 million, 5.6 million and 5.0 million RSUs from the calculation of diluted
