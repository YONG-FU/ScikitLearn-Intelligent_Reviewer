(19) Employee Beneﬁt Plans
We have defined benefit pension plans for our U.K.-based union employees (the "UK. Plan") and certain Canadian-
based employees (the "Canadian Plan"). Collectively these two plans are referred to as the "Pension Plans". Retirement benefits
under the UK. Plan are generally based on an employee's average compensation over the two years preceding retirement.
Retirement benefits under the Canadian Plan are generally based on the number of years of credited service. Our policy is to
fund the minimum contribution permissible by the applicable authorities. We estimate that $2.6 million will be contributed to
the Pension Plans in fiscal year 2017.
Our pension benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions
include discount rates, inﬂation, compensation increase rates, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors.
The assumptions used in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are
reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future
expectations to differ from past trends. Differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension
obligations and future expense. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are (1) changes in the
