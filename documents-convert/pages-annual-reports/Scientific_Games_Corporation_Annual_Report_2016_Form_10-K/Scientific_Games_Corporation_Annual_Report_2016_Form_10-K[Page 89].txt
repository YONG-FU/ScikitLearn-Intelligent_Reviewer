We estimate the fair value of notes receivable by discounting expected future cash ﬂows using current interest rates at
which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and remaining maturities. At December 31, 2016
and 2015, the fair value of the notes receivable, net, approximated the carrying value due to contractual terms of notes
receivable generally being under 24 months.
