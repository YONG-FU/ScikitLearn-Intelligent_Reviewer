Senior secured credit facilities
SGC and certain of its subsidiaries are party to a credit agreement dated as of October 18, 2013, by and among SGI, as
the borrower, SGC, as a guarantor, Bank of America, NA, as administrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party
thereto. The credit agreement provided for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion,
consisting of a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which has dollar and multi-currency tranches and a $2.3 billion term B-l
loan facility.
On October 1, 2014, we amended our credit agreement pursuant to which our $300.0 million revolving credit facility
was increased by $267.6 million. In addition, we entered into an escrow credit agreement providing for a $2.0 billion senior
secured incremental term B-2 loan facility (which became an incremental term B-2 loan facility under our existing credit
agreement).
On February 11, 2015, SGI entered into a lender joinder agreement to the credit agreement with an additional
revolving commitment lender. Pursuant to the joinder agreement, the amount of the revolving credit facility under the credit
agreement was increased by $25.0 million to $592.6 million. Up to $350.0 million of the revolving credit facility is available
for issuances of letters of credit.
All of the debt incurred under the credit agreement is subject to accelerated maturity depending on our liquidity at the
time our 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes become due.
The term B-l loans and the term B-2 loans under the credit agreement amortize in equal quarterly installments in an
amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the stated principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. The
new term B-3 loans that were entered into as part of the February 2017 Financing will amortize in equal quarterly installments
in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the stated principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at ﬁnal maturity.
SGI is required to pay commitment fees to revolving lenders on the actual daily unused portion of the revolving
commitments at a rate of 0.50% per annum through maturity, subject to a step-down to 0.375% based upon the achievement of
certain net first lien leverage ratios. SGI may voluntarily prepay all or any portion of outstanding amounts under the credit
facilities at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment
of euro currency loans on a day that is not the last day of the relevant interest period.
Borrowings under the credit agreement are guaranteed by us and each of our current and future direct and indirect
wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (other than SGI, the unrestricted social gaming business entities and immaterial
subsidiaries), subject to certain customary exceptions as set forth in the credit agreement. The obligations under the credit
agreement are secured by a ﬁrst priority lien on (1) substantially all the property and assets (real and personal, tangible and
