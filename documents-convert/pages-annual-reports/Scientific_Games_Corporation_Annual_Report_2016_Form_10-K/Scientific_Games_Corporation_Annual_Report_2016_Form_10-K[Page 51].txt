US. and Canadian shipments encompassed 13,969 replacement units including 1,271 Oregon VLT units (which

International shipments encompassed 11,956 replacement units and 1,474 units for new casino openings and expansions. The
average sales price increased to $16,647 per unit reﬂecting a greater mix of higher-performing premium gaming machines sold

Gamingﬁystems
Gaming systems sales decreased in 2016 due to lower hardware, software and services sales resulting from fewer
large, multi-site opportunities, system replacements and new casino openings in 2016. The decreases were partially offset by a
5% increase in systems maintenance revenue.
Table Products
Table products revenue increased due to increased Shufﬂer sales driven by sales into Asian markets and a 5% increase
in revenue from leased Shufﬂers, PTGs and progressives primarily due to the success of the Blazing 7s BlackjackTM
Progressive.
Operating income
The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of a 2015
goodwill impairment charge; (2) a decrease in overall operating expenses primarily due to realized integration cost synergies
largely implemented in prior periods, including lower SG&A expense of $37.1 million for the year which benefited from $7.5
million of insurance proceeds received in connection with the settlement of a legal matter; and (3) lower D&A expense of
$143.3 million, driven by the non-recurrence of 2015 intangible asset impairments which totaled $128.6 million; partially offset
by (4) a less profitable revenue mix, which was due to an increase in lower-margin Gaming machine sales revenue and a
decline in higher-margin Gaming systems and Gaming operations revenue.
