(21) Income Taxes
Income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the ﬁnancial
reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more
likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.
Management assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable
income will be generated to permit use of existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence
evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Such objective evidence limits
the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, as of
December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of $119.0 million has been recorded to recognize only the portion of the deferred tax
assets that are more likely than not to be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could
be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective
negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence
such as projections for future growth.
We apply a recognition threshold and measurement attribute related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be
taken on our tax returns. We recognize a tax benefit for financial reporting of an uncertain income tax position when it has a
greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. We measure the tax benefit of an
uncertain tax position based on the largest beneﬁt that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being ultimately realized including
evaluation of settlements.
