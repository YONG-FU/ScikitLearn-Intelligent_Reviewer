General
We evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in ASC 605 or ASC 985 , as apprOpriate. Revenue
is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to customers. This condition normally is
met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. Revenue is reported net of incentive rebates,
discounts, sales taxes and all other items of a similar nature. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.
Collectability is evaluated based on a review of the customer's creditworthiness and a review of historic collection experience
under contracts with extended payment terms, as applicable. We separately assess whether pricing is fixed or determinable
under arrangements with extended payment terms reﬂected in the issuance of a note receivable.
The majority of our sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon
delivery of the product or performance of the service. However, to a limited extent SGC also enters into agreements that
involve multiple elements (such as gaming machines, systems hardware and software, installation and service as well as
maintenance and product support), or non-standard terms and conditions.
For non-software multiple-element arrangements, we recognize revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-
alone value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return
rights. The transaction price is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. The selling price used
for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is
not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. ESP is determined in a manner consistent
with that used to establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. In addition to the preceding conditions,
equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon
installation or if installation is essential to the functionality of the equipment. Installation revenues are not recorded until
installation has been completed.
For software elements not essential to functionality of related hardware, we follow the industry specific software
guidance set forth in ASC 985, which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value if such elements remain
undelivered. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established by
