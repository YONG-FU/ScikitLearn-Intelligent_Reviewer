SCIENTIFIC GAMES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
Assets held for sale
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $6.5 million and $16.7 million of assets held for sale, respectively. These
assets held for sale are included within Prepaid expenses, deposits and other current assets and are reported at the lower of the
carrying value or fair market value, less expected costs to sell.
We measured the fair value of assets held for sale under a market approach and have categorized such measurements
as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
(12) Software, net
We capitalize direct costs of services used in the development of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are
amortized over a period of two to ten years on a straight-line basis.
We purchase, license and incur costs to develop external use software to be used in the products we sell or provide to
customers. Costs incurred in creating software are expensed when incurred as R&D until technological feasibility has been
established, after which costs are capitalized up to the date the software is available for general release to customers. Generally,
the software we develop reaches technological feasibility when a working model of the software is available. We capitalize the
payments made for software that we purchase or license for use in our products that has previously met the technological
feasibility criteria prior to our purchase or license. Amortization of capitalized software costs is recorded over the estimated
economic life, which is typically eight to ten years.
For our game themes, we have determined that such products reach technological feasibility when internal testing is
complete and the product is ready to be submitted to gaming regulators for approval. We incur and capitalize regulatory
approval costs for our game themes after technological feasibility is achieved. Amortization of regulatory approval costs is
recorded over the estimated economic life, which is typically two to four years.

(13) Equity Investments
We account for our equity investments where we own a non-controlling interest, but exercise significant inﬂuence,
under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, our original cost of the investment is adjusted
for our share of equity in the earnings of the equity investee and reduced by dividends and distributions of capital received.
We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of the investment may have experienced an "other-than-temporary" decline in value. If such
