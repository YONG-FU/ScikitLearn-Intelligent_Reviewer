LNS
In 2010, we paid $97.7 million (our pro-rata share of the $1,089.8 million LNS paid to obtain this concession) in
upfront fees which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the concession, thereby reducing our investment
balance.
As of December 31, 2016 we had accounts receivable of $13.1 million from LNS.
Northstar Illinois
In August 2015, Northstar Illinois, the State of Illinois, SGI and Gtech entered into a termination agreement with
respect to the PMA (the “Termination Agreement”). The Termination Agreement contemplated, among other things, (1) a $10.0
million net income shortfall payment for the lottery’s 2015 ﬁscal year, (2) termination of the PMA in January 2017 (subject to
possible extension by mutual agreement of the State of Illinois and Northstar Illinois in 3- to 6-month increments), (3) that,
following December 2014, Northstar Illinois will no longer be entitled to any incentive compensation payments and will no
longer be liable for any shortfall payments following the $10.0 million shortfall payment for the lottery's 2015 ﬁscal year, (4)
reimbursement of Northstar Illinois for certain costs it incurs in transitioning its obligations under the PMA, (5) continuation of
our instant lottery game supply agreement (and Gtech’s lottery systems supply agreement) with Northstar Illinois until July
2017, subject to a reduced rate structure, and (6) our right to negotiate a new supply agreement with any manager that replaces
Northstar Illinois and our ability to participate in the procurement process for such replacement manager. In September 2016,
Northstar Illinois, the State of Illinois, SGI and IGT (formerly Gtech) entered into a letter agreement that (a) extended the term
of the PMA to July 2017 and (b) extended our instant lottery game supply agreement (and IGT’s lottery systems supply
agreement) with Northstar Illinois until January 2018.
