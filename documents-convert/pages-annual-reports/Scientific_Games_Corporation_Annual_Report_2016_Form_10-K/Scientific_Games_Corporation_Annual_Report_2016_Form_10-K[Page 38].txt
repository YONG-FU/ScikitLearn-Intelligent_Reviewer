Stockholder Return Performance Graph
The following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return over the five-year period ended December 31,
2016 of our common stock, the Nasdaq Composite Index and indices of our peer group companies that operate in industries or
lines of business similar to ours.
Our peer group companies consist of Aristocrat Leisure Limited (Australian Securities Exchange: ALL), International
Games Technology Plc (New York Stock Exchange: IGT), Intralot, S.A (Athens Stock Exchange: IRLTY), Pollard Banknote
Limited (Toronto Stock Exchange: PBL.UN-TO) and Everi Holdings Inc. (New York Stock Exchange: EVRI).
The companies in each peer group have been weighted based on their relative market capitalization each year. The graph
assumes that $100 was invested in our common stock, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the peer group indices at the beginning
of the five-year period and that all dividends were reinvested. The comparisons are not intended to be indicative of future
performance of our common stock.
