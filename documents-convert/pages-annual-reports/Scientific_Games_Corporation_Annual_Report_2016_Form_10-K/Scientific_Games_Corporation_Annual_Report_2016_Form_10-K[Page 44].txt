Goodwill impairments
During 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of $69.0 million to reduce the carrying value of our International
Lottery Systems reporting unit's goodwill balance to its implied fair value. During 2015, we recorded an aggregate goodwill
impairment charges of $1,002.6 million to reduce the carrying value of our SG Gaming and US. Lottery Systems reporting
units' goodwill balances to their implied fair value. See Note 11 for additional information.
Restructuring and other
Restructuring and other costs increased $35.1 million in 2016 primarily associated with the business improvement
initiative which was announced on November 3, 2016. See Note 4 for additional information.
Other Factors Affecting 2016 Net Loss
Gain on early extinguishment of debt
During the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased and cancelled an aggregate principal amount of $65.9 million of
our 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes for $39.9 million in cash, which resulted in a $25.2 million gain on early extinguishment of
debt
Income tax beneﬁt
We recorded an income tax benefit of $125.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to an income
tax benefit of $299.9 million in 2015. The Company’s 2016 effective tax rate was impacted by the recording of valuation
allowances totaling $37.1 million against domestic (federal and state) net deferred tax assets. For additional information
regarding the changes in our effective tax rates and the variance in our income tax benefit, see Note 21.
Foreign exchange
Our results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates used in the translation of foreign functional
currencies into USD and the re-measurement of foreign currency transactions or balances. The impact of foreign currency
exchange rate ﬂuctuations represents the difference between current rates and prior-period rates applied to current activity. Our
exposure to foreign currency volatility on revenue is as follows:

Other income (expense), net increased due to a $31.1 million change in foreign currency transaction gains and losses
as 2016 results reﬂect a $2.2 million gain compared to a $28.9 million loss in 2015, primarily due to the weakening of the
British Pound Sterling and the Euro.
We also have foreign currency exposure related to certain of our equity investments. Our earnings from our Euro-
denominated equity investment in LNS were $14.0 million and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
