Cost of revenue
Consolidated cost of revenue increased by $2.2 million in 2016, including (1) a $26.7 million increase in cost of unit
shipments in Gaming resulting from the introduction of the TwinStar Dual-Screen and J43 Video gaming machines which
generally carry higher costs at launch and trend lower as they mature; (2) a $48.9 million increase in the cost of Interactive
services primarily related to volume-driven increase in the third party platform fees on the $122.8 million increase in
Interactive revenues, which was offset by; (3) a decrease of $25.1 million in gaming costs primarily associated with placement
of WAP, premium and other leased machines as operators have removed more of these machines from their gaming ﬂoors; (4)
an $11.0 million decrease in costs related to systems and hardware sales; and (5) a $40.7 million reduction in cost of instant
games primarily due to the cancellation of the MONOPOLYTM MILLIONAIRES' CLUB (MMC) game.
SG&A
The increase in SG&A of $9.3 million in 2016 was primarily due to the following: (1) a $34.9 million increase in
marketing primarily driven by Interactive marketing and player acquisition costs related to new games launched in 2016 and
the increased marketing related to our Jackpot Party Social Casino app; (2) a $9.9 million increase in stock-based
compensation, primarily attributable to the accelerated recognition of certain stock based compensation, which was offset by
(3) a $15.4 million decrease in salaries and beneﬁts resulting from headcount actions; and (4) a $21.2 million decrease in
professional and legal fees, which includes a $7.5 million credit related to insurance proceeds received during the second
quarter of 20 16 in connection with the settlement of a legal matter.
R&D
R&D increased by $20.9 million in 2016, primarily driven by higher investments in new product and app development
across each of our business segments.
Depreciation, amortization and impairments
D&A decreased by $164.5 million in 2016 and was primarily due to the following: (1) the non-recurrence of $128.6
million of intangible asset impairment charges recognized in 2015 which reduced the carrying value of two trade name assets to
their fair value; (2) the impact from the expiration of the CSL validation contract in January 2016; and (3) an $11.9 million
impairment of the MMC game studio recognized in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.
