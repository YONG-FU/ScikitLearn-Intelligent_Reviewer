Capitalized installation costs
Certain Participation contracts require us to perform installation activities. Direct installation activities, which include
costs for installing gaming machines, terminals, facilities wiring, computers, internal labor and travel, are performed at the
inception of the contract to enable us to perform under the terms of the contract. Such activities do not represent a separate
earnings process and, therefore, the installation costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected life of the contract, which
we define as the original life of the contract plus all available extensions in the case of lottery-related contracts and typically
over the life of the equipment when no long-term contract exists, as is often the case within our gaming Participation business.
We had $23.7 million and $29.6 million of capitalized installation costs, net of accumulated depreciation, included within
lottery machinery and equipment included within Property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
(9) Acquisitions and Dispositions
Bally acquisition
On November 21, 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Bally for $5.1 billion
(including the refinancing of approximately $1.9 billion of existing Bally indebtedness). We completed the allocation of the
purchase price, which resulted in the purchase price exceeding the aggregate fair value of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities at the acquisition date by $2,95 6.1 million. Such excess amount was recognized as goodwill within our Gaming and
Interactive business segments. We attributed this goodwill to enhanced ﬁnancial and operational scale, market diversification,
opportunities for synergies, assembled workforce and other strategic benefits.
DEQ acquisition
During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding
common shares of DEQ Systems Corp. (DEQ) for approximately $21.0 million in cash. The transaction closed on January 18,
2017. Substantially all of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to acquired intellectual property.
