Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014
Revenue
Consolidated revenue increased in each of our categories of revenues (services, product sales and instant games)
resulting in total revenues increasing by $972.4 million in 2015, despite an $83.2 million unfavorable foreign currency
translation impact. Services and product sales revenue increased by $961.4 million in 2015, primarily due to $1,100.3 million
from the incremental impact of the Bally acquisition reﬂecting a full year of results as compared to the 40 days in 2014 and a
$16.7 million increase in legacy services revenue (service revenues which existed before the Bally acquisition), partially offset
by a decrease of $155.6 million in legacy product sales revenue in our Gaming and Lottery segments. Instant games revenue
increased by $11.0 million from 2014 to 2015.
Services revenue increased by $563.3 million in 2015, primarily reﬂecting a $546.6 million increase in Bally services
revenue (including a full year of results as compared to 40 days in 2014) combined with a net increase of $16.7 million in
services revenue primarily related to increases in our legacy Interactive gaming business partially offset by decreases in our
legacy Gaming business. The impact of Bally service revenue was $63.2 million for the 40-day post-acquisition period in 2014.
Product sales revenue increased by $398.1 million in 2015, primarily reﬂecting a $553.7 million increase in Bally product sales
revenue (including a full year of results as compared to 40 days in 2014), partially offset by a $100.2 million decrease in our
legacy Gaming business primarily due to lower overall demand for gaming machines and a $55.4 million decrease in our
Lottery business primarily due to lower international product sales demand and an unfavorable foreign currency impact. The
impact of Bally product sales revenue was $88.3 million for the 40-day post-acquisition period in 2014. Instant games revenue
increased by $11.0 million in 2015, reﬂecting higher revenue from our US. and international Participation contracts and higher
revenue from our international price-per-unit contracts.
Cost of revenue
Consolidated cost of revenue increased by $254.7 million in 2015, including $332.4 million attributable to Bally
(reﬂecting a full year of results as compared to 40 days in 2014), which was partially offset by a decrease of $77.7 million from
our Lottery and legacy Gaming businesses primarily due to decreased revenues. Cost of revenue attributable to Bally was $52.9
million for the 40-day post-acquisition period in 2014.
Cost of services revenue increased by $89.0 million in 2015 including an incremental $102.0 million attributable to
Bally (reﬂecting a full year of results as compared to 40 days in 2014) and an increase in our legacy Interactive gaming
business of $10.2 million, partially offset by a decrease of $23.2 million primarily due to the lower revenues generated by our
Lottery and legacy Gaming businesses. Cost of services revenue attributable to Bally was $11.0 million for the 40-day post-
acquisition period in 2014. Cost of product sales increased by $131.2 million in 2015, including an incremental $230.3 million
attributable to Bally (reﬂecting a full year of results as compared to 40 days in 2014), partially offset by a decrease of $99.1
million attributable to our Lottery and legacy Gaming businesses, primarily related to the same items that caused the reduction
in revenues as described above. Cost of product sales attributable to Bally was $41.9 million for the 40-day post-acquisition
period in 2014. Cost of instant games increased by $34.5 million in 2015, primarily due to a $35.5 million charge related to
other asset impairments and contract cancellation costs.
SG&A
SG&A increased by $60.0 million in 2015, including an incremental $169.5 million increase attributable to Bally
(reﬂecting a full year of SG&A as compared to 40 days in 2014), which was partially offset by $109.5 million of lower SG&A,
primarily attributable to the legacy Gaming business, which reﬂected the impact of lower legacy revenues, certain acquisition
and legal costs incurred in 2014 and the realization of cost synergies from our acquisitions. The 2014 period included $25.8
million of additional acquisition-related charges related to the Bally acquisition, $24.8 million related to legal contingencies
and settlements and $4.0 million for the write-down of certain receivables from international customers. SG&A attributable to
