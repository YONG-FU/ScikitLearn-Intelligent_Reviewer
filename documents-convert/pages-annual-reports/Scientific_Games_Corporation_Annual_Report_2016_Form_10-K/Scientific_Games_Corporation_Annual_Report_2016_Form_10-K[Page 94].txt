(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
We conduct impairment tests of our indefinite-lived assets annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived
asset is less than its carrying value or when circumstances no longer continue to support an indefinite useful life.
Our annual impairment tests as of October 1, 2016 produced estimated fair values in excess of the carrying values for
all of our remaining indefinite-lived intangible assets.
2016 International Lottery Systems Impairment Charge
Based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for our International Lottery Systems reporting unit, we
recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $69.0 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of $14.5 million, during the fourth
quarter of 2016. The impairment charge resulted from an accumulation of various internal and external factors, including the
loss of our China Sports Lottery validation contract, the inability to receive regulatory approval in 2016 on certain games
resulting in lower than anticipated replacement revenues, and the underlying factors driving the assumptions used in our model
for goodwill valuation purposes, which were based on normalized historical results as described below.
For purposes of the step one test under ASC 350-20, we estimated the fair value of the International Lottery Systems
reporting unit using both an income approach that analyzed projected discounted cash ﬂows and a market approach that
considered comparable public companies. In determining the fair value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit, we
have given equal weight to the income and the market approach.
In calculating the fair value of our International Lottery Systems reporting unit using the income approach, we used
projections of revenues, profit margin, operating costs, capital expenditures and cash ﬂows that primarily considered historical
results, but also considered estimated future results and general economic and market conditions. In developing these
projections, as large system installations and related hardware and terminal sales are inherently unpredictable, we used
normalized historical results, even though such installations have occurred in the past and may reoccur in the future. The
following estimates and assumptions were used in the discounted cash ﬂow analysis:
- A terminal revenue growth rate of 2.0%;
- A terminal profit margin percentage reﬂecting our historical normalized profit margins;
- Assumptions regarding future capital expenditures reﬂective of maintaining and renewing our current customer contracts
under normalized operations; and
- An overall discount rate of 8% based on our weighted average cost of capital for the International Lottery Systems
reporting unit.
As the step one test indicated a possible impairment in the carrying value of our International Lottery Systems
reporting unit goodwill, we performed step two of the impairment test to determine the amount of goodwill impairment to be
recorded. The amount of the impairment was calculated by using assumptions consistent with our step one assumptions
described above and the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill after allocating the fair value determined in the step one
test to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including the fair value of identified intangible assets which are
not included in the existing carrying value of the reporting unit. The International Lottery Systems reporting unit fair value
from our step one test was primarily allocated to our existing recorded assets and liabilities and our unrecorded identified
intangible assets, including our proprietary Lottery systems platform and our existing customer relationships, resulting in an
unallocated excess amount of $22.9 million, which was the implied fair value of the goodwill and was used in determining the
impairment charge. The International Lottery Systems reporting unit is included in our Lottery business segment.
