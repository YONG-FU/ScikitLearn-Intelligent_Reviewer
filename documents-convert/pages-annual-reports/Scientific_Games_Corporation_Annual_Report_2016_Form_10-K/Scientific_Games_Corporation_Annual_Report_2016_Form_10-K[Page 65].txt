Cash ﬂows ﬂom ﬁnancing activities
The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities of $3,340.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015
was due to decrease in net borrowings of $3,536.5 million and an increase in the payment on license obligations of $26.9
million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of deferred financing fees of $163.1 million in 2014, due primarily to the
Bally acquisition, a decrease in contingent earnout payments of $12.7 million, a decrease in common stock repurchases of
$29.5 million and a decrease in net redemptions of common stock of $17.8 million. We made payments on long-term debt of
