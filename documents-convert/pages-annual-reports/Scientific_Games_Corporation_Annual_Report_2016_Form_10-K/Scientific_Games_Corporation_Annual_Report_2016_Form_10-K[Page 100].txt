February 2 01 7 Financing Transactions
On February 14, 2017, we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which provides for a $3,291.0 million
senior secured term B-3 loan facility which matures in 2021 and reduces the commitments on the revolving credit facility to
$556.2 million through October 2018, with a step-down in availability at that time to $381.7 million until the maturity in
October 2020. We also successfully completed an additional offering of our Secured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$1.15 billion (the "additional Secured Notes"). The net proceeds of the term B-3 loan facility and the additional Secured Notes
were used to prepay the balances on the term B-1 and term B-2 loans and the existing revolving credit facility, as well as related
fees and expenses (the "February 2017 Financing"). We plan to use the remaining net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding
2018 Notes including payment of any accrued and unpaid interest thereon plus any related premiums, fees and costs.
Subsequent to the February 2017 Financing, the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes outstanding was $2.1 billion.
