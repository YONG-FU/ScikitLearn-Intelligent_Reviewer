(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
interest at a weighted-average ﬁxed rate of2. 151% and receive interest at the greater of 1% or the prevailing three-month
LIBOR rate. The total notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was $700.0 million as of both December 31, 2016 and
20 15 .
These hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in our future expected cash ﬂows due to the ﬂuctuation in the
three-month LIBOR rate associated with our variable rate debt. The effectiveness of these hedges is measured quarterly on a
retrospective basis. As a result of the effective matching of the critical terms on our variable rate interest expense being hedged
to the hedging instruments being used, we have not measured any hedge ineffectiveness to date. All gains and losses from these
hedges are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) until the future underlying payment transactions occur. Any realized
gains or losses resulting from the hedges will be recognized (together with the hedged transaction) as interest expense. We
estimate the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by discounting the future cash ﬂows of both the fixed rate and variable
rate interest payments based on market yield curves. The inputs used to measure the fair value of our interest rate swap
contracts are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The following table shows the losses (gains) on our interest rate swap contracts:

expense in the next twelve months. The following table shows the fair value of our hedges:
