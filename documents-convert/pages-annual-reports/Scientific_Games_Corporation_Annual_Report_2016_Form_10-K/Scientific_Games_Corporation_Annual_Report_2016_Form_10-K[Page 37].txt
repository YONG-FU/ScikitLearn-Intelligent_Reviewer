Certain holders of our common stock exert significant inﬂuence over the Company and may make decisions that conﬂict
with the interests of other stockholders.
In August 2004, MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (formerly known as MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc.) was
issued approximately 25% of our outstanding common stock in connection with its conversion of our then outstanding Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock. According to a Form 4 filed with the SEC on November 24, 2015, this holder beneficially owns
34,575,737 shares of our common stock, or approximately 39.2% of our outstanding common stock as of February 27, 2017.
Pursuant to a stockholders’ agreement with us, which we originally entered into with holders of the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, such holder is entitled to appoint up to four members of our board of directors and certain actions of our
Company require the approval of such holder. As a result, this holder has the ability to exert significant inﬂuence over our
business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, delaying,
discouraging or preventing a change of control of our Company or a potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or
other business combination.
