amount thereof in a private offering. The 2021 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 4, 2014 (the "2021

2020 and 2021 notes repurchase
During the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased and cancelled $56.5 million and $9.4 million of principal amount
of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes, respectively, for $34.2 million and $5.7 million in cash, respectively, through separate open
market purchases. In connection with these transactions, we recorded a $25.2 million gain on early extinguishment of debt, net
of a $0.8 million charge related to the write-off of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs associated with the
extinguished debt.
Social gaming unrestricted subsidiary designation
In order to provide ﬂexibility for potential future growth opportunities with respect to our social gaming business,
during the third quarter of 2016 we designated certain of our wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, which hold
substantially all of the assets of, and operate, our social gaming business, as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our credit
agreement and each of the indentures governing the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes, 2021 Notes, Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes.
As a result of such designations, these social gaming subsidiaries are not guarantors under our credit agreement and indentures
and are not obligated to comply with many of the covenants set forth in those agreements and that remain applicable to us and
our restricted subsidiaries. In addition, except to the extent of cash distributions from these social gaming subsidiaries to us or
our restricted subsidiaries, the assets, liabilities and financial results of these social gaming subsidiaries will be excluded from
the calculation of the applicable financial metrics required by these agreements, including our credit agreement’s maintenance
