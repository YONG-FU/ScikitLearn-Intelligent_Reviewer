R&D increased by $66.9 million in 2015, including an incremental $81.8 million increase attributable to Bally
(reﬂecting a full year of R&D as compared to 40 days in 2014), which was partially offset by $14.9 million of lower R&D
primarily attributable to the legacy Gaming business which reﬂected the realization of cost synergies from acquisitions. R&D
attributable to Bally was $13.0 million for the 40-day post-acquisition period in 2014.
D&A
D&A increased by $448.9 million in 2015, including an incremental $413.5 million increase attributable to Bally
(reﬂecting a full year of D&A as compared to 40 days in 2014). D&A in the 2014 period included $37.0 million attributable to
Bally for the 40-day post-acquisition period in 2014. D&A also reﬂected charges of $ 169.7 million related to the impact of
impairment charges for certain long-term assets, including $128.6 million in D&A to reduce the carrying values of two trade
name assets to their fair values, $11.5 million in D&A to adjust the carrying value of certain of our facilities to their fair value
less expected selling costs, $12.9 million in accelerated D&A related to gaming operations equipment, $11.9 million in
accelerated D&A of property and equipment related to our instant games business and $4.8 million of other accelerated D&A.
For additional information regarding these charges, see Note 11.
Goodwill impairments
During 2015, we recorded an aggregate goodwill impairment charge of $1,002.6 million, consisting of a $935.0
million non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our SG Gaming reporting unit goodwill to its implied fair
value and a $67.6 million non-cash impairment charge to write off the recorded amount of our US. Lottery Systems reporting
unit goodwill. For additional information regarding these charges, see Note 11.
Restructuring and other
Restructuring and other costs decreased $8.8 million in 2015 to $21.9 million, including $16.9 million related to
employee termination costs following the Bally acquisition and the WMS acquisition, $2.0 million in facility termination costs
and $3.0 million of additional corporate costs unrelated to the Bally acquisition and the WMS acquisition.
Other income and expense
Interest expense increased by $357.7 million in 2015, due primarily to the additional indebtedness that we incurred to
finance the Bally acquisition, reﬂecting a full year of interest expense as compared to 40 days in 2014. For additional
information regarding our indebtedness, see Note 16.
Earnings (loss) from equity investments increased by $24.5 million in 2015, due primarily to the non-recurrence of a
$19.7 million non-cash impairment charge we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 to write down our Northstar
Illinois equity investment and higher overall performance from our equity investments. For additional information regarding
our equity investments, see Note 13.
Loss on early extinguishment in 2014 related primarily to the tender and redemption premiums and related write-off of
deferred financing costs in connection with the reﬁnancing of our 2019 Notes in June 2014.
Other expense increased by $25.6 million in 2015, due primarily to $21.2 million of incremental losses on foreign
currency translation during the year.
Income tax beneﬁt
We recorded an income tax benefit of $299.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to an income
tax benefit of $260.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective income tax rates for the years ended
December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 17.7% and 52.6% respectively. The US. federal tax impact of the non-deductibility of
$935.0 million of our goodwill impairment charges in 2015 was 19.4%.
Our 2015 effective income tax rate on foreign earnings was impacted by the mix of income and the statutory tax rates
in our foreign jurisdictions, which ranged from a low of 0% to a high of 48%. The foreign jurisdictions that had the most
impact on our foreign income tax benefit in 2015 included Australia, Bermuda, Canada, India, Ireland and the UK.
Our income tax beneﬁt may change ﬂom period to period based on, among other factors, the mix of earnings between
US. and foreign jurisdictions and among foreign jurisdictions, the effect of any valuation allowance related to any of our
