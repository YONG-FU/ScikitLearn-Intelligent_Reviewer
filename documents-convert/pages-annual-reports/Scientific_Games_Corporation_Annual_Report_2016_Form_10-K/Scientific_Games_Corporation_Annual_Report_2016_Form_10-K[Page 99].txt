Northstar New Jersey
Northstar New Jersey is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation payments from the State of New Jersey to
the extent the lottery's net income for the applicable year exceeds specified target levels, subject to a cap of 3% of the
applicable year's net income. Northstar New Jersey is responsible for payments to the State of New Jersey to the extent certain
net income targets are not achieved by the New Jersey Lottery, subject to a cap of 2% of the applicable year ’5 net income and a
$20.0 million shortfall payment credit that was fully used by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, pursuant to a
December 2015 amendment to the Northstar New Jersey services agreement, the State of New Jersey will be entitled to
additional amounts for each of the lottery ’5 2016-2018 fiscal years to the extent the sum of the New Jersey Lottery’s net income
and the net income shortfall payments paid to the State of New Jersey by Northstar New Jersey (if any) for the applicable year
fall below certain guaranteed amounts. We may be required to make capital contributions to Northstar New Jersey to fund our
pro rata share of any shortfall payments that are payable to the State of New Jersey under the services agreement.

New Jersey made a $15.4 million payment to the State of New Jersey, of which we contributed our pro rata portion of $2.7
