Table Products
Our table product sales are generated primarily from the sale of products designed to enhance table game speed,
productivity, profitability and security. Our product oﬁerings include various models of Shufflers to suit specific games.
We offer Shufﬂer products under month-to-month lease arrangements that contain Participation rates or ﬁxed monthly
lease rates. These arrangements include service of the product with back-up and replacement products available at the
customer ’s request.
We license our PTG content to commercial, tribal and governmental casino operators typically under month to month
lease arrangements based on fixed monthly rates. PTGs which are designed to enhance operators' table-game operations,
include our internally developed and acquired PTGs, side bets, add-ons and progressive features. Our pr0prietary content and
features are also added to public domain games such as poker, baccarat, pai gow poker, craps and blackjack table games and to
electronic platforms.
Revenues from our Gaming products and services to external customers accounted for 61%, 64% and 45% of our total
revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Current year update
We believe that challenging market conditions impacted our Gaming results during 2016 and could continue in the
near term. These challenges included: (1) restrained investment in new replacement gaming machines by our existing
customers; (2) increased competition for new systems, gaming operations, gaming machines and table products businesses; (3)
political and economic conditions in various locations, including Greece, resulting in a delay in the deployment of our VLTs;
and (4) other economic and regulatory pressures that affect our business operations globally.
For 2017, we expect to continue to face pricing pressure in our Gaming segment. We anticipate that replacement
demand for gaming machines and constraints on capital spending by gaming operators will continue at current levels and that
demand for gaming machines will continue to be negatively impacted by the continued consolidation of casino and other
gaming operators. We anticipate that demand for our gaming systems products and services will continue at current levels due
to fewer large, multi-site installation opportunities, system replacements and new casino openings anticipated in 2017. We have
experienced a decrease in our installed base of WAP gaming machines but anticipate that our installed base of WAP, premium
and daily-fee Participation gaming machines will begin to stabilize, benefiting from the release of a number of new games,
including the launch of our new GameScapeTM cabinet in the third quarter of 2016. The GameScape cabinet, a dedicated
Participation platform, features a player-favorite branded WILLY WONKATM WORLD OF WONKA TM game.
