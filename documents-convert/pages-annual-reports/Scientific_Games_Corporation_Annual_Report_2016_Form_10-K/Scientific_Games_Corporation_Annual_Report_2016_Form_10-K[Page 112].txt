The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the UK. Plan has been determined as a
weighted-average of the expected returns on the above asset classes for the UK. Plan. The expected return on bonds is taken as
the current redemption yield on the appropriate index. The expected return on equities and property is determined by assuming
a measure of outperformance over the gilt-yield. The expected return on cash is related to the Bank of England base rate.
Returns so determined are reduced to allow for investment manager expenses.
The overall expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the Canadian Plan has been determined by
consideration of the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level
of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future
returns of each asset class based on our active management of certain portfolio classes.
We expect beneﬁt payments between $2.3 million and $3.6 million annually, which reﬂect expected future service, for
each of the next five years. Additionally, we expect beneﬁt payments of $24.0 million for benefit payments during the five
years from 2022 - 2026.
