The UK. Plan is closed to new participants and pensionable earnings used to calculate retirement benefits are limited
to a 2% annual increase while the plan is less than 100% funded.
The investment policy is to maximize long-term ﬁnancial return commensurate with security and minimizing risk.
This is achieved by holding a portfolio of marketable investments that avoids over-concentration of investment and spreads
assets both over industries and geographies. In setting investment strategy, the Company considered the lowest risk strategy that
it could adopt in relation to the plan's liabilities and designed the asset allocation to achieve a higher return while maintaining a
cautious approach to meeting the plan's liabilities. The Company considered a full range of asset classes, the risks and rewards
of a range of alternative asset allocation strategies, the suitability of each asset class and the need for appropriate diversification.
The current strategy in the UK. Plan is to hold approximately 28% in a global return fund, approximately 23% in UK.
