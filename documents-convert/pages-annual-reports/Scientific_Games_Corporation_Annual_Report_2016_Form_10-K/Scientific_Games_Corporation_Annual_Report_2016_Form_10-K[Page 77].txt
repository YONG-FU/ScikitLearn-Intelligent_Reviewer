NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
Minimum guarantees
We enter into long-term license agreements with third parties in which we are obligated to pay a minimum guaranteed
amount of royalties, typically annually over the life of the contract. We account for the minimum guaranteed obligations within
accrued and other long-term liabilities at the onset of the license arrangement and record a corresponding licensed asset within
intangible assets, net. The licensed intangible assets related to the minimum guaranteed obligations are amortized over the term
of the license agreement with the amortization expense recorded in D&A. The long-term liability related to the minimum
guaranteed obligations is reduced as royalty payments are made as required under the license agreement. We assess the
recoverability of license agreements whenever events arise or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value of the
licensed asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of the licensed asset and the amount of impairment, if any, are
determined using our policy for intangible assets with finite useful lives.

Other assets
We capitalize debt issuance costs associated with long-term line-of-credit arrangements and amortize such amounts
ratably over the term of the arrangement as an adjustment to interest expense.
We assess the recoverability of our other long-term assets whenever events arise or circumstances change that indicate
the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.

Foreign currency translation
We have signiﬁcant operations where the local currency is the functional currency, including our operations in the
UK, Europe, Australia and Canada. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at period-end rates of exchange
and results of operations are translated at the average rates of exchange for the period. Gains or losses resulting from translating
