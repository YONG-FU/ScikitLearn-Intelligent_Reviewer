NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in USD, table amounts in millions, except per share amounts)
Interactive
Interactive revenues are principally generated from online social gaming. Social gaming revenues are generated from
the sale of virtual coins to players that can be used for additional play or game enhancements. Revenues from player purchases
are recognized ratably over the estimated average service period in which the virtual coins are consumed based on historical
data analysis. Because we are responsible for substantially all aspects of the game services and sale of virtual goods to the
player, we have determined we are the principal and as a result revenues are recorded on a gross basis. Payment processing fees
paid to platform providers (such as F acebook, Apple and Google) on a revenue participation basis are recorded within cost of
services.
Deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue
Deferred revenue arises primarily from the timing differences between the shipment or installation of Gaming and
Lottery equipment and systems products and the satisfaction of all revenue recognition criteria consistent with our revenue
recognition policy, as well as prepayment of contracts which are recognized ratably over a service period, such as maintenance
or licensing revenue. Deferred cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct costs associated with the manufacture of Gaming
and Lottery equipment and systems products for which revenue has been deferred. Deferred revenue and deferred cost of
revenue expected to be realized within one year are classiﬁed as current liabilities and current assets, respectively.
The following table summarizes the deferred revenue activity for the reporting period:

Sales commissions
Any sales commissions associated with the sale or placement of our products are expensed as incurred.
Warranties
At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs. The warranty liability is determined by
applying historical claim rate experience to the current applicable population. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if
actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.
