NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
issued will be based on a graduated slope, with the maximum number of non-vested stock units issuable pursuant to the award
capped at 100% of the base number of non-vested stock units set forth in the award agreement. The Company is required to
estimate the attainment expected to be achieved related to the defined performance goals and the number of non-vested stock
units that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period. Each non-vested
stock unit, upon vesting, represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock. If the performance goals are
not met, no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. The
financial performance goal under these awards was met as of December 31, 2016.
The following table summarizes the Company's non-vested stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2016:

with the Company. Non-vested stock is issued and outstanding upon grant; however, award holders are restricted from selling
the shares until they vest. If the vesting conditions are not met, the award will be forfeited. Compensation expense is measured

over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $9.6 million and $1.4
million of stock-based compensation expense related to these awards. At December 31, 2016, there was approximately $5.3
