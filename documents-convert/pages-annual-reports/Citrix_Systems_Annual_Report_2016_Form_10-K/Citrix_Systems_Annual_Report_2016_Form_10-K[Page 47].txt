General and administrative expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and expenses related to outside
consultants assisting with information systems, as well as accounting and legal fees.
General and administrative expenses increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in stock-based
compensation of $29.9 million and an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs of $17.4 million. These
increases are partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $10.8 million primarily due to fees incurred in connection
with the operational and strategic review of the business in 2015 and the resulting cost reductions from operational eﬁiciencies
in 2016.

facility and depreciation costs of $14.7 million and costs associated with the departure of our CEO of $5.2 million. Partially
offsetting these increases is a charge related to a patent lawsuit of $20.7 million during 2014.
