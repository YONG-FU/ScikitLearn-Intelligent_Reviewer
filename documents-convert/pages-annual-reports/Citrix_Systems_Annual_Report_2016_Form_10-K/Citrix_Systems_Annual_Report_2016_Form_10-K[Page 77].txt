Amortization and impairment of product related intangible assets, which consists primarily of product-related
technologies and patents, was $60.4 million and $131.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and is classified as a component of Cost of net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Amortization
and impairment of other intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships, trade names and covenants not to
compete was $29.2 million and $108.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is classified
as a component of Operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
The Company monitors its intangible assets for indicators of impairment. If the Company determines that an impairment
has occurred, it will write-down the intangible asset to its fair value. For certain intangible assets where the unamortized
balances exceed the undiscounted future net cash ﬂows, the Company measures the amount of the impairment by calculating
the amount by which the carrying values exceed the estimated fair values, which are based on projected discounted future net
cash ﬂows. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company tested certain intangible assets for recoverability due to
changes in facts and circumstances associated with the shift in strategic focus and reduced profitability expectations. As a
result, due to disruptions in the business as a result of the announced plan to explore strategic alternatives, the Company
identified certain definite-lived intangible assets, primarily customer relationships from the acquisition of ByteMobile, that
were impaired within the Enterprise and Service Provider segment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $123.0 million
to write down the intangible assets to their estimated fair value of $26.8 million. Of the impairment charge, $67.1 million is
included in Impairment of other intangible assets and $55.9 million is included in Impairment of product related intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. This non-recurring fair value measurement was categorized as
Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation analysis. Key assumptions used in the valuation include
forecasts of revenue and expenses over an extended period of time, customer retention rates, tax rates, and estimated costs of
debt and equity capital to discount the projected cash ﬂows. Certain of these assumptions involve significant judgment, are
based on management’s estimate of current and forecasted market conditions and are sensitive and susceptible to change,
therefore, further disruptions in the business could potentially result in additional amounts becoming impaired.
Estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets with finite lives as of December 31, 2016 is as follows (in
thousands):
Year ending December 31,
2017 $ 69,792
2018 62,291
