CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Goodwill
The Company accounts for goodwill in accordance with the authoritative guidance, which requires that goodwill and
certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. There was no impairment of goodwill
or indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of the annual impairment analysis completed during the fourth quarters of 2016
and 2015, respectively. The authoritative guidance provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary. The Company performed the qualitative assessment
when it performed its goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of the qualitative analysis, no further
quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary. See Note 3 for more information regarding the Company's acquisitions and
Note 11 for more information regarding the Company's segments.
As part of its continued transformation, effective January 1, 2016, the Company reorganized a part of its business by
creating a new Cloud Services product grouping, which resulted in a change in segment composition. In connection with this
change, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company performed an assessment of its goodwill reporting units and determined
that the Cloud Services reorganization resulted in the identification of three goodwill reporting units (Enterprise and Service
Provider excluding Cloud Services, Cloud Services and GoTo Business). The identification of these reporting units triggered a
reallocation of goodwill as of January 1, 2016 based on the relative fair value approach, however no further quantitative
impairment test was deemed necessary. The Company’s reportable segments remain unchanged.
On January 31, 2017, CitriX completed the separation of the GoTo Business. As a result, the Company is reevaluating its
operating segments in the first quarter of 20 17.
The following table presents the change in goodwill allocated to the Company’s reportable segments during 2016 and
2015 (in thousands):

Intangible Assets
The Company has intangible assets which were primarily acquired in conjunction with business combinations and
technology purchases. Intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is
computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to seven years, except for patents, which are
amortized over the lesser of their remaining life or ten years. In-process R&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an
intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When in-process R&D projects are completed,
the corresponding amount is reclassified as an amortizable intangible asset and is amortized over the asset's estimated useful
life.
