Total cost of net revenues $ 559,541 $ 614,364 $ 620,219 $ (54,823) $ (5,855)
Cost of product and license revenues consists primarily of hardware, shipping expense, royalties, product media and
duplication, manuals and packaging materials. Cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of compensation
and other personnel-related costs of providing technical support and consulting, as well as the costs related to providing our
software as a service offerings, which includes the cost to support the voice and Video offerings in our Communications Cloud
products. Also included in Cost of net revenues is amortization of product related intangible assets and impairment of product
related intangible assets.
Cost of product and license revenues increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to higher sales of our
Delivery Networking products, some of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our software
products. Cost of product and license revenues decreased during 2015 when compared to 2014 primarily due to lower sales of
our Delivery Networking products, some of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other
products. We currently expect cost of product and license revenues will decrease when comparing the first quarter of 20 17 to
the first quarter of 20 16.
Cost of services and maintenance revenues increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in sales
of GoTo Business products of $26.8 million and Cloud Services of $4.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in
implementation services and product training and certification costs of $20.1 million related to our Workspace Services
solutions. Cost of services and maintenance revenues increased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in
sales of our Cloud Services products of $24.7 million, GoTo Business products of $2.9 million, and support and maintenance
costs related to our Workspace Services and Delivery Networking products of $2.9 million. These increases are partially offset
by a decrease in implementation services and product training and certification costs of $15.6 million related to our Workspace
Services solutions. We currently expect cost of services and maintenance revenues, excluding the GoTo Business, will increase
when comparing the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 20 16 consistent with the increase in Software as a Service
revenues, excluding the GoTo Business, and License updates and maintenance revenues as discussed above.
Amortization of product related intangible assets decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower
amortization of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized as a result of impairments during 2015. Amortization of
product related intangible assets decreased during 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower amortization of certain
intangible assets becoming fully amortized as a result of impairments during 2015 and 2014.
Impairment of product related intangible assets decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the
impairments of certain acquired intangible assets in 2015. Impairment of product related intangible assets increased during
2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in impairments related to certain acquired intangible assets in 2015.
