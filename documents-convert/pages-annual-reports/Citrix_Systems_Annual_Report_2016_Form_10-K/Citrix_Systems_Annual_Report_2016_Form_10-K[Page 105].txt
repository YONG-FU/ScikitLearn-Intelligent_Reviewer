18. SEPARATION
The Company announced in November 2015 that it was pursuing a plan to spinoff its GoTo Business into a separate,
publicly traded company. The company established as a result of the spinoff would be made up of the following products and
services: GoToAssist, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToTraining, GoToWebinar, Grasshopper and OpenVoice. The separation
of the GoTo Business, which was intended to be a tax-free spinoff to the Company's stockholders, was expected to be
completed in the second half of 2016. The spinoﬁ was subject to certain conditions, including, among others, obtaining final
approval from the Company's Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion and/or rulings with respect to the tax-free
nature of the transaction for federal income tax purposes and the eﬁectiveness of a Form 10 filing with the SEC.
On July 26, 2016, the Company entered into deﬁnitive agreements with GetGo, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiary
(“GetGo”), and LogMeIn, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“LogMeIn”), with respect to a RMT transaction. Subject to the terms
and conditions of those agreements, (1) the Company will transfer its GoTo Business to GetGo, (2) after which, the Company
will distribute to its stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of GetGo held by the Company, at
the Company ’s sole option, by way of a pro rata dividend or an exchange offer, and (3) immediately after the distribution,
Lithium Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of LogMeIn, will merge with and into GetGo, with GetGo as the
surviving corporation. In connection with the merger, GetGo (which at that time will hold the GoTo Business) will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of LogMeIn, and GetGo’s stockholders will receive an aggregate of approximately 26.9 million
shares of LogMeIn common stock. On August 31, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreements, Citrix notified
LogMeIn that it has elected to effect the distribution through a spin-off. On September 26, 2016, LogMeIn announced the early
termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott—Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act for the merger. The transaction,
