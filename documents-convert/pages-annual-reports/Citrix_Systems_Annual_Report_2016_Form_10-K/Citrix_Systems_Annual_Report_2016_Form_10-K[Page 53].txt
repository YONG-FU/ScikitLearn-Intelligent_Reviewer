We measure our cash ﬂow hedges, which are classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities, at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets (Level 2 inputs).
Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Using Signiﬁcant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)
During 2016, certain cost method investments with a combined carrying value of $1.2 million were determined to be
impaired and have been written down to their fair values of $0.1 million, resulting in impairment charges of $1.1 million.
During 2015, certain cost method investments with a combined carrying value of $3.4 million were determined to be impaired
and have been written down to their fair values of $0.1 million, resulting in impairment charges of $3.3 million. The
impairment charges are included in Other expense, net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. In determining the fair value of cost method investments, we consider many factors
including but not limited to operating performance of the investee, the amount of cash that the investee has on-hand, the ability
to obtain additional financing and the overall market conditions in which the investee operates. The fair value of the cost
method investment represents a Level 3 valuation as the assumptions used in valuing this investment were not directly or
indirectly observable. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10—K for the
year ended December 31, 2016 for further information regarding cost method investments.
For certain intangible assets where the unamortized balances exceeded the undiscounted future net cash ﬂows, we
measure the amount of the impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying values exceed the estimated fair values,
which are based on projected discounted future net cash flows. These non-recurring fair value measurements are categorized as
Level 3 significant unobservable inputs. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for detailed information related to
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Additional Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements
As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the Convertible Notes, which was determined based on inputs that are
observable in the market (Level 2) based on the closing trading price per $100 as of the last day of trading for the year ended
December 31, 2016, and carrying value of debt instruments (carrying value excludes the equity component of our Convertible
Notes classified in equity) was as follows (in thousands):
7 Fair Value Carrying Value 7
Convertible Senior Notes 7$ 1,674,688 $ 1,348,156 7
The carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities
approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these items.

The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 was primarily due to higher
bookings during the year ended December 31, 2016. The activity in our allowance for returns was comprised primarily of $2.1
million of provisions for returns recorded during 2016, partially oﬁset by $1.5 million in credits issued for returns. The activity
in our allowance for doubtful accounts was comprised primarily of $3.3 million of uncollectible accounts written oﬁ", net of
recoveries, partially offset by $0.9 million in provisions for doubtful accounts.
From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or
customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium-sized businesses. If the
financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no individual customers that accounted for over 10% of gross accounts
receivable. For more information regarding significant customers see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included
in this Annual Report on Form 10—K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
