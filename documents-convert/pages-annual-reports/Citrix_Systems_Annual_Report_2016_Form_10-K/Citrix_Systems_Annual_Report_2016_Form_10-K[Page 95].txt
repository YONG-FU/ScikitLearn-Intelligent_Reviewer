13.1% (2.4)% 8.7%
The Company’s effective tax rate generally differs from the US. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to lower tax
rates on earnings generated by the Company’s foreign operations that are taxed primarily in Switzerland.
The Company's effective tax rate was approximately 13.1% and (2.4)% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate when comparing the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended
December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of settling the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination for tax years
2011 and 2012 that closed during 2015. Specifically, during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the IRS concluded its field
examination, ﬁnalized tax adjustments primarily related to transfer pricing and the research and development tax credit, and
formally closed the audit for the 2011 and 2012 tax years. Subsequently, during 2015 the Company recognized a net tax benefit
of $20.3 million related to the IRS examination settlement.
The decrease in the eﬁective tax rate when comparing the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31,
2014 was primarily due to a change in the combination of income between the Company ’s US. and foreign operations, the
decline in reserve for uncertain tax positions, the impact of discrete tax beneﬁts related to the extension of the 2015 federal
research and development tax credit, and the impairment of certain intangible assets.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):
Balance at January 1, 2015 $ 66,918
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 6,613
Additions for tax positions of prior years 4,675
Reductions related to the expiration of statutes of limitations (9,521)
Settlements (14,064)
Balance at December 31, 2015 54,621
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year $ 11,588
Additions for tax positions of prior years 4,759
Reductions related to the expiration of statutes of limitations (1,167)
Balance at December 31, 2016 755 69,801 7
As of December 31, 2016 the Company is offsetting unrecognized tax benefits of $25.1 million against long-term
deferred tax assets. All amounts included in this balance affect the annual eﬁective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest
accrued related to uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax expense. As of the year ended December 31, 2016, the
Company accrued $2.8 million for the payment of interest and penalties.
The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries are subject to US. federal income taxes in the United States, as well as
income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently no longer subject to US. federal income tax
examination. With some exceptions, the Company is generally not under examination for state and local income tax, or non-
