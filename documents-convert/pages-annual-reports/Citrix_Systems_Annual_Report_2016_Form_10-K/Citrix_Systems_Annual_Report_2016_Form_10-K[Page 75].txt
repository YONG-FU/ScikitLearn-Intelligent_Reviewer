CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
periodically reviews these estimated allowances by conducting an analysis of the customer's payment history and credit
worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to
make payments. Based on this review, the Company specifically reserves for those accounts deemed uncollectible. When
receivables are determined to be uncollectible, principal amounts of such receivables outstanding are deducted from the
allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $3.9 million and $6.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. If the financial condition of a significant distributor or customer were to deteriorate, the Company’s operating
results could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no individual customers that accounted for
over 10% of gross accounts receivable.
Inventory
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a standard cost basis, which approximates actual cost. The
Company’s inventories primarily consist of finished goods as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years for computer equipment and software, the lesser of the lease term or ten
years for leasehold improvements, which is the estimated useful life, seven years for office equipment and furniture and the
Company’s enterprise resource planning system and 40 years for buildings.
During 2016 and 2015, the Company retired $220.8 million and $25.8 million, respectively, in property and equipment
that were no longer in use. At the time of retirement, the remaining net book value of the assets retired was not material and no
material asset retirement obligations were associated with them.

Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.
Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash ﬂows resulting from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying
value. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company identified certain intangible assets that were impaired within the
Enterprise and Service Provider segment and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $123.0 million. These non-recurring fair
value measurements were categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation analysis. The
impairment charges are included in Impairment of product related intangible assets and Impairment of other intangible assets in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income. See Note 3 for more information regarding the Company's acquisitions
and Note 5 for more information regarding fair value measurements.
