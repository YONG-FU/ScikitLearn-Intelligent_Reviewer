The weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share does
not include the effect of the potential outstanding common stock from the Company's Convertible Senior Notes (the
"Convertible Notes") and warrants. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of
diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
The Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on its
Convertible Notes on diluted earnings per share, if applicable, as upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the
aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of
common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company ’s election, in respect of the remainder, if
any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being
converted. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted earnings per share when the average market price of
the Company’s common shares for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $90.00 per share. For the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Convertible Notes have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per
share as the effect would be anti-dilutive since the conversion price of the Convertible Notes exceeded the average market price
of the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential
dilutive effect related to the warrants. See Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for detailed information
on the Convertible Notes offering.
