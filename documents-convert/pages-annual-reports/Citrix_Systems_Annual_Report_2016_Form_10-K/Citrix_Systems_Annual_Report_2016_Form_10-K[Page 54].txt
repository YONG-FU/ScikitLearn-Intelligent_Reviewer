Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of
$6.8 billion, of which $500.0 million was approved in January 2017. We may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase
stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve
stockholders’ returns. At December 31, 2016, approximately $404.0 million was available to repurchase common stock
pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated balance
sheets included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. A portion of the funds used to
repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering, as well as
proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit.
We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds through open
market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we expended approximately $28.7 million on open market purchases under
the stock repurchase program, repurchasing 426,300 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $67.30.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we expended approximately $755.7 million on open market purchases,
repurchasing 10,716,850 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $70.52.
In April 2014, in connection with the $1.5 billion increase in repurchase authority granted to us under our ongoing stock
repurchase program, we used approximately $101.0 million to purchase 1.7 million shares of our common stock from certain
purchasers of the Convertible Notes in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the closing of the Convertible Notes
offering discussed above, and an additional $1.4 billion to purchase additional shares of our common stock through our ASR
with Citibank. On April 30, 2014, under the ASR agreement, we paid approximately $1.4 billion to Citibank and received
approximately 21.8 million shares of our common stock, including approximately 2.6 million shares delivered in October 2014
in final settlement in connection with Citibank's election to accelerate the ASR. The total number of shares of our common
stock that we repurchased under the ASR Agreement was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of
our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount.
See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016 for detailed information on our Convertible Notes offering and the transactions related thereto and Note 8
to our consolidated financial statement for detailed information on the ASR.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, we expended approximately $139.9 million on open market purchases,
repurchasing 2,046,400 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $68.36.

During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we withheld 830,155 shares, 679,694 shares and 560,239
shares, respectively, from equity awards that vested. Amounts withheld to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations that
arose on the vesting of equity awards was $66.6 million for 2016, $46.3 million for 2015 and $33.7 million for 2014. These
