NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company expects the total amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts will change significantly in the first quarter of 2017

separation of its GoTo Business and Note 20 for more information on the R&D tax credit.
11. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Enterprise and Service Provider and the GoTo Business segment constitute the Company’s two reportable segments.
The Company does not engage in intercompany revenue transfers between segments. The Company’s chief operating decision
maker (“CODM”) evaluates the Company’s performance based primarily on profitability from its Enterprise and Service
Provider and GoTo Business segment products. The Company's CEO is the CODM. Segment profit for each segment includes
certain research and development, sales, marketing, and services and general and administrative expenses directly attributable
to the segment as well as other corporate costs allocated to the segment and excludes certain expenses that are managed outside
of the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment profit primarily consist of certain restructuring charges, stock-based
compensation costs, charges or benefits related to significant litigation that are not anticipated to be ongoing costs, amortization
and impairment of product related and other intangible assets, net interest and other expense, and separation costs. Accounting
policies of the Company’s segments are the same as its consolidated accounting policies.
As part of its continued transformation, effective January 1, 2016, the Company reorganized a part of its business by
creating a new Cloud Services product grouping that primarily includes the ShareFile product line. Prior to 2016, the ShareFile
product line was included within the Company's Workﬂow Cloud products under the GoTo Business segment. The Company's
CODM has changed how it views the business primarily due to operational initiatives announced in 2015, which include
increased emphasis and investments in core enterprise products for secure and reliable application and data delivery. As a result,
the Company realigned its Cloud Services products and services to the Enterprise and Service Provider segment effective
January 1, 2016 in contemplation of the strategic shift and the separation of the GoTo Business. See Note 18 for more
information on the Company's separation of its GoTo Business. In addition, previously reported segment results have been
recasted to conform to current year presentation.
On January 31, 2017, Citrix completed the separation of the GoTo Business. As a result, the Company will reevaluate its
operating segments in the first quarter of 20 17.
International revenues (sales outside of the United States) accounted for approximately 40.7%, 43.1% and 45.2% of the
Company’s net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
