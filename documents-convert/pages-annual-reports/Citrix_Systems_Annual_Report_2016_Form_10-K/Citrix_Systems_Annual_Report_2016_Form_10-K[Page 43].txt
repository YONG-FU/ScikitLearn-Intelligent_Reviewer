Product and licenses
Product and licenses revenue increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to higher overall sales of our
Workspace Services solutions of $8.3 million and Delivery Networking products of $7.1 million. These increases were partially
offset by lower sales of our non-core products of $8.0 million as a result of our product portfolio rationalization as discussed in
the Executive Summary Overview above. Product and licenses revenue decreased during 2015 when compared to 2014
primarily due to lower overall sales of our Workspace Services solutions of $21.2 million. We currently expect Product and
licenses revenue to decrease when comparing the first quarter of 20 17 to the first quarter of 2016.
Software as a Service
Software as a service revenue increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales of GoTo Business
products of $54.3 million and increased sales of our Cloud Services products of $27.3 million. Software as a service revenue
increased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased sales of GoTo Business products of $51.4 million and
increased sales of our Cloud Services products of $24.7 million. We currently expect our Software as a Service revenue,
excluding the GoTo Business, to increase when comparing the first quarter of 20 17 to the first quarter of 2016.
License updates and maintenance
Effective February 16, 2015, we introduced Software Maintenance across all Citrix software products and discontinued
our existing Premier Support offering. As a result, we have experienced declines in Subscription Advantage and Premier
Support revenues, with a corresponding increase in sales of our software maintenance offerings as customers adopt the new
solution. Additionally, in 2017, our customers began migrating to the new Citrix Customer Success Services offering from the
Subscription Advantage and Software Maintenance programs.
