7. EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLANS
Plans
The Company’s stock-based compensation program is a long-term retention program that is intended to attract and
reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had one
stock-based compensation plan under which it was granting equity awards. The Company is currently granting stock-based
awards from its 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"). In December 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved
the 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2015 ESPP”), which was approved by stockholders at the Company's Annual
Meeting of Stockholders held on May 28, 2015. The 2015 ESPP has replaced the Company's Amended and Restated 2005
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the "2005 ESPP"). In connection with certain of the Company’s acquisitions, the
Company has assumed certain plans from acquired companies. The Company’s Board of Directors has provided that no new
awards will be granted under the Company’s acquired stock plans. The Company’s superseded and expired stock plans include
the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2005 ESPP.
Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, the Company is authorized to grant incentive stock options (“ISOs”), non-qualified
stock options (“NSOS”), non-vested stock, non-vested stock units, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), and performance units
and to make stock-based awards to full and part-time employees of the Company and its subsidiaries or aﬁiliates, where legally
eligible to participate, as well as to consultants and non-employee directors of the Company. SARs and ISOs are not currently
being granted. Currently, the 2014 Plan provides for the issuance of 29,000,000 shares of common stock. In addition, shares of
common stock underlying any awards granted under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, as
amended, that are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise) are added to its shares of common stock
available for issuance under the 2014 Plan. Under the 2014 Plan, NSOs must be granted at exercise prices no less than fair
market value on the date of grant. Non-vested stock awards may be granted for such consideration in cash, other property or
services, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors. Stock-
based awards are generally exercisable or issuable upon vesting. The Company ’s policy is to recognize compensation cost for
awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for
the entire award. As of December 31, 2016, there were 20,068,672 shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to
the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, including authorization under its 2014 Plan to grant stock-based awards
covering 15,584,300 shares of common stock.
Under the 2015 ESPP, all full-time and certain part-time employees of the Company are eligible to purchase common
stock of the Company twice per year at the end of a six-month payment period (a “Payment Period”). During each Payment
Period, eligible employees who so elect may authorize payroll deductions in an amount no less than 1% nor greater than 10%
of his or her base pay for each payroll period in the Payment Period. At the end of each Payment Period, the accumulated
deductions are used to purchase shares of common stock from the Company up to a maximum of 12,000 shares for any one
employee during a Payment Period. Shares are purchased at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock, on either the first business day of the Payment Period or the last business day of the Payment Period, whichever
is lower. Employees who, after exercising their rights to purchase shares of common stock in the 2015 ESPP, would own shares
representing 5% or more of the voting power of the Company’s common stock, are ineligible to continue to participate under
the 2015 ESPP. The 2015 ESPP provides for the issuance of a maximum of 16,000,000 shares of common stock. As of
December 31, 2016, 3,872,661 shares had been issued under the 2005 ESPP. As of December 31, 2016, 974,830 shares have
been issued under the 2015 ESPP. The Company recorded stock-based compensation costs related to its employee stock
purchase plans of $8.8 million, $7.6 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
The Company used the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of its Employee Stock Purchase Plan awards with
the following weighted-average assumptions:
Year Ended Year Ended
December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015
Expected volatility factor 027.041 035
Risk free interest rate 0,25%—0_42% 025%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0%
Expected life (in years) 0.5 0.5
The Company determined the expected volatility factor by considering the implied volatility in six-month market-traded
