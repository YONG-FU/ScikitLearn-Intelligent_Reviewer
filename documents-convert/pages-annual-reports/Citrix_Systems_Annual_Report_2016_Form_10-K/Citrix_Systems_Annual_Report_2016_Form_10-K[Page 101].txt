CITRIX SYSTEMS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
14. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities primarily resulted from cash ﬂow hedges
related to its forecasted operating expenses transacted in local currencies. A substantial portion of the Company ’s overseas
expenses are and will continue to be transacted in local currencies. To protect against ﬂuctuations in operating expenses and the
volatility of future cash ﬂows caused by changes in currency exchange rates, the Company has established a program that uses
foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure to these potential changes. The terms of these instruments, and the
hedged transactions to which they relate, generally do not exceed twelve months.
Generally, when the dollar is weak, foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher, and these higher expenses will
be partially offset by the gains realized from the Company’s hedging contracts. Conversely, if the dollar is strong, foreign
currency denominated expenses will be lower. These lower expenses will in turn be partially offset by the losses incurred from
the Company ’s hedging contracts. The change in the derivative component in Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes
unrealized gains or losses that arose from changes in market value of the effective portion of derivatives that were held during
the period, and gains or losses that were previously unrealized but have been recognized in the same line item as the forecasted
transaction in current period net income due to termination or maturities of derivative contracts. This reclassiﬁcation has no
effect on total comprehensive income or equity.
The total cumulative unrealized loss on cash ﬂow derivative instruments was $3.1 million at December 31, 2016 and $2.3
million at December 31, 2015, and is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. See Note 16 for more information related to comprehensive income. The net unrealized loss as of December 31,
2016 is expected to be recognized in income over the next 12 months at the same time the hedged items are recognized in
income.
Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments
A substantial portion of the Company’s overseas assets and liabilities are and will continue to be denominated in local
currencies. To protect against ﬂuctuations in earnings caused by changes in currency exchange rates when remeasuring the
Company’s balance sheet, it utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its exposure to this potential volatility.
These contracts are not designated for hedge accounting treatment under the authoritative guidance. Accordingly, changes
in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net.
