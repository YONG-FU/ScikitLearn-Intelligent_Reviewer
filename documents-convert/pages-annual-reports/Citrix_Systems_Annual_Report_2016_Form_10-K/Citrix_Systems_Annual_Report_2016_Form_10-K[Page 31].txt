ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to patent infringement claims, including current suits against us or one
or more of our wholly-owned subsidiaries alleging infringement by various Citrix products and services, or the other matters.
We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the allegations made in our pending cases and intend to vigorously defend
these lawsuits; however, we are unable currently to determine the ultimate outcome of these or similar matters or the potential
exposure to loss, if any. In addition, we are a defendant in various litigation matters generally arising out of the normal course
of business. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcomes of these cases, we believe that it is not reasonably possible
that the ultimate outcomes will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash
ﬂows.
ITEM 4. MINE SAFE TY DISCLOSURES
