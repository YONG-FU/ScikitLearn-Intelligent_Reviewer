(1) The amounts in the table above include $86.4 million in exited facility costs related to restructuring activities. In
addition, Citrix will remain liable to the lessor for the duration of certain GoTo Business leases of approximately $6.8
million. The future operating lease obligation in the table above excludes approximately $16.6 million related to the
GoTo Business, since Citrix completed the spin-OE and merger of its GoTo Business with LogMeIn, Inc. on January
3 1, 2017.
(2) During the second quarter of 2014, we completed a private placement of $1.44 billion principal amount of 0.500%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2019. The amount above represents the principal balance to be repaid. See Note 12 to
our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016 for detailed information on the Convertible Notes oﬁering and the transactions related thereto.
(3) Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year-end 2017 of
approximately $18.3 million and a contingent obligation to purchase inventory, which is based on amount of usage, of
approximately $24.5 million.
(4) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where
cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes $69.8 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax
positions recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance, because we could not make reasonably reliable
estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 10 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10—K for the year ended December 31, 2016
for further information.
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long-term
