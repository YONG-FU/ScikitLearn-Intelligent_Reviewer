margin as a percentage of net revenue when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to 2015 including the impairment of

Operating Expenses
Foreign Currency Impact on Operating Expenses
The functional currency for all of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the US. dollar. A substantial majority of our
overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to
ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate
our hedging of currency exchange risks up to 12 months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. When the dollar
is weak, the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially oﬁset by the gain in our hedging
contracts. When the dollar is strong, the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by
the loss in our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the
timeframe for which we hedge our risk.
