NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
options of the Company's common stock based on third party volatility quotes. The Company's decision to use implied
volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the Company's common stock and its assessment that
implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate was
based on a US. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The Company's
expected dividend yield input was zero as it has not historically paid, nor expects in the future to pay, cash dividends on its
common stock. The expected term is based on the term of the purchase period for grants made under the ESPP.
Expense Information under the Authoritative Guidance
As required by the authoritative guidance, the Company estimates forfeitures of stock awards and recognizes
compensation costs only for those awards expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are determined based on historical experience. The
Company also considers whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect its
forfeiture rate quarterly. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted to actual forfeiture experience as needed. The Company recorded
stock-based compensation costs, related deferred tax assets and tax benefits of $184.8 million, $61.5 million and $66.1 million,
respectively, in 2016, $147.4 million, $46.1 million and $52.7 million, respectively, in 2015 and $169.3 million, $46.9 million
and $43.9 million, respectively, in 2014.

Non-vested Stock Units
Performance, Market Performance and Service Condition Stock Units
In January 2016, the Company granted its Chief Executive Officer 220,235 non-vested stock units that vest based on
certain target performance conditions; and in March 2016, the Company granted senior level employees 234,816 non-vested
stock units that vest based on certain target performance conditions. The attainment level under the awards will be based on the
Company's compound annualized total return to stockholders over a three-year performance period, with 100% of such stock
units earned if the Company achieves total shareholder return of 10% over the performance period. Further, if the Company
achieves annualized total shareholder return of less than 10% during the performance period, the awardees may earn all or a
portion of the target award, but not in excess of 100% of such stock units, depending upon the Company’s relative total
shareholder return compared to companies listed in the S&P Computer Software Select Index. If the Company's compound
annualized total shareholder return is 5% or above, the number of non-vested stock units earned will be based on interpolation,
with the maximum number of non-vested stock units earned capped at 200% of the target number of non-vested stock units for
a compound annualized total return to stockholders of 30% over a three-year performance period as set forth in the award
agreement. Within sixty days following an interim measurement period of 18 months, the Compensation Committee will
determine the number of restricted stock units that would be deemed earned based on performance to date, and up to 33% of the
target award may be earned based on such performance; however, any stock units that are deemed earned will remain subject to
continued service vesting until the end of the three-year performance period, or a change in control, if earlier. Within sixty days
following the conclusion of the performance period, the Company’s Compensation Committee will determine the number of
restricted stock units that would vest upon the final day of the performance period based on the Company ’3 performance during
the period and in accordance with the terms of the award. On the vesting date, the greater of the full period restricted stock
units, or the interim earned restricted stock units, will vest in one installment.
In March 2015 and 2014, the Company granted senior level employees non-vested stock unit awards representing, in the
aggregate, 393,464 and 378,022 non-vested stock units that vest based on certain target market performance and service
conditions. The number of non-vested stock units underlying each award will be determined within sixty days of the calendar
year following the end of a three-year performance period ending December 31, 2017 for the March 2015 awards and
December 31, 2016 for the March 2014 awards. The attainment level under the award will be based on the Company's total
return to stockholders over the performance period compared to the return on the Nasdaq Composite Total Return Index (the
"XCMP"). If the Company's return is positive and meets or exceeds the indexed return, the number of non-vested stock units
earned will be based on interpolation, with the maximum number of non-vested stock units earned pursuant to the award
capped at 200% of the target number of non-vested stock units set forth in the award agreement if the Company's return exceeds
