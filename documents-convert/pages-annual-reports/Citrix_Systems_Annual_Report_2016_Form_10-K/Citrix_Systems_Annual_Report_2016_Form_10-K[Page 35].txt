The increase in our Product and licenses revenue was primarily driven by higher overall sales of our Workspace Services
solutions and Delivery Networking products, partially oÔ¨Åset by lower sales of our non-core products. Our Software as a service
revenues increased due to increased sales of GoTo Business products and Cloud Services products. The increase in License
updates and maintenance revenue was primarily due to increased sales of maintenance revenues across our Workspace Services
and Delivery Networking products, partially offset by a decrease in our Subscription Advantage product and our technical and
premier support as customers continue to migrate to our new software maintenance solutions. The decrease in Professional
services revenue was primarily due to decreased implementation services and product training and certification related to our
Workspace Services solutions. We currently expect total revenue, excluding the GoTo Business, to increase when comparing
the first quarter of 20 17 to the first quarter of 2016. In addition, when comparing the 2017 fiscal year to the 2016 fiscal year, we
currently expect total revenue, excluding the GoTo Business, to increase. The increase in 2016 gross margin as a percentage of
net revenue was primarily due to 2015 including the impairment of certain product related intangible assets. The increase in
operating income and diluted earnings per share when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to an increase in revenues
and gross margin, as well as a reduction in operating expenses as a result of our operational initiatives. Also contributing to the
increase in diluted earnings per share was the impact of share repurchases during 2015, which reduced our weighted-average
shares outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate.
Our preliminary outlook for the 2017 fiscal year is for net revenues and expenses to decrease overall compared to the
2016 fiscal year as a result of the separation of the GoTo Business, which was completed on January 31, 2017. In addition, we
currently expect operating income to improve when comparing the 2017 fiscal year to the 2016 fiscal year. In 2017, the GoTo
Business will be accounted for as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
