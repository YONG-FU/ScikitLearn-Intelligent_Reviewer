OPERATIONS
Overview
Citrix delivers solutions to make applications secure and easy to access, anywhere, anytime and on any device or
network. Our mission is to power a world where people, organizations and things are securely connected and accessible.
We market and license our products directly to customers, over the Web, and through systems integrators, or SIS, in
addition to indirectly through value-added resellers, or VARs, value-added distributors, or VADs, original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs and service providers.
We are a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989.
Executive Summary
Our products and services mobilize desktops, apps and data to help our customers drive value. We continue driving
innovation in the datacenter with our products and services across both physical and software defined networking platforms
while powering some of the world’s largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best-in—class application
networking services on a single, consolidated footprint. Our work with Citrix Service Providers, or CSPs, to deliver our
products in the cloud is how we are meeting customer demand for subscription-based services for the delivery of apps from
Windows to web to mobile.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we delivered solid progress on our operational initiatives designed to improve
scalability of our infrastructure and cost saving efficiencies. This included restructuring programs, changes in our field and
channel strategies and continued focus on our core strategy, the secure delivery of apps and data. Our efforts have contributed
to higher operating margins and a foundation for sustained profitable growth of our business.
On January 25, 2017, we announced that our Board approved an increase of $500 million to our existing share repurchase
program, bringing the total current authorization to over $900 million.
On January 31, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our GoTo Business (the “Spin-off”) and subsequent merger of that
business with LogMeIn, Inc. ( “LogMeIn”) pursuant to the terms of (1) an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 26,
2016 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Citrix, GetGo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citrix (“GetGo”), LogMeIn,
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of LogMeIn (“Merger Sub”), and (2) a Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated as of July
26, 2016, by and among Citrix, LogMeIn and GetGo. Under the Spin-oﬁ", we distributed approximately 26.9 million shares of
GetGo common stock to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 20, 2017. We delivered the shares of
GetGo common stock to our transfer agent, who held such shares for the benefit of our stockholders. Immediately thereafter,
Merger Sub was merged with and into GetGo, with GetGo continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of LogMeIn (the
“Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each share of GetGo common stock was converted into the right to receive one share of
LogMeIn common stock. As a result of these transactions, our stockholders received approximately 26.9 million shares of
LogMeIn common stock in the aggregate, or 0.171844291 of a share of LogMeIn common stock for each share of Citrix
common stock held of record by our stockholders as of the close of business on January 20, 2017. No fractional shares of
LogMeIn were issued, and our stockholders instead received cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The distribution of the shares
of GetGo common stock to our stockholders also resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate for our 0.500% Convertible
Notes due 2019 (the “Convertible Notes”) under the terms of the related indenture. As a result of this adjustment, the
conversion rate for the Convertible Notes in effect as of the opening of business on February 1, 2017 was 13.9061 shares of
Citrix common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes.
