The Company’s ﬁxed income available-for—sale security portfolio generally consists of investment grade securities from
diverse issuers with a minimum credit rating of A—/A3 and a weighted-average credit rating of AA-/Aa3. The Company values
these securities based on pricing from the Service, whose sources may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
(Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in
determining fair value, and accordingly, the Company classifies all of its fixed income available-for—sale securities as Level 2.
The Company measures its cash ﬂow hedges, which are classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets and
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets (Level 2 inputs).
