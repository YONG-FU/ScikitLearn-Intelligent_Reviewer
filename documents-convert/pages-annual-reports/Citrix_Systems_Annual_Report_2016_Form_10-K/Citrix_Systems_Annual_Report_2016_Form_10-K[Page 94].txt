The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if it is not more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. At December 31, 2016, the Company determined a
$14.2 million valuation allowance was necessary. The amount disclosed in the table above relates to deferred tax assets for net
operating losses and tax credits that may not be realized.
At December 31, 2016, the Company retained $92.1 million of remaining net operating loss carry forwards in the United
States from acquisitions. The utilization of these net operating loss carry forwards are limited in any one year pursuant to
Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and begin to expire in 2020. At December 31, 2016, the Company held $58.9 million of
remaining net operating loss carry forwards in foreign jurisdictions that do not expire. At December 31, 2016, the Company had
research and development tax credit carry forwards of $6.1 million that begin to expire in 2018.
The Company does not expect to remit earnings from its foreign subsidiaries. All income earned abroad, except for
previously taxed income for US. tax purposes is considered indefinitely reinvested in the Company's non-US. operations and
no provision for US. taxes is provided with respect to such income. As of December 31, 2016 the undistributed earnings of the
Company’s foreign subsidiaries was approximately $2.75 billion and was primarily held by a foreign subsidiary in the United
Kingdom. At this time, it is not practical to determine the amount of tax that may be payable if the Company were to repatriate
those earnings. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to both
US. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries.
A reconciliation of the Company’s effective tax rate to the statutory federal rate is as follows:
