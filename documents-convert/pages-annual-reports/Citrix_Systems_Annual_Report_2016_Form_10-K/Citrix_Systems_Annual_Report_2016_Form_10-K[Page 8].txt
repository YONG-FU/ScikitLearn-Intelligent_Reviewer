- XenDesktop is a fully-integrated, cloud-enabled desktop virtualization solution that gives customers the ﬂexibility to
deliver desktops and applications as a service - from any cloud, on-premises datacenters or both. XenDesktop includes
HDX technologies to give users a high-definition experience - even when using multimedia, real-time voice and video
collaboration, USB devices and 3D graphics content - while consuming less bandwidth than competing solutions.
XenDesktop is available in multiple editions designed for different requirements, from simple VDI-only deployments
to sophisticated, enterprise-class desktop and application delivery services that can meet the needs of everything from
basic call center environments to high-powered graphics workstations. In XenDesktop Enterprise and Platinum
editions, customers also receive the industry-leading Citrix XenApp to manage and mobilize Windows applications.
- XenApp is a widely deployed solution that allows Windows applications to be delivered as cloud services to Android
and iOS mobile devices, Macs, PCs and thin clients. XenApp enables people to work better by running applications in
the security of the data center, or cloud, and using HDX technologies to deliver a superior user experience to any
device, anywhere. XenApp optimizes the application experience for smartphones, tablets and touchscreen laptops,
providing intuitive touch capabilities for the latest generation of devices. Keeping applications under the centralized
control of IT administrators enhances data security and reduces the costs of managing applications on every PC.
XenApp runs on all current versions of Microsoft Windows Server and tightly integrates with the Microsoft Desktop
Optimization Pack, Microsoft App-V, and Microsoft System Center. Our joint solution lowers the cost of delivering
and maintaining Windows applications for all users in the enterprise. The capabilities of XenApp are available
standalone as well as integrated within XenDesktop Enterprise and Platinum editions.
