Cloud Services
In the data sharing segment, our ShareFile product's direct competition includes Dropbox, Box, Syncplicity, BlackBerry's
Watchdox, Accellion, Microsoft and Google, as well as legacy solutions such as traditional file transfer protocol, or FTP. Many
of these competitors have strong brand recognition through consumer and free versions of their products. However, we believe
our ShareFile product offers a superior solution for businesses as it is built specifically for the needs of business. Further, we
believe that our strong reputation in certain vertical segments, along with ShareFile's integration with other Citrix products,
such as Receiver and XenMobile, and our unique ability to store data on-premise or in the Cloud, are key differentiators.
GoTo Business
The GoTo Business segment competed against a host of products oﬁered by a number of established technology players
including Adobe, Google, Apple, Cisco, LMI and Microsoft, and its voice service offerings compete against services provided
by telecom service providers such as Verizon, AT&T, Intercall, PGi, RingCentral, Vonage and BT. Additionally, the GoTo
Business competed against a number of emerging players such as Zoom, HighFive, TeamViewer, Blue Jeans, Intercall, PGi,
Ring Central, Vonage and Splashtop. The GoTo Business also competed against a host of alternative technologies, such as VPN
or cloud-based platforms, and on-premise support options.
Proprietary Technology
Our success is dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property. We have been awarded
numerous domestic and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications in the United States and foreign
countries. Our technology is also protected under copyright laws. Additionally, we rely on trade secret protection and
confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We have established proprietary
trademark rights in markets across the globe, and own hundreds of US. and foreign trademark registrations and pending
registration applications for marks such as Citrix, NetScaler ADC, NetScaler SD-WAN, ShareFile, Xen, XenApp, XenDesktop,
XenServer, XenMobile and many others (including the widely known “GoTo” marks, which were transferred to LogMeIn in
connection with the spin-off and subsequent merger of our subsidiary GetGo with LogMeIn that was completed in January
2017). While our competitive position could be aﬁected by our ability to protect our proprietary information, we believe that
because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industry, factors such as the technical expertise, knowledge and
innovative skill of our management and technical personnel, our technology relationships, name recognition, the timeliness and
quality of support services provided by us and our ability to rapidly develop, enhance and market software products could be
more significant in maintaining our competitive position. See Part I-Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
