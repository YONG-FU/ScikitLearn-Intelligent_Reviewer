Other expense, net is primarily comprised of remeasurement of foreign currency transaction gains (losses), realized losses
related to changes in the fair value of our investments that have a decline in fair value considered other-than-temporary and
recognized gains (losses) related to our investments, which was not material for all periods presented.
The change in Other expense, net when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily driven by a decrease in losses on the
remeasurement and settlements of foreign currency transactions of $5.5 million, decrease in impairment charges of $2.2 million
recognized on cost method investments and an increase in gains recognized on available for sale investments of $1.4 million.
These changes are partially offset by a decrease in gains recognized on cost method investments of $7.0 million.
The change in Other expense, net when comparing 2015 to 2014 is primarily driven by an impairment charge of $5.2
million recognized on cost method investments during 2014 and an increase in gains recognized on cost method investments of
$3.6 million, partially offset by an increase in losses on the remeasurement and settlements of foreign currency transactions of
$5.8 million.
Income Taxes
We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements. We maintain certain strategic management and operational activities in
overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the United States. We do not
expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate was approximately 13.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and (2.4)% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate when comparing
the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the impact of settling the
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination for tax years 2011 and 2012 that closed during 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, our net unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $69.8 million as compared to $54.6
million as of December 31, 2015. All amounts included in this balance affect the annual effective tax rate. As of the year ended
December 31, 2016, we accrued $2.8 million for the payment of interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
