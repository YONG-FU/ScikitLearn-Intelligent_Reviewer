° our products and services may rely on the technology of others and, therefore, require us to obtain intellectual
property licenses from third parties in order for us to commercialize our products or services and we may not be
able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms; and
0 the unauthorized or improperly licensed use of third-party code in our products.
Further, responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity or merit, could result in costly litigation. Further,
intellectual property litigation could compel us to do one or more of the following:
0 pay damages (including the potential for treble damages), license fees or royalties (including royalties for past
periods) to the party claiming infringement;
° cease selling products or services that use the challenged intellectual property;
° obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property to sell or use the relevant technology, which
license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all; or
- redesign the challenged technology, which could be time consuming and costly, or not be accomplished.
If we were compelled to take any of these actions, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be impacted.
Our use of “open source” software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible
litigation.
The products or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called “open source” software,
and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed
by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses, including, for example, the GNU General Public License, the
GNU Lesser General Public License, “Apache-style” licenses, “Berkeley Software Distribution,” “BSD-style” licenses, and
other open source licenses. Even though we attempt to monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting
our products to conditions we do not intend, it is possible that not all instances of our open source code usage are properly
reviewed. Further, although we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for
open source software that we use such that we have not triggered any of these conditions, there is little or no legal precedent
governing the interpretation or enforcement of many of the terms of these types of licenses. If an author or other third party that
distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses,
we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful,
we could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained open source software,
and required to comply with the terms of the applicable license, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our
products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in an unintended manner, under some
open source licenses we could be required to publicly release the source code of our proprietary software, offer our products
that use the open source software for no cost, make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based
upon incorporating or using the open source software, and/or license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of
the particular open source license.
In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of
third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance,
warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software.
If we lose access to third-party licenses, releases of our products could be delayed
We believe that we will continue to rely, in part, on third-party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products. Third-
party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
0 undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person’s code in the third party’s software;
0 disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable and indemnification
protection;
- infringement actions brought by third-parties;
0 that third parties will create solutions that directly compete with our products; and
0 termination or expiration of the license.
If we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under
third-party licenses, it could delay the release of our products. Any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
