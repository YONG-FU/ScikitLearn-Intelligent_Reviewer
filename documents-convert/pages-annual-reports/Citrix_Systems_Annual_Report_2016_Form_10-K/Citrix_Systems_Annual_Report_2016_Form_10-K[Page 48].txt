Restructuring $ 71,122 $ 100,411 $ 20,424 $ (29,289) $ 79,987
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred costs of $45.5 million and $29.7 million primarily
related to our announced plan in November 2015 to simplify our enterprise go-to-market motion and roles while improving
coverage, reﬂect changes in our product focus, and balance resources with demand across our marketing, general and
administration areas. The charges are primarily related to employee severance, outplacement, professional service fees, and
facility closing costs. The majority of the activities related to this program were substantially completed as of the end of the
first quarter of 20 16.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we also recorded charges of $24.0 million and $68.9 million related
to our announced plan in January 2015 to increase strategic focus and operational eﬁiciency. The charges primarily related to
the severance and other costs directly related to the reduction of our workforce and consolidation of leased facilities. The
majority of the activities related to this program were substantially completed by the end of 2015.
The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily related to severance and other costs
directly related to the reduction of our workforce pursuant to a restructuring plan initiated in 2014 to better align resources to
strategic initiatives. For more information, see “r Executive Summary? 7 Overview” and Note 17 to our consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2016.

Separation $ 56,624 $ 6,352 $ * * $ 50,272 $ 6,352
We are incurring incremental costs in connection with the separation of the GoTo Business. These costs relate primarily to
third-party advisory and consulting services, retention payments to certain employees, incremental stock-based compensation
and other costs directly related to the separation of the GoTo Business. Costs related to employee retention or stock-based
compensation are classified on a basis consistent with their regular compensation charges and included within Cost of net
revenues, Research and development, Sales, marketing and services, or General and administrative expense in our consolidated
statements of income as applicable. Costs other than those related to employees are included within Separation expense in our
consolidated statements of income.
During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $56.6 million and $6.4 million related to the separation
of the GoTo Business, primarily for professional services. We expect to incur additional separation costs in 2017 in connection
with the separation of the GoTo Business, the majority of which will be incurred during the first quarter of 20 17. We currently
expect to incur, in the aggregate, approximately $120.0 million to $130.0 million in separation costs, although that estimate is
subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties and the actual amount of separation costs could differ materially from this
estimate. These estimates do not include potential tax related charges or potential capital expenditures which may be incurred
related to the transaction. These additional costs could be significant.
20] 7 Operating Expense Outlook
When comparing the first quarter of 20 17 to the fourth quarter of 20 16, excluding the GoTo Business, we expect
operating expenses to increase in Sales, marketing and services related to go-to market investments to drive growth, while
remaining at consistent levels across the other functional areas. We also expect to incur costs in the first quarter of 2017 related
to the separation of the GoTo Business.
