12. CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES
Convertible Notes Oﬂering
During 2014, the Company completed a private placement of approximately $1.44 billion principal amount of 0.500%
Convertible Notes due 2019. The net proceeds from this oﬁering were approximately $1.42 billion, after deducting the initial
purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the estimated oﬁering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used
approximately $82.6 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of the Bond Hedges described below (after such cost was
partially offset by the proceeds to the Company from the Warrant Transactions described below). The Company used the
remainder of the net proceeds from the offering and a portion of its existing cash and investments to purchase an aggregate of
approximately $1.5 billion of its common stock, as authorized under its share repurchase program. The Company used
approximately $101.0 million to purchase shares of common stock from certain purchasers of the Convertible Notes in
privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the closing of the oﬁering, and the remaining $1.4 billion to purchase
additional shares of common stock through an Accelerated Share Repurchase ("ASR") which the Company entered into with
Citibank, NA. (the “ASR Counterparty”) on April 25, 2014 (the “ASR Agreement”).
The Convertible Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture, dated as of April 30, 2014 (the “Indenture”), between
the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Convertible Notes are the senior
unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 0.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on
April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes will mature on April 15, 2019, unless earlier repurchased or
converted. Upon conversion, the Company will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be
converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of
common stock, at the Company’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the Company’s conversion obligation in excess
of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted.
The conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 11.1111 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of
Convertible Notes, which corresponds to a conversion price of approximately $90.00 per share of common stock. The
conversion rate is subject to adjustment from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to,
the issuance of certain stock dividends on common stock, the issuance of certain rights or warrants, subdivisions, combinations,
