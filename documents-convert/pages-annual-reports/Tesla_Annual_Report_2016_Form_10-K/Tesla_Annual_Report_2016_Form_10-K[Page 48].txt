Energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.9 million, or 1,153%, primarily due to $84.1 million as a result of the
inclusion of revenue from SolarCity from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 through December 31, 2016, as well as an
increase of $82.8 million in energy storage revenue as we ramped up our energy storage sales effort and completed several utility scale
projects such as Southern California Edison Mira Loma substation.

Automotive Segment
Cost of automotive revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs
of tooling and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs
related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive revenues also includes
adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net
realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on—hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well
as warranty expenses recognized as incurred. Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs,
manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and
energy products, costs associated with providing maintenance services, and costs to acquire and certify pre-owned vehicles.
2016 compared to 2015
Cost of automotive revenues increased $1.63 billion, or 62%, to $4.27 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries as a result of a
full year of Model X deliveries as well as increased deliveries for Model S. In addition, the increase is due to product mix as Model X
has a higher cost structure than Model S. The increase in cost of automotive revenue is partially offset by a reduction of warranty
expense of $20.0 million resulting from better vehicle reliability.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $298.6 million, or 163%, to $482.0 million during the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle
deliveries under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year
ended December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $114.3 million in cost of
automotive leasing revenues upon the expiration of resale value guarantees.
Cost of services and other revenue increased $185.5 million, or 65%, to $472.5 million during the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $120.8 million in cost of pre-owned vehicle
sales due to increase in volume, and an increase of $64.9 million in cost to provide maintenance service as our ﬂeet continues to grow.
