As we finalize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, additional purchase price adjustments may be recorded
during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months) in 2017. Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of
judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the
estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash
ﬂows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results of operations. Specifically, we used discounted cash ﬂows model
to value the acquired solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, as well as the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Significant
inputs used for the model included the amount of cash ﬂows, the expected period of the cash ﬂows and the discount rates. The
finalization of the purchase accounting assessment may result in a change in the valuation of asset acquired, liabilities assumed and
taxes may have a material impact on our results of operations and ﬁnancial position.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s estimate of the acquisition-date fair values of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as follows (in thousands):
Assets acquired:
Cash and cash $ 213,523
Accounts receivable 74,619
191,878
Solar energy systems, leased and to be leased 5,781,496
Property, plant and equipment 1,056,312
MyPower notes, net ofcurrent 509,712
Restricted cash 129,196
Intangible assets 356,510
Prepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current 199,864
Total assets $ 8,513,110
Liabilities assumed:
Accounts payable $ 230,078
Accrued liabilities 238,590
Debt and capital leases, current and non-current.......................... 3,403,840
Financing 121,290
Deferred revenue, current and non-current 271,128
Other 950,423
Total liabilities assumed $ 5,215,349
Net assets $ 3,297,761
Noncontrolling interests redeemable and non-redeemable $ 1,066,517
Capped call options associated with 2014 convertible notes (3,460)
Total net assets $ 2,234,704
Gain on acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (88,727)
Total purchase price $ 2,145,977
The total preliminary purchase allocation reﬂects our preliminary estimates and is subject to revision as additional information
in relation to the fair value of the inventories, solar energy systems, leased to be leased, identiﬁable intangible assets, deferred revenue,
deferred taxes, and noncontrolling interests assumed becomes available.
Gain on acquisition
The accounting guidance requires that a gain resulting from the fair value of acquired net assets being greater than the
consideration paid to acquire the net assets be recorded as a gain included in the results of operations on the acquisition date. We
recognized a gain on acquisition of $88.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is recorded in other income (expense), net on
our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and concluded that all acquired
assets and liabilities were recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting estimates of fair values were appropriate. The
primary factor contributing to the gain relates to the change in the overall price of our common stock from the time that the Merger
Agreement was executed on July 31, 2016 to the acquisition date. During this time, our stock price decreased from $230.01 to
$185.04, which in turn reduced the fair value of the consideration.
