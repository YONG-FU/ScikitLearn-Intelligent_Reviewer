goods and raw materials inventory, as well as certain property and equipment, direct lease vehicles, receivables and cash as collateral

Note 14 - Common Stock
In August 2015, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 3,099,173 shares of our common stock for
total cash proceeds of approximately $738.3 million (which includes 82,645 shares or $20.0 million sold to our CEO, net of
underwriting discounts and offering costs).
In May 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold a total of 7,915,004 shares of our common stock for
total cash proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs.
On November 21, 2016, we completed the acquisition of SolarCity (see Note 3) and exchanged 11,124,497 shares of our
common stock for 101,131,791 shares of SolarCity common stock in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Note 15 - Equity Incentive Plans
In 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “20 10 Plan”). The 2010 Plan provides for the granting of stock options,
RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2010 Plan may be either
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees including officers and
directors. Nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and consultants. Generally, our stock
options and RSUs vest over four years and are exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from the date
the stock options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. In
addition, as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity, we have assumed its equity award plans, and its outstanding equity awards as of
the Acquisition Date. The equity awards of SolarCity were converted into equity awards to acquire Tesla common stock in share
amounts and prices based on the Exchange Ratio, with the equity awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as
in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. The vesting and other terms and conditions of the assumed equity awards are
substantially the same as those of the 2010 Plan.
As of December 31, 2016, 4,698,501 of common shares were reserved and available for future issuance under the 2010 Plan.
