*Aggregate intrinsic value in billions
The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between our common stock price and
the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in—the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all
option holders exercised their options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $1.68 billion, $395.6 million and $446.9
million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Fair Value Assumptions
We utilize the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated
the fair value of each option award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table.
Year Ended December 31,
2016 2015 2014
Risk-free interest rate:
1.5% 1.6% 1.9%
Expected term (in years):
6.2 5.4 6.0
Expected volatility:
47% 48% 55%
Dividend yield:
0.0% 0.0% 0.0%
The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon
United States Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our limited history with employee
grants, we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, as
permitted by the SEC Staff, is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
Beginning in 2015, our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded options of our common stock
and the historical volatility of our common stock. Prior to 2015, our expected volatility was derived from our implied volatility on
publicly traded options of our common stock and the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries
related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries, because
we had limited trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to
our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and ﬁnancial leverage of
potential comparable companies. Our historical volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and
combined to produce a single volatility factor.
