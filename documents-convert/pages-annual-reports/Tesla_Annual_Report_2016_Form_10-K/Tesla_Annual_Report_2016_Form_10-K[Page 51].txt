Other income (expense), net, consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our foreign exchange gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the
underlying exchange rates. Additionally, other income (expense), net, includes a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity for the year
ended December 31, 2016.
Other income, net, was $111.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to other expense, net, of $41.7
million during the same period in 2015, representing increases of $152.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we
recognized a gain from the acquisition of SolarCity of $88.7 million and a loss on conversion of our 2018 Notes of $7.2 million. The
remainder of the change in other income (expense), net, was primarily result of ﬂuctuations in gains (losses) from foreign currency
exchange.
Other expense was $41.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to an income of $1 .8 million during the
same period in 2014. Fluctuations in other income (expense) from 2014 to 2015 are primarily the result of gains (losses) from foreign
currency exchange of ($45.6) million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Foreign currency losses
during 2015 related primarily to changes in the exchange rates of euro, Norwegian krone, Canadian dollars, and Chinese yuan.

Our provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $26.7 million, $13.0 million, and
$9.4 million. The increases in the provision for income taxes were due primarily to the increase in taxable income in our international
jurisdictions.
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests
The net loss allocation to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31,
2016 was $98.1 million and was related to SolarCity’s ﬁnancing arrangements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
As of December 31, 2016, we had $3.39 billion in principal sources of liquidity available from our cash and cash equivalents,
which included $2.2 billion of money market funds. This balance included $969.0 million drawn under our asset based line of credit
and $390.0 million drawn under our Warehouse Agreement which we entered into in August 2016 to support the Tesla Finance direct
leasing program. In addition, the balance included $213.5 million of cash assumed as part of the SolarCity acquisition. Amounts held
in foreign currencies had a US. dollar equivalent of $827.1 million as of December 31 2016, and consisted primarily of Euro, Chinese
yuan and Canadian dollars.
Sources of cash are predominately from our deliveries of vehicles, proceeds from retail ﬁnancing activities, and sales of energy
generation and storage products. In addition, through our acquisition of SolarCity, we expect to generate additional liquidity through
the sale of solar energy systems to customers and financing funds created to monetize the cash ﬂows, tax attributes and other
incentives generated by solar energy systems deployed under operating leases or power purchase agreements. We expect that our
current sources of liquidity, including cash and cash equivalents, together with our current projections of cash ﬂow from operating
activities, will provide us with adequate liquidity over at least the next 12 months based on our current plans. We may raise funds in
the future, including through potential equity or debt offerings, subject to market conditions and recognizing that we cannot be certain
that additional funds would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. The amount and timing of funds that we may raise is
undetermined and will vary based on a number of factors, including our liquidity needs as well as access to current and future sources
of liquidity.
These current sources of liquidity and cash ﬂows enable us to fund our ongoing operations and research and development
projects, the initial investments in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned Model 3; the continued construction of
Gigafactory 1; and the expansion of our retail stores, service centers and Supercharger network. We are planning to produce 500,000
total vehicles in 2018, which is approximately double our prior growth plan. We continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs.
We expect to invest between $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion in capital expenditures ahead of the start of Model 3 production in 2017.
