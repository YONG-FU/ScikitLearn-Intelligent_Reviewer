0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 and 2021 and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2019 (2019 Notes) and
$1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 2014, we
issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021
Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our March 2014 public offering. The total net
proceeds from these offerings, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes and $1.36
billion from 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and
the 2021 Notes, and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these notes. In
April 2015, the F ASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which we
retrospectively adopted as of March 31, 2016 and reclassiﬁed debt issuance costs in connection with the notes to related debt liability.
The interest rates are ﬁxed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of
each year, commencing on September 1, 2014.
Each $1,000 of principal of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of
these notes may convert their notes at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020
for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert their notes at their option prior to the respective dates above, only
under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the ﬁscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last
reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive
trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on
each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the
trading price for the applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each day during
such five trading day period; or (3) if we make speciﬁed distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate
transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a
combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021 Notes, we would pay the holders
in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a
portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity
date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if speciﬁc corporate events occur prior to the
applicable maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such a
corporate event in certain circumstances. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or
exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading
days of the quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of December 31,
2016. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible during the first quarter of 2017 and are classified as long-term
debt. Should the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, the 2019 and/or the 2021 Notes will be
convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. As of December 31, 2016, the if-converted value of the
2019 Notes and 2021 Notes did not exceed the principal value of those notes.
As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our 2019 Notes are $788.0 million and $920.0
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our 2021 Notes are $1.08 billion
and $1.38 billion, respectively.
In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option
associated with the notes from the respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of $188.1 million for
the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in stockholders” equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and
2021 Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual
terms of the notes.
