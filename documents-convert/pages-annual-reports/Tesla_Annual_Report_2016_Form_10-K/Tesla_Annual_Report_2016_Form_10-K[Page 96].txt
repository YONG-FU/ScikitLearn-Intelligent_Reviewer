We expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype,
which would be achieved upon the determination by our Board of Directors that an eligible prototype has been completed. Candidates
for such prototype are among the vehicles that we are currently building as part of our ongoing testing of our Model 3 vehicle design
and manufacturing processes.
We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes probable. As of December 31, 2016, we had
$4.9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense for those performance milestones that were considered probable of
achievement and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had unrecognized
compensation expense of $6.1 million for those performance milestones that were not considered probable of achievement. For the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $15.8 million, $10.6 million and
$25.0 million.
Our CEO earns a base salary that reﬂects the currently applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he is
subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not accept his salary.
