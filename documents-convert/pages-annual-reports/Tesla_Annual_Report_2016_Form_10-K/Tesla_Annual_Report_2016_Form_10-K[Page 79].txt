Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(Level 11) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III)
unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy
requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair
value. Our financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents,
marketable securities and interest rate swaps.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at
fair value was as follows, and unrealized gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities presented in the table below for all periods
presented were less than $1.0 million (in thousands):

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified
within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices for identical securities.
Our restricted short-term marketable securities are classiﬁed within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.
We have classified the interest rate swaps within Level 11 because their fair values are determined using alternative pricing
sources or models that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.
