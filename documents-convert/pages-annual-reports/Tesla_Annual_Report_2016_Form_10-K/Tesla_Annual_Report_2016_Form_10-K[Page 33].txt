square feet of office space under a lease that expires in December 2021, with a renewal option. SolarCity also leases a regional
headquarters in Salt Lake City, Utah, and larger offices in San Francisco, San Rafael and Fremont, California. In addition, SolarCity

believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate
our foreseeable future expansion.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Securities Litigation
In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Tesla in US. District Court, Northern District of
California, alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and Rule 10b-5. The complaint made claims against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney’s fees on the basis
of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false and/or misleading representations and omissions, including
with respect to the safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of certain persons who purchased
Tesla’s securities between August 19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the motion of Tesla
and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and thereafter issued a formal written order to that effect. The plaintiffs
appealed from the trial court’s order, and on December 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision dismissing
the complaint with prejudice.
