We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of
revenue recognized. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies and various
local and state government agencies, which are recognized as revenue over the lease term, as well as the fees charged for remote
monitoring service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2016,
deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $268.2 million. As of December 31, 2016, deferred revenue from
rebates and incentives was not material.
