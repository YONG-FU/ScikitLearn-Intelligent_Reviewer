We estimate the fair value of convertible senior notes based on a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based
risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair value of customer
notes receivable, the participation interest, solar asset-backed notes, solar loan-backed notes and Solar Bonds based on rates currently
offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level III). The following table presents their estimated fair values and their
carrying values (in thousands):

$ 2,067,454 $ 1,277,838:
Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our
retail and service center locations, pre-owned Tesla vehicles, and energy storage products.
For solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, we commence transferring component parts from inventory to construction in
progress, a component of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, once a lease contract with a customer has been executed and
installation has been initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within
construction in progress.
We write down inventory as a result of excess and obsolete inventories, or when we believe that the net realizable value of
inventories is less than the carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded write-downs of
$52.8 million, $44.9 million and $15.6 million in cost of revenues.
