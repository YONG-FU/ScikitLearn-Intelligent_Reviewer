Note 23 — Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas
We operate as two reportable segments: automotive and energy generation and storage. The automotive reportable segment
includes the design, development, manufacturing, and sales of electric vehicles. The energy generation and storage reportable segment
includes the design, manufacture, installation, and sale or lease of stationary energy storage products and solar energy systems to
residential and commercial customers, or sale of electricity generated by our solar energy systems to customers.
Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.
