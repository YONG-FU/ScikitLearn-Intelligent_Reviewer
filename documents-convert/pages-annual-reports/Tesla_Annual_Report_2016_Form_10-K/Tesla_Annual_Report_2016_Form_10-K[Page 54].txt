The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2016 certain significant obligations that will affect our future liquidity (in
thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
Total 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter
Operating lease obligations (1) $ 925,977 $ 165,457 $ 150,925 $ 125,148 $ 102,804 $ 88,950 $ 292,693
Capital lease obligations, including interest....... 122,573 38,712 33,730 23,793 7,333 2,746 16,259
Purchase obligations (2)(3) 7,293,507 2,755,762 92,625 79,239 3,871 3,831 15,471
Long-term debt (4)(5) 8,198,241 1,074,553 1,333,675 1,817,434 1,229,656 1,634,897 1,108,026
$16,540,298 $4,034,484 $1,610,955 $2,045,614 $1,343,664 $1,730,424 $1,432,449
(1) The operating lease obligations amount includes $257.5 million recorded as other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets in accordance with built-to-suit accounting.
(2) Amounts do not include future cash payments for purchase obligations which were recorded in Accounts payable or Accrued
liabilities as of December 31, 2016.
(3) These totals represent a quantiﬁcation of aggregate amounts pursuant to purchase orders issued under binding and enforceable
agreements with all vendors as of December 31, 2016, as well as any other estimable and calculable purchase obligations
pursuant to such agreements, including any additional amounts we may have to pay vendors if we do not meet certain minimum
purchase obligations. In cases where no purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements as of
December 31, 2016, we have included estimated amounts based on our best estimates and assumptions or discussions with the
relevant vendors as of such date, and/or amounts or assumptions included in such agreements for purposes of discussion or
reference. In certain cases, such estimated amounts were subject to unsatisfied market conditions and contingent events. Where
the timing of payments are not known or estimable, we have included the amount only in the total column. If contracts where no
purchase orders were outstanding under binding and enforceable agreements were terminated on or prior to December 31, 2016,
our obligations under such contracts would have been substantially lower.
(4) During the fourth quarter of 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of
our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may
convert their notes during the first quarter of 2017. As such, we classified the $205.0 million principal balance of our 2018
Notes as current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016 and have included related contractual
payments in the year ended December 31, 2017 category in the table above.
(5) Long-term debt reported above includes SolarCity’s total consolidated indebtedness of $3.58 billion as of December 31, 2016,
representing outstanding recourse indebtedness of $1.62 billion and non-recourse indebtedness of $1.95 billion. Long-term debt
reported above also includes our remaining non-recourse indebtedness of $457.3 million. Recourse debt refers to debt that is
recourse to the general assets of the debt issuer. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse only to specified assets of the
debt issuer and/or its subsidiaries. SolarCity’s non-recourse credit facilities have been structured to be supported solely by the
solar assets that are pledged as collateral, and, to date, have not experienced any failure to pay such non-recourse indebtedness.
The contractual obligations table above excludes uncertain tax benefits of approximately $198.3 million that are disclosed in
Note 16 in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements because these uncertain tax positions, if recognized, would be an
adjustment to the deferred tax assets.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in
foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the functional currencies of our
foreign subsidiaries and against the US. dollar. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, revenues and expenses may be
significantly impacted and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities,
including intercompany balances. As of December 31, 2016, our largest currency exposures are from the Euro, Japanese yen, and
British Pounds. We recorded foreign exchange gain of $26.1 million in other income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31,
2016 related to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
