2016 compared to 2015
Automotive revenue increased $2.16 billion, or 63% to $5.59 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to a 55% increase in vehicle deliveries to approximately 50,700. The increase in
volume is primarily due to a full year of Model X deliveries in 2016, as well as increased production and sales of Model S. Further,
there was an overall increase in average selling price of 6. 1% primarily due to the introduction of Model X which are higher priced
vehicles compared to Model S. In addition, there is an increase of $133.4 million to $302.3 million of the sale of regulatory credits
from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the corresponding period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by negative impact
from the movement of foreign currency exchange rates.
Automotive leasing revenue increased $452.4 million, or 146%, to $761.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an 83% increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries
under leasing programs and programs with a resale value guarantee from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended
December 31, 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $112.6 million in automotive leasing
revenue upon the expiration of resale value guarantees.
Service and other revenue increased $177.4 million, or 61%, to $468.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $1 17.4 million in pre-owned vehicle sales as we
received more trade-ins and an increase in maintenance service revenue of $66.6 million as our ﬂeet continues to grow.
2015 compared to 2014

automotive revenue and automotive leasing revenue was primarily driven by the ramp in vehicle deliveries.

primarily to increases in pre-owned vehicle sales and maintenance service revenue.
