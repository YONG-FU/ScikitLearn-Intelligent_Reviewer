Weighted average shares used in computing net loss per
share of common stock, basic and diluted 144,212 128,202 124,539 119,421 107,349
(1) Diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed excluding common stock subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive,
potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of stock options
to purchase shares of our common stock, the conversion of our convertible senior notes (using the treasury stock method),
warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in connection with our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, as defined in Note
(1) below, and 2021 Notes, as defined in Note (1) below, (using the treasury stock method), warrants to purchase shares of
our convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock and
convertible notes payable (using the if-converted method). For purposes of these calculations, potential shares of common
stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock as their effect is antidilutive
since we generated a net loss in each period.
(2) We acquired SolarCity on November 21, 2016. The results of SolarCity have been included in our results of operation from
the date of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisition ofSolarCiiy, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
