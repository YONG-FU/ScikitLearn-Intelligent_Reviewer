Construction in progress is comprised primarily of tooling and equipment related to the manufacturing of our vehicles, a portion
of Gigafactory 1 construction, and related capitalized interest. In addition, construction in progress also included certain build-to-suit
lease arrangement for the Buffalo manufacturing facilities acquired through our SolarCity acquisition during the fourth quarter of
2016. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset class and depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended
use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of signiﬁcant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest
on construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, net, and is amortized over the life of the related assets.
During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized $46.7 million and $41.5 million of interest expense, respectively.
We are sometimes involved in construction at our leased facilities primarily related to retail stores, service centers, and certain
manufacturing facilities. In accordance with ASC 840, Leases, for build-to-suit lease arrangements where we are involved in the
construction of structural improvements prior to the commencement of the lease or take some level of construction risk, we are
considered the owner of the assets and land during the construction period. Accordingly, upon commencement of our construction
activities, we record a construction in progress asset and a corresponding financing liability. Once the construction is completed, if the
lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we will remove the asset and related ﬁnancial obligation from the balance sheet and treat
the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria, the
leased property will be treated as a capital lease and included in building and building improvements in the table above.
In addition, as part of the SolarCity acquisition, we assumed a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for
the State University of New York, or the Foundation, for the construction located in Buffalo, New York. See Note 17, Commitment
and contingencies, for Build-to-Suit lease arrangement with the Foundation.
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the table above includes $1.32 billion and $206.1 million of build-to-suit
assets. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, corresponding ﬁnancing obligations of $3.8 million and $1.3 million are
recorded in accrued liabilities and $1.3 billion and $201.3 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities.
Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $477.3 million, $278.7
million and $155.9 million. Total property and equipment assets under capital lease as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $112.6
million and $58.1 million. Accumulated depreciation related to assets under capital lease as of these dates were $40.2 million and
$22.7 million.
We have incurred $825.3 million and $317.5 million of costs for our Gigafactory 1 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
