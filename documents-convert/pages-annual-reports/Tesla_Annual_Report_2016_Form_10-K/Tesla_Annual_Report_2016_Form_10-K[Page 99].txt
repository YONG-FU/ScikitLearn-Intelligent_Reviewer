Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts are classified as income tax expense and was immaterial. As
of December 31, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits of $198.3 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate as the tax
beneﬁts would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate that
the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We ﬁle income tax
returns in the United States, California, various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years 2003 to 2015 remain subject to examination
for federal purposes, and tax years 2003 to 2015 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All net operating losses and
tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for US. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007 to 2015 remain open
for examination in other US. state and foreign jurisdictions.
The United States Tax Court has issued a decision in Altera Corp V. Commissioner related to the treatment of share-based
compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement. As this decision, can be overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any
impact as of December 31, 2016. In addition, any potential tax beneﬁts would increase our deferred tax asset which would be oﬁset
with a full valuation allowance.
