In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the
option to purchase initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a
price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold
warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of
approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds
from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to
offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52
to $184.48 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in
stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and
warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
20 16.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion
price of our 2018 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of such quarter; therefore, holders of 2018 Notes may
convert their notes during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As such, we classified the $196.2 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes
as current liabilities and classified $8.8 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of
$205.0 million and the carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 3 l,
2016. Should the closing price conditions be met in a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the
immediately following quarter.
During fiscal 2016, we repaid $454.7 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes pursuant to conversions by their
holders. As of December 31, 2016, we had remaining outstanding $205.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes. As
of December 31, 2016, there were also outstanding a corresponding amount of convertible note hedge transactions, as well as warrants
to issue up to 2.2 million shares at $184.48 per share as of December 31, 2016, in each case issued in connection with the offering of
the 2018 Notes.
Asset-Based Credit Agreement
In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a
syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”),
which we may draw upon as needed. In October 2015 , lenders increased their total funding commitments to us under the Credit
Facility by up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to certain conditions, for total commitments up to $750 million. In addition, the
Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million swing-line loan sub-facility. The Credit
Agreement is collateralized by a pledge of certain of our accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and availability under the
Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. During fiscal 2016, we amended the Credit
Agreement and increased the availability and the commitments under the Credit Agreement from $750.0 million to $1.2 billion.
Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds
rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. Interest is
payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates, and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020. As
of December 31, 2016, we had $969.0 million borrowings under the Credit Facility and zero borrowings under the swing-line loan
sub-facility.
As of December 31, 2015, we had $135.0 million in borrowings under the Credit Facility.
We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting requirements, such as the completion and
presentation of audited Consolidated Financial Statements for our borrowings. As of December 31, 2016 we were in compliance with
all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.
