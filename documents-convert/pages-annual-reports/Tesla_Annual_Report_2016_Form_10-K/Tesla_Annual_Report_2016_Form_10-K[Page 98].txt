As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.02 billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do
not expect to be realized. The valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $354.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2016. The valuation allowance increase is primarily due to additional U.S. deferred tax assets incurred in the current
year that cannot be realized, inclusive of $169.3 million increase relating to the SolarCity acquisition, and offset by immaterial
valuation allowance releases in foreign jurisdictions. Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely
than not that the US. deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance is required against all US. deferred
tax assets. We have net $33.1 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which we believe are more-likely-than—not to be
fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.34 billion of federal and $3.01 billion of state net operating loss carry-
forwards available to offset future taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 2017 for state
purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity prior to our acquisition and therefore are subject to change of control
provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of
control limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes. The portion of net operating loss carryforwards related
to stock options is approximately $2.39 billion and $1.42 billion for federal and state purposes, respectively, of which the tax benefits
will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, all tax effects related to share-
based payments will be recognized through earnings, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations. We expect that any
potential tax benefits, upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, would increase our deferred tax asset which would be offset with a full
valuation allowance.
We have research and development tax credits of approximately $153.0 million and $163.6 million for federal and state income
tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in various amounts beginning in
2024. However, the state research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other general
business tax credits of approximately $105.5 million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until
2033.
The Company has an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have not
recognized a deferred tax liability for the remittance of any undistributed foreign earnings to the United States as such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States.
Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in
the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We determined that no significant
limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to any prior ownership
changes.
