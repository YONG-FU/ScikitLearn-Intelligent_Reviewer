We are contractually obligated to make certain fund investors whole if they suffer certain losses resulting from the disallowance
or recapture of ITCs or US. Treasury grants. We account for distributions due to the fund investors arising from a reduction of
anticipated ITCs or US. Treasury grants received under distributions payable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable
noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, we had accrued $0.3 million for this
obligation.
Note 19 - Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation
Through December 31, 2016, SolarCity had entered into eight transactions referred to as “lease pass-through fund
arrangements.” Under these arrangements, our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors
through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy
systems are subject to lease or power purchase agreements with customers with an initial term not exceeding 20 years. These solar
energy systems are included under solar energy systems, leased and to be leased — net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The cost of the solar energy systems under the lease pass-through fund arrangements as of December 31, 2016 was $785.3
million. The accumulated depreciation related to these assets as of December 31, 2016 was $2.1 million. The total lease pass-through
financing obligation as of December 31, 2016 was $122.3 million, of which $51.5 million was classified as current liabilities.
