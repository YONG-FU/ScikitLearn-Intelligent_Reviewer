leases for each of the next five years and thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

:$ 3,137,479
The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash
payments were received upfront.
In addition, we assumed through our acquisition of SolarCity and will continue to enter into power purchase agreements with
our customers that are accounted for as leases. These customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed
solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not
included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in the future. Furthermore,
the above table does not include performance-based incentives receivable from various utility companies. The amount of contingent
rentals recognized as revenue for the years presented were not material.
