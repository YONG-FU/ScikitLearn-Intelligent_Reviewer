2. 75% Convertible Senior Notes Due In 2018
In October 2013, SolarCity issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal of 2.75% convertible senior notes due on November 1,
2018 through a public offering.
Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.7838 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $560.64 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of speciﬁed events related to
dividends, tender offers or exchange offers. Holders of the convertible senior notes may convert their convertible senior notes at their
option at any time up to and including the second scheduled trading day prior to maturity. If certain events that would constitute a
make-whole fundamental change, such as significant changes in ownership, corporate structure or tradability of our common stock,
occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible senior notes in
connection with such an event in certain circumstances. The maximum conversion rate is capped at 2.3635 shares for each $1,000 of
principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $423. 10 per share. The convertible
senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible
senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes.
1. 625% Convertible Senior Notes Due in 2019
In September 2014, SolarCity issued $500.0 million and in October 2014, SolarCity issued an additional $66.0 million in
aggregate principal of 1.625% convertible senior notes due on November 1, 2019 through a private placement
Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into 1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $759.36 per share, subject to the same adjustment mechanism as discussed above. The maximum
conversion rate is capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a
minimum conversion price of $573. 10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible
senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain deﬁned fundamental
changes.
In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September 2014 and in October 2014, SolarCity entered into
capped call option agreements to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the convertible senior notes. Specifically,
upon the exercise of the capped call options, we would now receive shares of our common stock equal to 745,377 shares multiplied by
(a) (i) the lower of $1,146. 18 or the then market price of our common stock less (ii) $7 5 9.36 and divided by (b) the then market price
of our common stock. The results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market price of our common stock
exceeds $759.36 and approaches $1,146.18, but we would receive fewer shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds
$1,146.18. Consequently, if the convertible senior notes are converted, then the number of shares to be issued by us would be
effectively partially offset by the shares received by us under the capped call options as they are exercised. We can also elect to
receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares. The capped call options expire on various dates ranging from September 4, 2019
to October 29, 2019, and the formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger; a tender offer; nationalization; insolvency;
delisting of our common stock; changes in law; failure to deliver; insolvency ﬁling; stock splits, combinations, dividends, repurchases
or similar events; or an announcement of certain of the preceding actions. Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued
after a conversion of the convertible senior notes, the capped call options were separately negotiated transactions, are not a part of the
terms of the convertible senior notes, do not affect the rights of the convertible senior note holders and will take effect regardless of
whether the convertible senior notes are actually converted. The capped call options meet the criteria for equity classification because
they are indexed to our common stock and we always control whether settlement will be in shares or cash.

separately presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 21, Related Party Transactions).
