In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we
have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.6 million shares of
our common stock at a price of approximately $359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7
million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment
for certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $5 12.66 for the 2019 Notes
and a total of approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 2021 Notes. We received
$338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional notes in April
2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to
purchase (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at a price
of $5 12.66 per share for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a
strike price of $560.64 per share for the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8
million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended
to reduce potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the
overall conversion price ﬁom $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to
$560.64 in the case of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note
hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection
with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.
1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from
the offering, after deducting transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt issuance costs in
connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes and are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the
contractual term of the 2018 Notes. The interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in
arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013.
Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes is initially convertible into 8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent
to an initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at their option on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes
may convert their 2018 Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal
quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following
any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2018 Notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing
sale price of our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of
our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal
amount of the 2018 Notes and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion
of such shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the
maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a repurchase
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate
events occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in
connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances.
As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our 2018 Notes are $612.5 million and $659.8
million, respectively.
In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we valued and bifurcated the conversion option
associated with the 2018 Notes from the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in stockholders’
equity. The resulting debt discount on the 2018 Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29% over
the contractual term of the 2018 Notes.
