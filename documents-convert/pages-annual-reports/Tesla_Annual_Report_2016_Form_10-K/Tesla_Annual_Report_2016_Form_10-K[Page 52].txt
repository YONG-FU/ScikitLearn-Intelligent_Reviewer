As part of the SolarCity acquisition, we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately $5.0 billion in combined capital,
operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period following full production
at Gigafactory 2. We anticipate meeting these obligations through our operations at Gigafactory 2 and other operations within the
State of New York over the 10-year term of the agreement, and we do not believe that we face a significant risk of default.

Cash F lows from Operating Activities
Our cash ﬂows from operating activities are signiﬁcantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business
in areas such as manufacturing, research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash ﬂows are also
affected by our working capital needs to support growth and ﬂuctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts
payable and other current assets and liabilities.
Our operating cash inﬂows include cash from sales and leases of our vehicles, customer deposits for vehicles, including Model
3, sales of regulatory credits, sales of powertrain components and systems, and energy generation and storage products. These cash
inﬂows are offset by payments we make to our suppliers for production materials and parts used in our manufacturing process,
employee compensation, operating leases and interest expense on our ﬂnancings.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in operating activities was $123.8 million and was primarily a result of net
loss incurred of $773.0 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $750.6 million as our business expands, an
increase in deferred revenue of $383.0 million as the number of vehicle deliveries with resale value guarantee increased, an increase in
customer deposits of 388.4 million primarily as a result of Model 3 reservations and an increase in resale value guarantees of $326.9
million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in inventories and operating lease vehicles of $2.47 billion as we expand
our program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantees. Cash used in operating activities also included non-cash
adjustments of $1.34 billion, which primarily consisted of depreciation expense of $947.1 million and stock-based compensation of
$334.2 million. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized a gain of $88.7 million related to the SolarCity
acquisition.
