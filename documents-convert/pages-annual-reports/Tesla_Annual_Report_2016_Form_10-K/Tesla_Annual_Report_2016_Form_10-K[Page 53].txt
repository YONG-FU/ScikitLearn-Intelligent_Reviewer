During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in operating activities was $524.5 million and was primarily a result of net
loss incurred of $888.7 million, and an increase of inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.57 billion as we expanded our
program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in resale value
guarantees of $442.3 million and deferred revenue of $322.2 million as the number vehicles with resale value guarantee increased.
Cash used by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $857.5 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in operating activities was $57.3 million and was primarily a result of net
loss incurred of $294.0 million, and an increase of inventories and operating lease vehicles of $1.05 billion as we expanded our
program for direct lease and vehicles with resale value guarantee. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in resale value
guarantee of $249.5 million and deferred revenue of $209.7 million as the number vehicles with resale value guarantee increased.
Cash used by operating activities also included non-cash adjustments of $493.5 million. The decrease in operating cash ﬂows in 2015
as compared to 2014 was due to an increase in overall inventory to support growth, and increase in operating lease vehicles, partially
offset by proceeds from sales, and higher operating expenses in R&D and SG&A.
Cash F lows from Investing Activities
Cash ﬂows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations, including
investments in manufacturing equipment and tooling, the continued construction of our Gigafactory, and our stores, service centers
and Supercharger network infrastructure. Cash used in investing activities was $1.42 billion, $1.67 billion and $990.4 million for the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash ﬂows from investing activities and variability between each year related
primarily to capital expenditures, which were $1.28 billion, $1.63 billion and $969.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, we
increased our restricted cash of $206.1 million as a result of the assumed restricted cash from the SolarCity acquisition. The decreases
in cash ﬂows from investing activities in 2016 was partially offset by the assumed cash of $213.5 million as a result of the SolarCity
acquisition.
In 2014, we began construction of Gigafactory l in Nevada. In 2016, we used cash of $455.3 million towards Gigafactory 1
construction and expect to spend a total of approximately $770.0 million during 2017.
Cash F lows from Financing Activities

billion and $2.14 billion. Cash ﬂows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of $1 .70
billion net proceeds from our May 2016 public offering of 7,915,004 shares of common stock, $995.4 million of proceeds ﬁom
issuance of debt, net of repayments, and proceeds from collateralized borrowing of $769.7 million. The net proceeds from issuance of
debt during 2016 primarily consisted of the following: $834.0 million of net borrowing under the Asset-Based Credit Facility, $390.0
million borrowing under the Warehouse Agreement Facility, partially offset by settlement of $454.7 million for certain conversion of
our 2018 Notes. Further, we also received $201.5 million of proceeds from investment by fund investors and paid distributions to
fund investors of $21.3 million.
Cash ﬂows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $738.3 million net

our bank leasing partners. The decrease in cash provided from financing in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to $2.1
billion in net proceeds received in 2014 from the issuance of our 2019 and 2021 Notes.
