Gross profit for the Automotive segment increased from $921.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.60 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2016. Automotive gross margin increased from 22.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, to
23.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower material and manufacturing costs as we
further improve our production processes, partially offset by a negative impact from the movement in foreign exchange and increased
expenditures to build out our service centers and provide maintenance.
2015 Compared to 2014
Cost of automotive revenues increased $581.6 million, or 28%, to $2.64 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015
compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in cost of automotive revenues was driven primarily by increased
Model S deliveries.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue increased $96.0 million, or 110%, to $183.4 million during the year ended December 31,
2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicle deliveries
under leasing programs and programs with resale value guarantees as volume of Model S increased.
For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, costs of services and other revenue were $286.9 million and $166.9 million.
The increase in cost of services and other revenues was driven primarily by greater pre-owned vehicle sales and increased
maintenance and repair services.
Gross profit for the automotive segment increased from $881.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 to $921.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 22.9% and 27.6%.
The lower margin in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to product and regional mix shift, as a greater percentage of sales
were derived from vehicle models with lower average selling prices, and increased manufacturing costs related to the ramp in
production of the small drive unit for dual motor Model S vehicles and start of Model X production, obsolete inventory and lower
ZEV credits revenue. This margin decrease was partially offset by an increasing amount of revenues from vehicles accounted for as
leases including direct lease vehicles and those under our resale value guarantee programs which have a significantly higher gross
margin and from material cost savings. Services and other gross margin were also down year over year, primarily driven by a planned
price reduction for powertrain sales to Daimler.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct material and labor costs, overhead of solar energy systems and
energy storage products and the depreciation expense and maintenance costs associated with leased solar energy systems.
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $166.0 million to $178.3 million during the year ended December 31,
2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is due to an increase of $67.0 million as a result of the inclusion
of SolarCity’s financial results from the acquisition date of November 21, 2016 to December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was
due to increase in the sale of energy storage products and increased expenditures to increase the capacity of energy storage products.
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue in 2014 was insignificant. Gross proﬁt and related margin for energy generation
and storage was also insignificant in all periods presented.
Research and Development Expenses

Asapercentage ofrevenues................................. 11.9% 17.7% 14.5%
Research and development (R&D) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research,
supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional
services and amortized equipment expense.
R&D expenses increased $116.5 million, or 16%, to $834.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $1 16.5 million was primarily due to a $78.2 million increase in employee and labor
related expenses due to a 15% headcount increase as we expanded our vehicle business in the US. and internationally, and a $65.0
million increase in stock-based compensation expense related to an increase in headcount and number of employee stock awards
granted for new hire and refresher employee stock grants. This is partially offset by a $25.9 million decrease in expensed materials
related to our Model X development, which was primarily incurred in 2015. The overall increase also includes $11.0 million related to
SolarCity.
