Note 20 - Deﬁned Contribution Plan
We have a 401(k) savings plan (“the 401(k) plan”) which qualiﬁes as a deferred salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their eligible
compensation, subject to certain limitations. We assumed the SolarCity 401(k) plan, or the Retirement Plan, available to employees
who meet the Retirement Plan’s eligibility requirements. Participants may elect to contribute a percentage of their compensation to the
Retirement Plan, up to a statutory limit. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the
Retirement Plan during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Note 21 — Related Party Transactions
Through the SolarCity acquisition, we have entered into the following related party transactions (in thousands):
December 31, 2016
Solar bonds issued to related parties $ 265,100
Convertible senior notes due to related parties 13,000
Due to related parties (primarily accrued interest on the
Solar Bonds and Convertible Senior notes, included in
accrued and other current liabilities)...................................... $ 5,136
The related party transactions were primarily issuances and maturities of Solar Bonds held by SpaceX, our Chief Executive
Officer, SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer, and SolarCity’s Chief Technology Officer and issuances of convertible senior notes to
an entity affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer and SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer. SpaceX is considered a related party
because our Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chairman, and a significant
stockholder of SpaceX.
As of December 31, 2016, SpaceX held $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in March 2017
and $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in June 2017. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer,
SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer, and SolarCity’s Chief Technology Officer collectively held $100.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of 6.50% Solar Bonds due in February 2018.
From the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016, the interest expense recognized for debt held by related parties was not
material.
