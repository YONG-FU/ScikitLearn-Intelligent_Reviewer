(G) CREDIT RISK
The majority of the Group’s credit risk pertains to the risk of ﬁnancial loss arising from counterparty default on cash investments.
All Group cash is invested according to strict credit criteria and actively monitored by Group Treasury in conjunction with the
current market valuation of derivative contracts. To support this, the Board has implemented an investment policy which
places limits on the maximum cash investment that can be made with any single counterparty depending on their published
external credit rating.
To a lesser extent the Group has an exposure to counterparties on trade receivables. The Group will seek to mitigate credit risk
on sales to third parties through the use of payment at the point of delivery, credit insurance and letters of credit from banks
which meet internal rating criteria.
None of the ﬁnancial instruments of the Group result in material concentrations of credit risks.
EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK
The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
FINANCIAL ASSETS
None of the Group’s cash equivalents, including term deposits with banks, are past due or impaired. Regarding other ﬁnancial
assets that are neither past due nor impaired, there were no indications as at 31 March 2016 (2015, 2014: no indications) that
defaults in payment obligations will occur.

factoring arrangement. These assets do not qualify for derecognition due to the recourse arrangements in place. The related
liability of £116 million (2015: E156 million, 2014: £167 million) is in short—term borrowings. Both the asset and associated
liability are stated at fair value.
