53 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(D) INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates.
The Company is presently funded with long—term ﬁxed interest rate bonds. The Company is subject to variable interest rates
on certain other debt obligations.
As of 31 March 2016 net ﬁnancial assets of £34 million (2015: £34 million, 2014: £25 million) were subject to the variable
interest rate. An increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact
of Enil (2015: Enil, 2014: Enil).
The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also
assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at
that date. The year—end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year.
(E) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
The Company’s policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufﬁcient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations
without the need to carry signiﬁcant net debt over the medium term. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available
to the Company is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
