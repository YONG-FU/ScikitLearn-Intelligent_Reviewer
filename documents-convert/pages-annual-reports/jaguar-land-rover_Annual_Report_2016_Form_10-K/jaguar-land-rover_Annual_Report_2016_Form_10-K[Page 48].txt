34 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
(D) COMMODITY PRICE RISK
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the purchase of certain raw materials such as aluminium, copper,
platinum and palladium. This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative contracts and ﬁxed price contracts with suppliers.
The derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting as the commodity exposure does not meet the hedge accounting
requirements of IAS 39.
The total fair value loss on commodities of £113 million (2015: loss of £38 million, 2014: loss of £18 million) has been
recognised in other income in the consolidated income statement. The losses reported do not reflect the purchasing beneﬁts
received by the Group which are included within material and other cost of sales.
A 10 per cent appreciation/depreciation of all commodity prices underlying such contracts would have resulted in a gain/(loss)
of £52 million (2015: £52 million, 2014: £36 million).
(E) INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in interest income and expense for
the Group.
in addition to issuing long—term ﬁxed—rate bonds, the Group has other facilities in place which are primarily used to ﬁnance
working capital that are subject to variable interest rates. When undertaking a new debt issuance the Board will consider
the ﬁxed/floating interest rate mix of the Group, the outlook for future interest rates and the appetite for certainty of
funding costs.
The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also
assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at
that date. The year—end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year.
As of 31 March 2016 net ﬁnancial liabilities of £116 million (2015: £156 million, 2014: £167 million) were subject to the variable
interest rate. An increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact of
£1 million (2015: £2 million, 2014: £2 million) in the consolidated income statement and £nil (2015, 2014: £nil) in equity.
(F) LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
The Group’s policy on liquidity risk is to maintain sufﬁcient liquidity in the form of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities to
meet the Group’s operating requirements with an appropriate level of headroom.
