53 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
Management uses its bestjudgement in estimating the fair value of its ﬁnancial instruments. However, there are inherent
limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all ﬁnancial instruments, the fair value estimates presented
above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have realised in a sales transaction as of
respective dates. The estimated fair value amounts as of 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 have been
measured as of the respective dates. As such, the fair values of these ﬁnancial instruments subsequent to the respective
reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year—end.
(B) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
As discussed in the Strategic report under the section Our risks, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate,
commodity price, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. The Company has a risk management framework in place which
monitors all of these risks.
(0) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK
The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement and statement of
changes in equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency ofthe Company.
As at 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, there are no designated cash flow hedges.
The Company’s operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The risks primarily relate to
fluctuations in the GBP2US Dollar rate as the Company has US Dollar assets and liabilities and a GBP functional currency.
The following analysis has been calculated based on the gross exposure as of the balance sheet date which could affect the
income statement.
