8 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (‘LTIP’)
The Group operates a LTIP arrangement for certain employees. The scheme provides a cash payment to the employee based
on a speciﬁc number of phantom shares at grant date and the share price of Tata Motors Limited at the vesting date. The cash
payment is dependent upon continued employment for the duration of the three year vesting period. The cash payment has
no exercise price and therefore the weighted average exercise price in all cases is £nil.
