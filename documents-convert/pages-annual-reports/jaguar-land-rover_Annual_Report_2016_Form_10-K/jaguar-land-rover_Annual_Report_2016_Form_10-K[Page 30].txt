At 31 March 2016 the Group had unused tax losses and other temporary differences amounting to £76 million (2015: Enil,
2014: Enil) for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised based upon the forecast proﬁtability of the companies in
which the deferred tax assets arise. As at 31 March 2016 £6 million (2015: £nil, 2014: Enil) of those tax losses expire after
eight years and the remaining balance is not expected to expire.
At 31 March 2016 the Group had temporary differences relating to undistributed proﬁts of equity accounted investees
amounting to £37 million (2015: £nil, 2014: Enil) for which no deferred tax liability has been recognised as it is not expected
to reverse in the foreseeable future.
All deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 are presented as
non—current.
