33 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the going concern operation of its entities and to maintain an
efﬁcient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital, support the corporate strategy and to meet shareholder expectations.
The Group’s policy is to borrow primarily through capital market debt issues to meet anticipated funding requirements and
maintain sufﬁcient liquidity. The Group also maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional
liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to
certain subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash in subsidiaries is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security,
liquidity and yield requirements.
The capital structure is governed according to Group policies approved by the Board and is monitored by various metrics such
as interest cover, as per the debt covenants.
Funding requirements are reviewed periodically with any debt issuances and capital distributions approved by the Board.
The following table summarises the capital of the Group:
