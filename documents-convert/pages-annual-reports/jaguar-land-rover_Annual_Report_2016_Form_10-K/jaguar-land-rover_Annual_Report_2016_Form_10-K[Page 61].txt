In May 2016, the Company proposed an ordinary dividend of £150 million to its immediate parent TML Holdings Pte. Ltd.
(Singapore). This amount was paid in full in June 2016.
During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company identiﬁed that, whilst the Company had proﬁts available to pay the
dividends, prior to the approval of distributions made in respect ofthe ﬁnancialyears ended 31 March 2012 — 31 March 2015,
the Company did not comply with the requirement under section 836 and 838 ofthe Companies Act 2006 to deliver interim
accounts to the registrar of companies. Corrective action was taken in March 2016 to regularise matters by ratifying the
distribution made for each of the respective years and releasing the Company and the directors from any liabilities connected
with those distributions.

52 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the going concern operation of its subsidiary undertakings
and to maintain an efﬁcient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital, support the corporate strategy and to meet
shareholder expectations.
The Company’s policy is to borrow primarily through capital market debt issues to meet anticipated funding requirements and
maintain sufﬁcient liquidity. The Company also maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional
liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to
certain subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash in subsidiaries is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security,
liquidity and yield requirements.
