NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTI N U ED
34 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
i) HEDGE ACCOUNTING EXPOSURES
The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge its risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly
probable forecast transactions. The fair value of such contracts designated in the hedge relationship as of 31 March 2016 was
a net liability of £1,118 million (2015: net liability of £1,263 million, 2014: net asset of £673 million).
Cash flow hedges are expected to be recognised in profit or loss during the years ending 31 March 2017 to 2021. The Group
also has a number of foreign currency options which are entered into as an economic hedge Ofthe financial risks of the Group.
The time value of options is excluded from the hedge relationship and thus the change in time value is recognised immediately
in the consolidated income statement.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency contracts, to the extent determined to be an effective hedge, are recognised
in the statement of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion ofthe fair value change is recognised in the
income statement. Accordingly, the fair value change of net loss of £169 million (2015: loss of £1,768 million, 2014: gain
of £1,041 million) was recognised in other comprehensive income. The loss due to hedge ineffectiveness where forecast
transactions are no longer expected to occur was £2 million (2015: loss of £5 million, 2014: gain of £5 million) which has
been recognised in ‘Foreign exchange (loss)/gain’ in the consolidated income statement. The gain on derivative contracts not
eligible for hedging was £88 million (2015: loss of £161 million, 2014: gain of £57 million) which has been recognised in ‘Foreign
exchange (loss)/gain’ in the consolidated income statement.
A 10 per cent depreciation/appreciation of the foreign currency underlying such contracts would have resulted
in an approximate additional (loss)/gain of (£1,824) million/£1,690 million (2015: £1,251 million/(£1,382) million,
2014: £734 million/(£893) million) in equity and a gain/(loss) of £60 million/£54 million (2015: £165 million/(£91) million,
2014: £51 million/(£31) million) in the consolidated income statement.
In addition to using derivative contracts to economically hedge future purchases in US Dollars, the Group issues bonds
denominated in US Dollars to give a degree of natural hedging of future sales revenues.
