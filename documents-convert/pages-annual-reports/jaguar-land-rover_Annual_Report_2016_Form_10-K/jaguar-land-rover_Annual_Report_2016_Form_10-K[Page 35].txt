PRODUCT WARRANTY PROVISION
The Group offers warranty cover in respect of manufacturing defects, which become apparent up to ﬁve years after purchase,
dependent on the market in which the purchase occurred. The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when
products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost
of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidences based on actions on product failures.
The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk—free discount rate as the risks speciﬁc to the liability, such as
inflation, are included in the base calculation. The timing of outflows will vary as and when a warranty claim will arise, being
typically up to ﬁve years.
LEGAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY PROVISION
A legal and product liability provision is maintained in respect of compliance with regulations and known litigations which
impact the Group. The provision primarily relates to motor accident claims, consumer complaints, dealer terminations,
employment cases, personal injury claims and compliance with regulations.
RESIDUAL RISK PROVISION
In certain markets, the Group is responsible for the residual risk arising on vehicles sold by dealers on leasing arrangements.
The provision is based on the latest available market expectations of future residual value trends. The timing of the outflows
will be at the end of the lease arrangements — being typically up to three years.
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PROVISION
This provision relates to various environmental remediation costs such as asbestos removal and land clean up. The timing of
when these costs will be incurred is not known with certainty.
