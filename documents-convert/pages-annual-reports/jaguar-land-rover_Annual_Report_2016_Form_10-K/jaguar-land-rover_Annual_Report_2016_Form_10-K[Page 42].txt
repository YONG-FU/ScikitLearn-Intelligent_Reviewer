32 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In the normal course of business, the Group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Group assesses such claims
and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel wherever
necessary. The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated
and discloses such matters in its ﬁnancial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not
probable, the Group provides disclosure in the ﬁnancial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss
becomes probable. Such potential losses may be of an uncertain timing and/or amount.
The following is a description of claims and contingencies where a potential loss is possible, but not probable.
Management believes that none ofthe contingencies described below, either individually or in aggregate, would have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
LITIGATION AND PRODUCT RELATED MATTERS
The Group is involved in legal proceedings, both as plaintiff and as defendant. There are claims and potential claims as at
31 March 2016 of £6 million (2015: £11 million, 2014: £27 million) against the Group which management has not recognised as
they are not considered probable. These claims and potential claims pertain to motor accident claims, consumer complaints,
employment and dealership arrangements, replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the
services by the Group or its dealers.
As disclosed in note 41 (Subsequent events), the Group has provided for the estimated costs of repair following the passenger
safety airbag issue in the United States. The Group recognises that there is a potential risk of further recalls in other countries
in the future, however, the Group are unable at this point in time to reliably estimate the amount and timings of any potential
future costs associated with this warranty issue.
OTHER TAXES AND DUES
During the year ended 31 March 2015 the Group’s Brazilian subsidiary has received a demand for 167 million Brazilian Real
(£32 million at 31 March 2016 exchange rates) in relation to additional indirect taxes (PIS and COFINS) claimed as being due on
local vehicle and parts sales made in 2010. The matter is currently being contested before the Brazilian appellate authorities.
Professional legal opinions obtained in Brazil fully support that the basis of the tax authority’s assertion is incorrect and, as a
result, the likelihood of any settlement ultimately having to be made is considered remote. Accordingly no provision has been
recognised in the financial statements and the matter is disclosed here purely for the purposes of completeness.
The Group had no other significant tax matters in dispute as at 31 March 2016, 2015 or 2014 where a potential loss was
considered possible.
COMMITMENTS
The Group has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors for the acquisition of plant and machinery,
equipment and various civil contracts of capital nature aggregating to £797 million (2015: £814 million, 2014: £940 million) and

The Group has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors which include obligations aggregating to
£1,836 million (2015: £642 million, 2014: £717 million) to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of material and other

and commitments.
