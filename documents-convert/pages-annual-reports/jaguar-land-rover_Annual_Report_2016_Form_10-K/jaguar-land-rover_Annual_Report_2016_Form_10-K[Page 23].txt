Included within ‘Over provided in prior years’ for the year ended 31 March 2016 is £45 million relating to enhanced deductions
under the UK Patent Box regime in respect of Fiscal 2014 and 2015.
Included within the line ‘Over provided in prior years’ for March 2015 is a reversal of £62 million relating to withholding tax
released as a result of changes in tax rates and laws expected to apply to the future repatriation of intercompany dividends.
The UK Finance Act 2015 was enacted during the year ended 31 March 2016 which included provisions for a reduction in the
UK corporation tax rate from 20 per cent to 19 per cent with effect from 1 April 2017 and to 18 per cent with effect from
1 April 2020. Accordingly, UK deferred tax has been provided at a blended rate of 18.1 per cent (2015: 20 per cent, 2014: 20 per
cent) in recognising the applicable tax rate at the point when the timing difference is expected to reverse.
A further change to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Chancellor’s Budget during the year ended 31 March
2016. The announcement included a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17 per cent from 1 April 2020. As the
change to 17 per cent had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, its effects are not included in these
financial statements.
