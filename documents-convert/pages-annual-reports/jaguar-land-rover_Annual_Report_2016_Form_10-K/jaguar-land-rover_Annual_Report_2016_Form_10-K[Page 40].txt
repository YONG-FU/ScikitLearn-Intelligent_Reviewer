31 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liability for accounting
purposes were carried out at 31 March 2016 by a qualiﬁed independent actuary. The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt
liability, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal assumptions used in accounting for the pension schemes are set out below:
i 2016 2015 2014'
Year ended 31 March % % % A
Discount rate 3.6 3.4 4.6
Expected rate of increase in compensation level of covered employees 3.5 3.6 3.9
Inflation increase 3.0 3.1 3.4
For the valuation at 31 March 2016, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S2NxA tables and
the Light table for members ofthe Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. A scaling factor of 120 per cent for males and 110 per cent
for females has been used for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 115 per cent for males and 105 per cent for females for the Land Rover
Pension Scheme, and 95 per cent for males and 85 per cent for females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan.
For the valuation at 31 March 2015 and 2014, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular SleA
tables and the Light table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. A scaling factor of 115 per cent has been used
for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 110 per cent for the Land Rover Pension Scheme, and 105 per cent for males and 90 per cent for
females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan.
There is an allowance for future improvements in line with the CMI (2014) projections (2015: CMI (2014) projections, 2014: CM]
(2013) projections) and an allowance for long—term improvements of 1.25 per cent per annum.
The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:

Retiring today:
Males 21.5 21.4 20.0
Females 24.4 23.9 24.5
Retiring in 20 years:
Males 23.2 23.1 23.8
Females 26.2 25.8 26.4
The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
in practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the
sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to signiﬁcant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the deﬁned
beneﬁt obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as
when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of ﬁnancial position.
The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to previous periods.
