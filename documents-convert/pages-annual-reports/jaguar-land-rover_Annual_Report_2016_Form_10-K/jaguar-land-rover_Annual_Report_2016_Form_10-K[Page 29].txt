IMPAIRMENT TESTING
The directors are of the view that the operations of the Group represent a single cash—generating unit. The intellectual
property rights are deemed to have an indeﬁnite useful life on the basis of the expected longevity of the brand names.
For the periods presented, the recoverable amount of the cash—generating unit has been calculated with reference to its value
in use. The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below:
6.5_aft_3_1_"_4?[°£‘ 2915 291.5 29191
Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years 5 years 5 years
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 2.1% 2.2% 0%
Pre-tax discount rate 11.2% 11.2% 10.9%
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation reflect those inherent within the Board’s latest business plan which is
primarily a function of the Group’s cycle plan assumptions, past performance and management’s expectation of future market
developments, through to 2021/22. The cash flows are then extrapolated into perpetuity assuming a growth rate of 2.1 per
cent (2015: 2.2 per cent, 2014: nil per cent).
No reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying
value of the assets of the cash—generating unit.
