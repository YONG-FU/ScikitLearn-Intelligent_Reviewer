FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
Financial instruments held at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels.
- Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by
reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
- Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured
using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);
- Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and
liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are
determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from
observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.
The long—term unsecured listed bonds are held at amortised cost. Their fair value (disclosed above) is determined using Level 1
valuation techniques, based on the closing price at 31 March 2016 on the EURO MTF market. There has been no change in the
valuation techniques adopted or any transfers between fair value levels.
Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short—term deposits, trade receivables and payables, short—term borrowings and
other financial assets and liabilities (current and non—current excluding derivatives) are assumed to approximate to cost due
to the short—term maturing of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.
