2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THE GROUP ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING STANDARDS, REVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO
STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS:
IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts was amended in November 2013 to clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from
employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical
expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, in that contributions, can, but
are not required, to be recognised as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered.
The amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
THE FOLLOWING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ISSUED BY THE IASB AND ENDORSED BY THE EU, ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND
HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GROUP. THE GROUP IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS
ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment has been amended to prohibit entities from using a revenue based depreciation method
for items of property, plant and equipment. IAS 38 introduces a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an appropriate
basis for amortising intangible assets. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016,
with early adoption permitted. These amendments do not have any impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements addresses how ajoint operator should account for the interest in ajoint operation in which
the activity of thejoint operation constitutes a business. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. The amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment has been amended to include ‘bearer plants’ whilst the produce growing on bearer
plants remains within the scope of IAS 41. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016,
with early adoption permitted. The amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements has been amended to support preparers in exercising theirjudgement in presenting
their ﬁnancial reports. This includes clariﬁcation that all information should have materiality considerations applied and
additional examples on expected presentation ofthe ﬁnancial statements. The amendment does not have any impact on the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements based upon the current disclosures given.
IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements has been amended to permit investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
to be optionally accounted for using the equity method in separate ﬁnancial statements. The amendment is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016 with early adoption permitted. This amendment does not have any
impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In addition, as part of the IASB’s Annual Improvements, a number of minor amendments have been made to standards in the
2012—2014 cycles. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016, with early application
permitted. These amendments do not have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
THE FOLLOWING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ISSUED BY THE IASB, HAVE NOT YET BEEN ENDORSED BY THE EU, ARE NOT YET
EFFECTIVE AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GROUP. THE GROUP IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THESE
PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 have been amended to clarify the treatment of the transfer of assets or sale of equity from an investor to
its associate orjoint venture. The mandatory effective date for these amendments has been deferred indeﬁnitely by the IASB.
These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 14 permits an entity which is a ﬁrst—time adopter of International Financial Reporting Standards to continue to account,
with some limited changes, for ‘regulatory deferral account balances’ in accordance with its previous GAAP, both on initial
adoption of IFRS and in subsequent ﬁnancial statements. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after
January 2016 subject to EU endorsement. The amendment does not have any impact the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful
information to users of ﬁnancial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service
and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the beneﬁts from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18
Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group is assessing the impact
of IFRS 15 and expects it to have a signiﬁcant impact on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
