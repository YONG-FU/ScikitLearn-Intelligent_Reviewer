Future Obligations and Commitments
Contractual Obligations
We are subject to certain contractual obligations, including long-term debt and related interest. We
have net unrecognized tax benefits of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2016. However, we cannot make
a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of the underlying liabilities;
therefore, we have not included unrecognized tax benefits in calculating the obligations set forth in the
following table of significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.

Senior Credit Facilities
On July 15, 2016, we amended our senior credit facilities to, among other things, provide for an
incremental senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $130.0 million to
finance the acquisition of Dejana; (ii) permit us to enter into floor plan financing arrangements in an
aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million; (iii) revise the calculation of excess cash ﬂow in
determining the amount of mandatory prepayments under the agreement for the term loan facility (the
“Term Loan Credit Agreement”) to reduce the amount of excess cash ﬂow by the cash portion of the
purchase price of a permitted acquisition paid during any fiscal year, net of any proceeds of any related
financings with respect to such purchase price and any sales of capital assets used to finance such
purchase price; and (iv) extend the final maturity date of the revolving credit facility from
December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2021.
On February 8, 2017, we amended our Term Loan Credit Agreement to, among other things,
(i) convert the existing senior secured term loan facilities into a consolidated senior secured term loan
facility in the aggregate principal amount of $315.5 million; and (ii) decrease the interest rate margins
that apply to the term loan facility from 3.25% to 2.50% for ABR Loans (as defined in the Term Loan
