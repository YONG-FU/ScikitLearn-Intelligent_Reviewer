Gross Proﬁt. Gross profit was $134.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
$132.9 million in 2015, an increase of $1.1 million, or 0.8%, due to the increase in net sales described
above under “—Net Sales” and “—Cost of Sales.” As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased
from 33.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 32.2% for the corresponding period in 2016, as a
result of the factors discussed above under “—Net Sales” and “—Cost of Sales.”
Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including
intangible asset amortization, were $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
$55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $9.4 million, or 16.9%. The
increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to expenses related to
ongoing operations at Work Truck Solutions of $6.5 million. Intangible amortization expense increased
$3.2 million due to additional intangible assets recognized as a result of the Dejana acquisition.
Transaction related costs related to Dejana of $3.4 million also contributed to the increase. Slightly
offsetting these increases were decreases in earnout expense of $1.8 million driven by TrynEx not
meeting performance goals in 2016 and in performance based compensation of $0.9 million. As a
percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization,
increased from 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 15.5% for the corresponding period in
2016 due to the factors noted above, namely the Dejana transaction related costs.
Interest Expense. Interest expense was $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016
compared to $10.9 million in the corresponding period in 2015. Interest expense increased due to the
additional borrowings resulting from the modifications made to the Company’s existing term loan
facility in connection with the financing of the Dejana acquisition.
Litigation Proceeds. Litigation proceeds were $10.1 million year ended December 31, 2016 due to
a settlement related to the successful conclusion of a patent infringement lawsuit against Buyers
Products Company. Under the settlement agreement, the Company received a non-recurring payment
of $10.1 million. There were no litigation proceeds in the year ended December 31, 2015.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reﬂect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state
tax rate for 2016 was 38.8% compared to 33.3% for 2015. The effective tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2016 is higher than 2015 due to the release of valuation allowances in several states
resulting from consecutive years of taxable income in those states in the year ended December 31,
2015.
Net Income. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $39.0 million compared to
net income of $44.2 million for the corresponding period in 2015, a decrease of $5.2 million. This
decrease was driven by the factors described above.
