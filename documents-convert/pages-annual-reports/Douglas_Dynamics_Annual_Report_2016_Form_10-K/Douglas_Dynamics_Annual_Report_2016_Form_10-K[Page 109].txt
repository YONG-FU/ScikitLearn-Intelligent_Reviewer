Performance Share Unit Awards
The Company granted performance share units as performance based awards under the 2010 Plan
in the first quarter of 2016, 2015 and 2014 that are subject to performance conditions. Upon meeting
the prescribed performance conditions, in the first quarter of the year subsequent to grant, employees
will be issued RSUs of which one third will vest immediately upon issuance. The remaining RSUs
issued will be subject to vesting over the two years following the end of the performance period. In
accordance with ASC 718, such awards are being expensed over the vesting period from the date of
grant through the requisite service period, based upon the most probable outcome. As of December 31,
2016, the performance conditions for share units granted in the year ended December 31, 2016 have
been met. Thus, in the first quarter of 2017, management estimates that 87,876 performance share units
will be converted into RSUs. Meanwhile, in the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 there were 71,428 and
71,981 performance share units that converted into RSUs, respectively. Upon conversion, the first third
of the RSUs issued will immediately vest and be converted into common shares. The remaining two
thirds of the RSUs issued will vest ratably over the remaining twoâ€”year vesting period. The fair value
per share of the awards is the closing stock price on the date of grant, which was $19.88, $22.63 and
$16.30 for the 2016, 2015 and 2014 grants, respectively. The Company recognized $1,382, $1,247 and
$730 of compensation expense related to the awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2016
2015, and 2014, respectively. The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value
method for shares that were, as of December 31, 2016, expected to be recognized through the requisite
service period was $326 and is expected to be recognized through 2019.
13. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of
common stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares
and common stock equivalents related to the assumed exercise of stock options, using the two-class
method. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average fair value have an anti-dilutive
effect on earnings per share and are excluded from the calculation. There were no shares excluded
from diluted earnings per share for the years presented.
All restricted stockholders and RSU and performance share unit holders participate in dividends
(through dividend equivalents, in the case of the RSUs and performance share units). Thus, the
Company has calculated earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method, which is an earnings
allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities
according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method,
