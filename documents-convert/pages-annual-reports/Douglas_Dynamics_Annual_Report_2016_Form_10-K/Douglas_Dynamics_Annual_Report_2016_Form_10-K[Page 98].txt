average earnings and credited service. Plans covering hourly employees generally provide benefits of
stated amounts for each year of service. The Company’s funding policy for the plans is to contribute
amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, plus any additional amounts that the Company may determine to be appropriate.
