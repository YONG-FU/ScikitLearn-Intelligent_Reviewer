The goodwill for the acquisition is a result of acquiring and retaining the existing workforces and
expected synergies from integrating the operations into the Company. The Company only expects to be
able to deduct unamortized intangible assets and goodwill that existed at the time of the acquisition of
$4,218 as only the existing goodwill and intangible assets are deductible as a result of not making an
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The remaining useful lives of
intangible assets and goodwill for income tax purposes is 8.4 years. For book purposes, the acquired
intangible assets include customer relationships of $8,300 being amortized over 15 years, patents of
$3,200 being amortized over 10 years, non-compete agreements of $2,090 being amortized over 4 years,
$200 backlog being amortized over six months and trademarks of $3,600 that possess indefinite lives.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of
operations are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition. As the
transaction occurred on December 31, 2014, there was no income statement activity in the year ended
December 31, 2014.
