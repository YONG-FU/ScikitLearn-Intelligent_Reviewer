7. Long-Term Debt (Continued)
After the amendments, the Company’s senior credit facility consists of a $315,540 term loan facility and
the original $100,000 revolving credit facility, of which $10,000 will be available in the form of letters of
credit and $5,000 will be available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate
principal amount of $315,540 and generally bears interest (at the Company’s election) at either
(i) 2.50% per annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit
Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds
transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus
0.50% and (c) 1.00% plus the greater of (1) the LIBOR for a one month interest period multiplied by
the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (2) 1.00% or
(ii) 3.50% per annum plus the greater of (a) the LIBOR for the applicable interest period multiplied
by the Statutory Reserve Rate and (b) 1.00%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also allows the
Company to request the establishment of one or more additional term loan commitments in an
aggregate amount not in excess of $80,000 subject to specified terms and conditions, which amount may
be further increased so long as the First Lien Debt Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit
Agreement) is not greater than 3.25 to 1.00. The actual interest rate on the Term Loan Credit
Agrement for both of the years ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 was 5.25%.
The agreement for the revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) provides that
the Company has the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either (i) a margin
ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the LIBOR
for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Revolving
Credit Agreement) or (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, depending on the
utilization of the facility, plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight federal funds
transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by federal funds brokers plus 0.50%
and (c) the LIBOR for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%.
The maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is June 30, 2021, and the Company’s term loan
amortizes in nominal amounts quarterly with the balance payable on December 31, 2021.
The term loan was originally issued at a $1,900 discount and the incremental term loan was issued
at a $650 discount both of which are being amortized over the term of the term loan. The Company
incurred $2,320 in financing costs in conjunction with the amendment, of which $2,120 relates to the
term loan and $200 related to the revolving line of credit, which are included as deferred financing
costs as a reduction to Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
While the amendment to its term loan facility in the year ending December 31, 2016 was deemed
not to be a significant modification, the Company’s amendment to its term loan facility in the year
ended December 31, 2014 resulted in a significant modification to a portion of the Company’s debt
under ASC 470-50 which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of
$701 and the expensing of certain fees paid of $580, as well as the write off of unamortized debt
discount of $589 which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,870 in the Consolidated
Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2014.
