future cash ﬂows expected to be generated by the assets. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds its
estimated undiscounted future cash ﬂows, an impairment provision is recognized to the extent that the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or the fair value of the asset, less costs of disposition. Management of the
Company considers such factors as current results, trends and future prospects, current market value,
and other economic and regulatory factors in performing these analyses. The Company determined that
no long-lived assets were impaired as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of
December 31, or sooner if impairment indicators arise. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible
assets is estimated based upon an income and market approach. In reviewing goodwill for impairment,
potential impairment is identified by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting units to its
carrying value. The Company has determined it has three reporting units. When the fair value is less
than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, an impairment loss
may be recognized. The Company has determined that goodwill and indefinite lived assets were not
impaired as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company had goodwill of $238,286 and $160,932 at
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of which $160,932 relates to goodwill
associated with the Work Truck Attachments segment at both December 31, 2016 and December 31,
2015 and $77,354 relates to the newly created Work Truck Solutions segment at December 31, 2016.
Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives and are reviewed for potential impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company amortizes its distribution network intangible
over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years, trademarks over 7 to 25 years, patents over 7 to 20 years,
customer relationships over 15 to 19.5 years and noncompete agreements over 4 to 5 years. The
Company acquired backlogs in conjunction with the Dejana and Henderson acquisitions on July 15,
2016 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The Dejana backlog was amortized in the same quarter as
the acquisition. Meanwhile, the Henderson backlog was amortized in the first half of 2015. There were
no indicators of impairment during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Income taxes
Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates. Deferred income tax provisions
or benefits are based on the change in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period.
Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. Additionally, when applicable, the
Company would classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.
