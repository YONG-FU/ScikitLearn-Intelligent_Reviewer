Leases
As of December 31, 2016, twelve of the Company’s up-fit and distribution centers were subject to
a lease agreement.
All of the Company’s current leases are considered operating leases, and are not recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease
term. The Company leases buildings in which it operates from both related party and third party
lessors. See Note 9 for further details.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
computed using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives for financial statement purposes
and an accelerated method for income tax reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives of the assets

Depreciation expense was $6,146, $4,919, and $3,422 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, respectively.
Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or

to operations when incurred. Repairs and maintenance expenses amounted to $5,060, $5,272 and $4,682
for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. When assets are sold or retired,
the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and
any gain or loss is recognized in the results of operations.
