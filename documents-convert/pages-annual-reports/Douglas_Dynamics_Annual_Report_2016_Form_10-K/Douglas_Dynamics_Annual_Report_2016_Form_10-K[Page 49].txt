Credit Agreement) and from 4.25% to 3.50% for Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the Term Loan
Credit Agreement).
Prior to the amendments, our senior credit facilities consisted of a $190.0 million term loan facility
and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility with a group of banks, of which $10.0 million was available
in the form of letters of credit and $5.0 million was available for the issuance of short—term swing line
loans. After the amendments, our senior credit facility consists of a $315.5 million term loan facility
and the original $100.0 million revolving credit facility, of which $10.0 million is available in the form of
letters of credit and $5.0 million is available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.
The Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate
principal amount of $315.5 million and generally bears interest (at our election) at either (i) 2.50% per
annum plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) in
effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with
members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) 1.00%
plus the greater of (1) the LIBOR for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve
Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (2) 1.00% or (ii) 3.50% per annum plus the
greater of (a) the LIBOR for the applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate
and (b) 1.00%. The Term Loan Credit Agreement also allows us to request the establishment of one or
more additional term loan commitments in an aggregate amount not in excess of $80.0 million subject
to specified terms and conditions, which amount may be further increased so long as the First Lien
Debt Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not greater than 3.25 to 1.00.
The agreement for the revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) provides that
we have the option to select whether borrowings will bear interest at either (i) a margin ranging from
1.50% to 2.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of the facility, plus the LIBOR for the
applicable interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Agreement) or (ii) a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum, depending on the utilization of
the facility, plus the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) in
effect on such day, (b) the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds transactions with
members of the Federal Reserve System arranged by Federal funds brokers plus 0.50% and (c) the
LIBOR for a one month interest period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The
maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is June 30, 2021, and our term loan amortizes in
nominal amounts quarterly with the balance payable on December 31, 2021.
The term loan was originally issued at a $1.9 million discount and the incremental term loan was
issued at a $0.7 million discount both of which are being amortized over the term of the term loan. We
incurred $2.3 million in financing costs in conjunction with the amendment, of which $2.1 million
relates to the term loan and $0.2 million related to the revolving line of credit, which are included as
deferred financing costs as a reduction to Long—Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
While the amendment to our term loan facility in the year ending December 31, 2016 was deemed
not to be a significant modification, the amendment to our term loan facility in the year ended
December 31, 2014 resulted in a significant modification to a portion of our debt under ASC 470-50—
Debt which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of $0.7 million
and the expensing of certain fees paid of $0.6 million as well as the write off of unamortized debt
discount of $0.6 million which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million in the
Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2014.
At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding borrowings under the term loan of $313.6 million and
no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and remaining borrowing availability of
$89.7 million.
