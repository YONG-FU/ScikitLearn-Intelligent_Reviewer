9. Warranty Liability
The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs as sales are recognized and periodically
assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amount as necessary. The
Company’s warranties generally provide, with respect to its snow and ice control equipment, that all
material and workmanship will be free from defect for a period of one to two years after the date of
purchase by the end-user, and with respect to its parts and accessories purchased separately, that such
parts and accessories will be free from defect for a period of one year after the date of purchase by the
end-user. Certain snowplows only provide for a one year warranty. The Company determines the
amount of the estimated warranty costs (and its corresponding warranty reserve) based on the
Company’s prior five years of warranty history utilizing a formula driven by historical warranty expense
and applying management’s judgment. The Company adjusts its historical warranty costs to take into
account unique factors such as the introduction of new products into the marketplace that do not
provide a historical warranty record to assess. The warranty reserve is $6,160 at December 31, 2016 of
which $2,625 is included in Other long term liabilities and $3,535 is included in Accrued expenses and
other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2015 $7,423
is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
