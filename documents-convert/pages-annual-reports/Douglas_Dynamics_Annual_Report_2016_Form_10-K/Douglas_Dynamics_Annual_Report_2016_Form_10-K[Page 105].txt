Defined contribution plan
The Company has a defined contribution plan, which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code and provides substantially all employees an opportunity to accumulate personal funds

employees’ direction, among a variety of investment alternatives including, commencing January 1,
2013, a Company common stock fund designated as an employee stock ownership plan.
As determined by the provisions of the plan, the Company matches a portion of the employees’
basic voluntary contributions. The Company matching contributions to the plan were approximately
$863, $377 and $255 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Beginning
