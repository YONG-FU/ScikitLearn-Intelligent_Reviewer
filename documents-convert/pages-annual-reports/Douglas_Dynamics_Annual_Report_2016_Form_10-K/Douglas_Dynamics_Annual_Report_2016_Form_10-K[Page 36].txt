Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015
Net Sales. Net sales were $416.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to
$400.4 million in 2015, an increase of $15.9 million, or 4.0%. Net sales increased for the year ended
December 31, 2016 due to the addition of $65.0 million in sales attributable to the Work Truck
Solutions segment that resulted from the Dejana acquisition. Work Truck Attachments segment net
sales decreased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to below average
levels of snowfall in the snow season ending March 31, 2016. These impacts were offset by ongoing
growth in demand for Henderson products and services. Finally, of the $9.9 million in shipments from
the Work Truck Attachments segment to the Work Truck Solutions segment following the Dejana
acquisition, which was in line with historical trends, only $4.9 million was recognized as revenue when
sold to end users by Work Truck Solutions. The remaining $5.0 million was still in Work Truck
Solutions inventory at year ended December 31, 2016 and is expected to be shipped and recorded as
revenue in the first quarter of 2017. All future shipments from the Work Truck Attachments segment to
Work Truck Solutions will similarly not be recognized as revenue until they are sold to customers of
Work Truck Solutions.
Cost of Sales. Cost of sales was $282.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared
to $267.5 million in 2015, an increase of $14.8 million, or 5.5%. . Cost of sales as a percentage of net
sales increased from 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 67.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The increase in cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared
to the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven by the addition of $51.0 million in cost of sales
attributable to the Work Truck Solutions segment that resulted from the Dejana acquisition as
discussed above under “—Net Sales.” The increases in cost of sales as a percentage of sales were
primarily due to higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales for Work Truck Solutions products. For
the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the prior year, cost of sales as percentage of net
sales increased as a result of increasing marginal production costs due to decreased volume for the
Work Truck Attachment segment. As a percentage of cost of sales, fixed and variable costs were
approximately 17% and 83%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to
approximately 16% and 84%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
