non-Henderson products was due to a record number of new product releases which commenced
shipping in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally contributing to the increase was the impact of three
consecutive years of above average snowfall.
Cost of Sales. Cost of sales was $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared
to $187.2 million in 2014, an increase of $80.3 million, or 42.8%. This increase was driven primarily by
increased volume of products sold. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased from 61.7% for
the year ended December 31, 2014 to 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in
cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014
was driven by $77.2 million in cost attributable to the $96.1 million in sales at Henderson and costs
associated with the non-Henderson new products as discussed above under “—Net Sales”. The
increases in cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to higher cost of sales as a
percentage of sales for Henderson products. In addition, the cost of sales as a percentage of sales for
the year ended December 31, 2015 includes the recognized expense of a $2.0 million fair value
purchase accounting write up of inventory that was sold during the period. As a percentage of cost of
sales, fixed and variable costs were approximately 16% and 84%, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2015, compared to approximately 14% and 86%, respectively, for the year ended
December 31, 2014.
Gross Proﬁt. Gross profit was $132.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to
$116.3 million in 2014, an increase of $16.6 million, or 14.3%, due to the increase in net sales volume
described above under “—Net Sales” and “—Cost of Sales.” As a percentage of net sales, gross profit
decreased from 38.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 33.2% for the corresponding period in
2015, as a result of the factors discussed above under “—Net Sales” and “—Cost of Sales.”
Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including
intangible asset amortization, were $55.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to
$44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $11.5 million, or 25.9%. The
increase compared to year ended December 31, 2014 was mostly due to expenses related to ongoing
operations at Henderson of $10.5 million. Intangible amortization expense increased $1.6 million due to
additional intangible assets created as a result of the Henderson acquisition. As a percentage of net
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, including intangibles amortization, decreased from
14.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.9% for the corresponding period in 2015 due to
sales leverage.
Interest Expense. Interest expense was $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015
compared to $8.1 million in the corresponding period in 2014. Interest expense increased due to the
additional borrowings resulting from the modifications made to the Company’s existing term loan
facility in connection with the financing of the Henderson acquisition.
Loss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $1.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2014. In 2015, we did not refinance any of our debt and therefore did not incur a
loss on extinguishment. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 was entirely driven by our
amendment to our term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of our debt for a portion of
our creditors which resulted in the write off of unamortized capitalized deferred financing costs of
$0.7 million, write off of unamortized debt discount of $0.6 million and the expensing of certain fees of
$0.6 million.
Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reﬂect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. The largest item affecting deferred taxes is the difference between book and tax
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization. Our effective combined federal and state
tax rate for 2015 was 33.3% compared to 35.6% for 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended
