Sources and Uses of Cash
During the three-year periods described above, net cash provided by operating activities was used
for funding capital investment, paying dividends, paying interest on our senior credit facilities, and
funding working capital requirements during our pre-season shipping period. Additionally, cash from
operations was used to fully fund the acquisition of the TrynEX business and to fund a portion of the
acquisitions of Henderson and Dejana.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $13.5 million from the year ended
December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating
activities was due to $18.4 million in favorable working capital changes slightly offset by a $4.9 million
decrease in net income adjusted for reconciling items. The largest driver positively impacting cash ﬂows
was a net increase in cash provided by accounts receivable of $9.5 million driven by a $2.4 million
increase in accounts receivable from the year ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 as
compared to a $7.1 million decrease in accounts receivable from the year ended December 31, 2014 to
December 31, 2015.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $169.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This increase was due to the $181.3 million in
cash outﬂow in 2016 for the Dejana acquisition as compared to $11.8 million in outﬂows in 2015 to
complete the Henderson acquisition. Slightly offsetting this increase in cash used in investing activities
was a decrease in capital expenditures in 2016 as compared to 2015 by $0.2 million.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $125.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The increase in cash provided by
financing activities was largely due to a $128.7 million net increase in 2016 resulting from borrowing
and payments of long term debt. The net increase in 2016 was a result of the Company amending and
restating its senior credit facility to fund the Dejana acquisition, which included borrowings of long
term debt of $129.4 million, partially offset by current year principal payments on our debt of
$2.6 million. In 2015, we had no similar increase and made $1.9 million in repayments of long term
debt. In conjunction with amending the Company’s senior credit facility, $2.3 million in financing costs
