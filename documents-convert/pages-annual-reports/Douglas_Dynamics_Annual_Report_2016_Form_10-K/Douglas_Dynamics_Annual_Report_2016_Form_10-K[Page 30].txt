In accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, dividends are declared and paid quarterly at
the discretion of the board of directors. Additionally, special dividends may be declared and paid at the

The Company’s senior credit facilities include certain negative and operating covenants, including
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, and other customary covenants, representations and
warranties and events of default. The senior credit facilities entered into and recorded by the
Company’s subsidiaries significantly restrict its subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise
transferring assets to the Company. The terms of the Company’s revolving credit facility specifically
restrict the Company from paying dividends if a minimum availability under the revolving credit facility,
the greater of $15.0 million and 15% of the aggregate revolving commitments at the time of
determination, is not maintained. Additionally, both senior credit facilities restrict the Company from
paying dividends above certain levels not to exceed $6.25 million in any fiscal quarter of 2015,
$6.5 million in any fiscal quarter of 2016 and $6.5 million in any fiscal quarter of 2017 and thereafter
or at all if an event of default has occurred. These restrictions would affect the Company indirectly
since the Company relies principally on distributions from its subsidiaries to have funds available for
the payment of dividends.
