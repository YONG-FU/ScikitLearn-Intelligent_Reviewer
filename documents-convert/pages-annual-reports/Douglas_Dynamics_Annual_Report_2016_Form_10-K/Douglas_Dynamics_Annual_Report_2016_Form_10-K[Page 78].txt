For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded the write-off of certain deferred
financing costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt, in the consolidated statements of income as a result
of an amendment to the Company’s term loan facility resulting in a significant modification of the debt
for certain lenders under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 470-50—Debt Modiﬁcations and
Extinguishments.
Fair Value
Fair value is the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between
knowledgeable, willing parties. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to
transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the
creditor. Fair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of
significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market
inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3
(unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).
