20. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”, which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to
depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires
additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets
recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period and is
to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods, with early application permitted for
fiscal reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has developed a project plan
with respect to its implementation of this standard, including identification of revenue streams and
review of contracts and procedures currently in place, and is evaluating the impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The adoption of this guidance will result in
increased disclosures to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount, and timing
of revenue and cash ﬂows arising from contracts. The Company is in the process of identifying and
implementing changes to processes and controls to meet the standard’s updated reporting and
disclosure requirements and continues to update its assessment of the impact of the standard. The
Company further expects to further its assessment on the financial impact of the new guidance on its
Consolidated Financial Statements by mid—2017.
In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17,
Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes, which will require entities to present deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current
