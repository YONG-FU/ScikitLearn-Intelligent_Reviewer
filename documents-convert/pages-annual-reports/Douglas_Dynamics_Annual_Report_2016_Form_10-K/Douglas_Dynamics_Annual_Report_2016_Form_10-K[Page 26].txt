comply with these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facilities, which could
prevent us from paying dividends, borrowing additional amounts and using proceeds of our inventory
and accounts receivable, and also permit the lenders to accelerate the payment of such debt. If any of
our debt is accelerated or if a liquidity event (or event of default) occurs that results in collateral
proceeds being applied to reduce such debt, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such
debt and our other obligations, in which case, our business could be halted and such lenders could
proceed against any collateral securing that debt. Further, if the lenders accelerate the payment of the
indebtedness under our senior credit facilities, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the
indebtedness under our senior credit facilities and our other indebtedness, if any. We cannot assure you
that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital
needs to pursue available business opportunities or react to changes in our business and the industry in
which we operate.
Provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the
acquisition would be beneﬁcial to you.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include:

of a majority of our common stock may elect all of the directors standing for election;
° the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting rights or with rights
senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our
common stock;

terms;
° the ability of our stockholders to remove our directors is limited to cause and only by the vote
of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;
° the prohibition on our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings;
° the requirement that our stockholders provide advance notice when nominating our directors or
proposing business to be considered by the stockholders at an annual meeting of stockholders;
and
° the requirement that our stockholders must obtain a 662/3% vote to amend or repeal certain
provisions of our certificate of incorporation.
We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to
certain exceptions, prohibits us from engaging in any business combination with any interested
stockholder, as defined in that section, for a period of three years following the date on which that
stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision, together with the provisions discussed
above, could also make it more difficult for you and our other stockholders to elect directors and take
other corporate actions, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future
for shares of our common stock.
Our dividend policy may limit our ability to pursue growth opportunities.
If we continue to pay dividends at the level contemplated by our dividend policy, as in effect on
the date of this filing, or if we increase the level of our dividend payments in the future, we may not
