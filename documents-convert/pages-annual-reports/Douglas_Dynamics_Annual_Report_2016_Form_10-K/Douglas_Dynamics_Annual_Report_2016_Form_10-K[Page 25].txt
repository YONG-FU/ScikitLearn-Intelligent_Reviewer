interest rate on any revolving borrowings is subject to an increase in the interest rate if the average
daily availability under our revolving credit facility falls below a certain threshold. If interest rates
increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the
amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows would correspondingly
decrease.
Our senior credit facilities impose restrictions on us, which may also prevent us from capitalizing on business
opportunities and taking certain corporate actions. One of these facilities also includes minimum availability
requirements, which if unsatisﬁed, could result in liquidity events that may jeopardize our business.
Our senior credit facilities contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject
may contain, covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our
company. Under the credit facilities, these covenants include restrictions on our ability to:
0 incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness or contingent obligations;
° incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;
0 make loans and investments in excess of agreed upon amounts;
0 declare dividends, make payments or redeem or repurchase capital stock in excess of agreed
upon amounts and subject to certain other limitations;
0 engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;
0 prepay, redeem or purchase certain indebtedness or amend or alter the terms of our
indebtedness;
° sell assets;
0 make further negative pledges;
° create restrictions on distributions by subsidiaries;
° change our fiscal year;
0 engage in activities other than, among other things, incurring the debt under our new senior
credit facilities and the activities related thereto, holding our ownership interest in DDI LLC,
making restricted payments, including dividends, permitted by our senior credit facilities and
conducting activities related to our status as a public company;
0 amend or waive rights under certain agreements;
° transact with affiliates or our stockholders; and
0 alter the business that we conduct.
Our amended revolving credit facility also includes limitations on capital expenditures and requires
that if we fail to maintain the greater of $12,500,000 and 12.5% of the revolving commitments in
borrowing availability, we must comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio test. In addition, if a liquidity
event occurs because our borrowing availability is less than the greater of $15,000,000 and 15% of the
aggregate revolving commitments (or an event of default occurs and is continuing), subject to certain
limited cure rights, all proceeds of our accounts receivable and other collateral will be applied to
reduce obligations under our amended revolving credit facility, jeopardizing our ability to meet other
obligations. Our ability to comply with the covenants contained in our senior credit facilities or in the
agreements governing our future indebtedness, and our ability to avoid liquidity events, may be affected
by events, or our future performance, which are subject to factors beyond our control, including
prevailing economic, financial, industry and weather conditions, such as the level, timing and location of
snowfall and general economic conditions in the snowbelt regions of North America. A failure to
