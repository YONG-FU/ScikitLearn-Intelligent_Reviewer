3. Acquisitions (Continued)
The Dejana purchase agreement includes contingent consideration in the form of an earn out
capped at $26,000. Under the earn out agreement, the former owners of Dejana are entitled to receive
payments contingent upon the revenue growth and financial performance of the acquired business for
the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The preliminary estimated fair value of the earn out consideration was
$10,200 which was further adjusted at December 31, 2016 to $10,373 as a result of the 2016
performance exceeding the 2016 fair value established at the opening balance sheet by $173. The
subsequent adjustment is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income in the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the year ending
December 31, 2016 results, the new possible range of outcomes was reduced from $26,000 to a
maximum earnout of $21,487.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price paid and the

The goodwill for the acquisition is a result of acquiring and retaining the existing workforces and
expected synergies from integrating the operations into the Company. Due to the limited amount of
time since the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dejana, the initial purchase price
allocation is preliminary as of December 31, 2016 as the Company has not completed its analysis of
income tax liabilities. The Company expects to be able to deduct amortization of goodwill for income
tax purposes over a fifteen-year period.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method, and accordingly, the results of
operations are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition. From the
date of acquisition through December 31, 2016, the Dejana assets contributed $65,044 of revenues and
($1,397) of pre-tax operating losses.
The following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined results of operations of the
Company and Dejana for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 as if the
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015, with pro forma adjustments to give effect to amortization
