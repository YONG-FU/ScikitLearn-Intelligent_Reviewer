(a) Included in other assets is the cash surrender value of insurance policies on various individuals
that are associated with the Company. The carrying amounts of these insurance policies
approximates their fair value.
(b) Valuation models are calibrated to initial trade price. Subsequent valuations are based on
observable inputs to the valuation model (e.g. interest rates and credit spreads). Model inputs are
changed only when corroborated by market data. A credit risk adjustment is made on each swap
using observable market credit spreads. Thus, inputs used to determine fair value of the interest
rate swap are Level 2 inputs. Interest rate swaps of $335 and $1,650 at December 31, 2016 are
included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities,
respectively. Interest rate swaps of $286 and $1,215 at December 31, 2015 are included in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively.
(c) The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including current maturities, is estimated using
discounted cash ﬂows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements, which is a Level 2 input for all periods presented. Meanwhile,
long-term debt is recorded at carrying amount, net of discount, as disclosed on the face of the
balance sheet.
(d) Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities in the
amounts of $194 and $442, respectively, at December 31, 2016 is the fair value of an obligation for
a portion of the potential earn out acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Henderson.
Included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long term liabilities in the
amounts of $319 and $442, respectively, at December 31, 2015 is the fair value of an obligation for
a portion of the potential earn out acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of Henderson. Fair
value is based upon Level 3 discounted cash ﬂow analysis using key inputs of forecasted future
