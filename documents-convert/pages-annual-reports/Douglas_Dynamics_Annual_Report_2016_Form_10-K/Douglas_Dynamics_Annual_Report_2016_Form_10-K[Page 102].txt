Postretirement benefits
The Company provides postretirement healthcare benefits for certain employee groups. The
postretirement healthcare plans are contributory and contain certain other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles and coinsurance. The plans are unfunded. Employees do not vest until they retire from
active employment with the Company and have at least twelve years of service. These benefits can be
amended or terminated at anytime and are subject to the same ongoing changes as the Companyâ€™s
healthcare benefits for employees with respect to deductible, co-insurance and participant contributions.
Effective January 1, 2004, the postretirement healthcare benefits were extended to all active
employees of the Company as of December 31, 2003. The period of coverage was reduced and the
retiree contribution percentage was increased in order to keep the cost of the plan equivalent to the
previous plan design.
Maximum coverage under the plan is limited to ten years. All benefits terminate upon the death of
the retiree. Employees who began working for the Company after December 31, 2003, are not eligible
for postretirement healthcare benefits.
