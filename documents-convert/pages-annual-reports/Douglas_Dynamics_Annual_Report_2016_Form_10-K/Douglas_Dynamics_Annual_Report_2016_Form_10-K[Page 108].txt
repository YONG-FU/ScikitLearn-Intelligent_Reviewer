(Dollars in Thousands Except Per Share Data)
12. Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)
unvested RSUs upon retirement. As the retirement provision does not qualify as a substantive service
condition, the Company incurred $528 and $303 in additional expense in the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively, as a result of accelerated stock based compensation expense for employees
who meet the thresholds of the retirement provision. The Company’s nominating and governance
committee also approved a retirement provision for the RSUs issued to non-employee directors that
accelerates the vesting of such RSUs upon retirement. Such awards are fully expensed immediately
upon grant in accordance with ASC 718, as the retirement provision eliminates substantive service
conditions associated with the awards.

The Company recognized $1,516, $1,643 and $1,247 of compensation expense related to the RSU
awards in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The unrecognized
compensation expense, net of expected forfeitures, calculated under the fair value method for shares
that were, as of December 31, 2016, expected to be earned through the requisite service period was
approximately $454 and is expected to be recognized through 2019.
Vested RSUs are “settled” by the delivery to the participant or a designated brokerage firm of one
share of common stock per vested RSU as soon as reasonably practicable following a termination of
service of the participant that constitutes a separation from service, and in all events no later than the
end of the calendar year in which such termination of service occurs or, if later, two and one-half
months after such termination of service.
