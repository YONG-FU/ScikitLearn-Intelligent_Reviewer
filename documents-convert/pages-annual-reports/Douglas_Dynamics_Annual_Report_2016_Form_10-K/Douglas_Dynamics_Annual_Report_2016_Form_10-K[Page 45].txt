Net cash provided by operating activities increased $2.7 million from the year ended December 31,
2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was
due to a $13.3 million increase in net income adjusted for reconciling items slightly offset by a
$10.5 million in unfavorable working capital changes. Negatively impacting cash flow was a $6.8 million
increase in accounts receivable and a $4.9 million increase in refundable income taxes paid.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $69.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015,
compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This decrease was due to the $86.7 million in cash
outﬂow in 2014 for the Henderson acquisition as compared to $11.8 million in additional outﬂows 2015
to complete the Henderson acquisition. Slightly offsetting this decrease, cash used in investing increased
as a result of an increase in capital expenditures in 2015 as compared to 2014 by $4.8 million due to
facility remodels and large expenditures related to equipment.
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $63.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014. The decrease in cash provided by
financing activities was largely due to a $77.5 million net increase in 2014 resulting from borrowing and
payments of long term debt. The net increase in 2014 was a result of the Company amending and
restating its senior credit facility to fund the Henderson acquisition, which included borrowings of long
term debt of $188.1 million, partially offset by repayment of existing debt of $111.8 million. In 2015, we
had no similar increase and made $1.9 million in repayments of long term debt. In conjunction with
amending the Company’s senior credit facility, $2.1 million in financing costs were paid in 2014. We
also paid dividends of $19.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to dividends paid
of $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. We had no outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility at either December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2015.
