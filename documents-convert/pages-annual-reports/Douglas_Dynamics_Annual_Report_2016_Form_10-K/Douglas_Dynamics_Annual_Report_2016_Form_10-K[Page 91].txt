On July 15, 2016, the Company amended its senior credit facilities to, among other things,
(i) provide for an incremental senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of
$130,000 to finance the acquisition of Dejana; (ii) permit the Company to enter into ﬂoor plan
financing arrangements in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20,000; (iii) revise the calculation of
excess cash ﬂow in determining the amount of mandatory prepayments under the agreement for the
term loan facility (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) to reduce the amount of excess cash ﬂow by
the cash portion of the purchase price of a permitted acquisition paid during any fiscal year, net of any
proceeds of any related financings with respect to such purchase price and any sales of capital assets
used to finance such purchase price; and (iv) extend the final maturity date of the revolving credit
facility from December 31, 2019 to June 30, 2021.
On February 8, 2017, the Company amended its Term Loan Credit Agreement to, among other
things, (i) convert the existing senior secured term loan facilities into a consolidated senior secured
term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $315.5 million; and (ii) decrease the interest rate
margins that apply to the term loan facility from 3.25% to 2.50% for ABR Loans (as defined in the
Term Loan Credit Agreement) and from 4.25% to 3.50% for Eurodollar Rate Loans (as defined in the
Term Loan Credit Agreement).
Prior to the amendments, the Company’s senior credit facilities consisted of a $190,000 term loan
facility and a $100,000 revolving credit facility with a group of banks, of which $10,000 was available in
the form of letters of credit and $5,000 was available for the issuance of short-term swingline loans.
