Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are granted to both non-employee directors and management.
Prior to 2013, RSUs were only issued to directors. However, in 2013, the Company changed the timing
and form of management’s annual stock grants and began to grant RSUs to management. For both
non-employee directors and management, RSUs carry dividend equivalent rights but do not carry
voting rights. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock and
is subject to time based vesting restrictions. Participants are not required to pay any consideration to
the Company at either the time of grant of a RSU or upon vesting.
In 2013, the Company’s compensation committee approved a retirement provision for RSUs issued
to management. The retirement provision provides that members of management who either (1) are
age 65 or older or (2) have at least ten years of service and are at least age 55 will continue to vest in
