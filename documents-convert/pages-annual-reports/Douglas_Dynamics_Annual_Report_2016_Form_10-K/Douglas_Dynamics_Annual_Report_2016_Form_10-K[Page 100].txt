11. Employee Retirement Plans (Continued)
The discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 was 4.2% for
both the hourly and salaried pension plans. Meanwhile the discount rate used to determine the benefit
obligation at December 31, 2015 was 4.5% for the both the hourly and salaried pension plans.
For 2017, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is 6.50%. To determine the
long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, the Company studies historical markets and
preserves the long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed-income securities consistent
with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater
return over the long run. The Company evaluates current market factors such as inﬂation and interest
rates before it determines long-term capital market assumptions and reviews peer data and historical
returns to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.
The expected benefit payments under the pension plans are as follows:
$1,400
1,430
1,410
1,480
1,530
2022-2026 9,560
The Company made required minimum pension funding contributions of $411 and voluntary
contributions of $1,300 to the pension plans in 2016 and currently expects to make $216 of required
minimum pension funding contributions in 2017.
The Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on an
investment policy established for the pension plans, which is designed to achieve long-term objectives of
return, while mitigating downside risk and considering expected cash flows. The current weighted-
average target asset allocations are reﬂective of actual investments at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
The investment policy is reviewed periodically in order to achieve overall objectives in light of current
circumstances.
The Company’s weighted-average asset allocation and actual allocation for the qualified pension
plans by asset category at December 31 is as follows:
