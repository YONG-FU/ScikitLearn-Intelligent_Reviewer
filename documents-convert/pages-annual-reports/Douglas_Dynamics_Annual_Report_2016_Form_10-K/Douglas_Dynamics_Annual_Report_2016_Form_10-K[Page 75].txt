Interest Rate Swap
As required by the Company’s prior debt agreement the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement in the second quarter of 2011 to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from
increases in market interest rates. Under the interest rate swap agreement, effective as of July 18, 2011,
the Company either received or made payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between
6.335% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR ﬂoor of 1.5%). The interest rate swap agreement
expired in December of 2014. On December 31, 2014, the Company amended its senior credit facility,
which no longer required the Company to have a hedge agreement in place.
The Company is a counterparty to interest-rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential
impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates. The Company entered into three interest
rate swap agreements during the first quarter of 2015 with notional amounts of $45,000, $90,000 and
$135,000 effective for the periods December 31, 2015 through March 29, 2018, March 29, 2018 through
March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2020 through June 30, 2021, respectively. Under the interest rate swap
agreement, effective as of December 31, 2015 the Company will either receive or make payments on a
monthly basis based on the differential between 6.105% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR ﬂoor
of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement, effective as of March 29, 2018 the Company will
either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the differential between 6.916% and
LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR ﬂoor of 1.0%). Under the interest rate swap agreement effective as
of March 31, 2020 the Company will either receive or make payments on a monthly basis based on the
differential between 7.168% and LIBOR plus 4.25% (with a LIBOR ﬂoor of 1.0%). The negative fair
value of the interest rate swap, net of tax, of ($1,195) and ($937) at December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance
sheet. This fair value was determined using Level 2 inputs as defined in Accounting Standards
Codification Topic (“ASC”) 820—Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market is determined based on estimated
realizable values. Inventory costs are primarily determined by the first-in, first—out (FIFO) method. The
Company periodically reviews its inventory for slow moving, damaged and discontinued items and
provides reserves to reduce such items identified to their recoverable amounts.
The Company records inventories to include truck chassis inventory financed through a ﬂoor plan
financing agreement as discussed in Note 7. The Company takes title to truck chassis upon receipt of
the inventory through their ﬂoor plan agreement and performs up-fitting service installations to the
truck chassis inventory during the installation period. The ﬂoor plan obligation is then assumed by the
dealer customer upon delivery. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $3,939 of chassis inventory
and related ﬂoor plan financing obligation. The Company recognizes revenue associated with up-fitting
and service installations net of the truck chassis. As the Company acquired Dejana in the year ended
December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any chassis inventory at December 31, 2015.
The Company receives, on consignment, truck chassis on which it performs up-fitting service
installations under “bailment pool” arrangements with major truck manufacturers. The Company never
