The investment strategy is to build an efficient, well-diversified portfolio based on a long-term,
strategic outlook of the investment markets. The investment market outlook utilizes both historical-
based and forward-looking return forecasts to establish future return expectations for various asset
classes. These return expectations are used to develop a core asset allocation based on the needs of the
plan. The core asset allocation utilizes investment portfolios of various asset classes and multiple
investment managers in order to help maximize the plan’s return while providing multiple layers of
diversification to help minimize risk.
