Taxable REIT Subsidiaries and Taxable Entities
The Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on income reported through its TRS activities, which include
wholly—owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Company’s TRSs included KRS, FNC Realty Corporation, Kimco Insurance
Company (collectively “KRS Consolidated”) and the consolidated entity, Blue Ridge Real Estate Company/Big Boulder
Corporation. As part of the Company’s overall strategy to simplify its business model, the Company merged KRS, a TRS holding
REIT—qualifying real estate and the Company’s investment in Albertsons, into a wholly-owned LLC and KRS was dissolved
effective August 1, 2016. Any non-REIT qualifying assets or activities received by the Company in the Merger were transferred
to a newly formed TRS, Kimco Realty Services II, Inc.
The Company is also subject to local non-US. taxes on certain investments located outside the US. In general, under local
country law applicable to the entity ownership structures the Company has in place and applicable tax treaties, the repatriation of
cash to the Company from its subsidiaries and joint ventures in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico generally is not subject to
withholding tax. The Company is subject to and includes in its tax provision non-US. income taxes on certain investments
located in jurisdictions outside the US. These investments are held by the Company at the REIT level and not in the Company’s
taxable REIT subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company does not expect a US. income tax impact associated with the repatriation of
undistributed earnings from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.
Income taxes have been provided for on the asset and liability method as required by the FASB’s Income Tax guidance. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of taxable assets and liabilities.

entities which have been consolidated for accounting reporting purposes, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
