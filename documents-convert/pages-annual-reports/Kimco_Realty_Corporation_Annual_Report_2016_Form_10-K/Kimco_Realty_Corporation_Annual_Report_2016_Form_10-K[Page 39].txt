Critical Accounting Policies
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and
all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, including where the Company has been determined to be a primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”). The Company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost, equity or
consolidation method of accounting is appropriate. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect
amounts reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements,
management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. These estimates are
based on, but not limited to, historical results, industry standards and current economic conditions, giving due consideration to
materiality. The most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts
receivable, depreciable lives, valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities, valuation of joint venture investments and
other investments, realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. Application of these assumptions requires the
exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate
properties, investments in joint ventures, marketable securities and other investments. The Company’s reported net earnings are
directly affected by management’s estimate of impairments and/or valuation allowances.
Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable
Base rental revenues from rental properties are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Certain of
these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee. These percentage rents are
recorded once the required sales level is achieved. Operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned. Rental income may
also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements. In addition, leases typically provide for
reimbursement to the Company of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses.
The Company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents, straight-line rent, expense
reimbursements and other revenues. The Company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, customer credit-
worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in
bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims.
The Company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by management’s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable.
Real Estate
The Company’s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Significant renovations and replacements, which
improve and extend the life of the asset, are capitalized.
Upon acquisition of real estate operating properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting
of land, building, building improvements and tenant improvements) and identified intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above
and below-market leases, in—place leases and tenant relationships, where applicable), assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the
date of acquisition, based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Fair value is determined based on an exit
