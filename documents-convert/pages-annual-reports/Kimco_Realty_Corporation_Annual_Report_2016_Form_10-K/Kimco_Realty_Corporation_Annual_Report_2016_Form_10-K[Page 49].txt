Term Loan
The Company had a $650.0 million unsecured term loan (“Term Loan’) which was scheduled to mature in January 2017, with
three one-year extension options at the Company’s discretion, and accrued interest at a spread (95 basis points at December 31, 2016)
to LIBOR or at the Company’s option at a base rate as defined per the agreement (1.60% at December 31, 2016). During November
2016, the Company repaid $400.0 million of borrowings under the Company’s Term Loan. As of December 31, 2016, the Term Loan
had a balance of $250.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement for the Term Loan, the Company, among other things,
is subject to covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) maximum indebtedness ratios and (ii) minimum interest and fixed charge
coverage ratios. The Term Loan covenants are similar to the Credit Facility covenants described above. During January 2017, the
Company repaid the remaining $250.0 million balance on the Term Loan and terminated the agreement.
Mortgages Payable
During 2016, the Company (i) assumed $289.0 million of individual non-recourse mortgage debt relating to the acquisition of 10
properties, including $4.3 million associated with fair value debt adjustments and (ii) paid off $703.0 million of mortgage debt
(including fair market value adjustment of $2.1 million) that encumbered 47 operating properties. In connection with the early
prepayment of certain of these mortgages, the Company recorded an early extinguishment of debt charge of $9.2 million.
Additionally, during 2016, the Company disposed of an encumbered property through foreclosure. This transaction resulted in a
net decrease in mortgage debt of $25.6 million (including fair market value adjustment of $0.4 million) and a gain on forgiveness of
debt of $3.1 million, which is included in Other income/(expense), net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
In addition to the public equity and debt markets as capital sources, the Company may, from time-to-time, obtain mortgage
financing on selected properties and construction loans to partially fund the capital needs of its real estate under development projects.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company had over 360 unencumbered property interests in its portfolio.
Dividends
In connection with its intention to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company expects to
continue paying regular dividends to its stockholders. These dividends will be paid from operating cash ﬂows. The Company’s Board
of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company’s dividend policy on a quarterly basis as the Board of Directors monitors sources
of capital and evaluates the impact of the economy and capital markets availability on operating fundamentals. Since cash used to pay
dividends reduces amounts available for capital investment, the Company generally intends to maintain a conservative dividend
payout ratio, reserving such amounts as it considers necessary for the expansion and renovation of shopping centers in its portfolio,
debt reduction, the acquisition of interests in new properties and other investments as suitable opportunities arise and such other
factors as the Board of Directors considers appropriate. Cash dividends paid were $474.0 million in 2016, $455.8 million in 2015 and
$427.9 million in 2014.
Although the Company receives substantially all of its rental payments on a monthly basis, it generally intends to continue paying
dividends quarterly. Amounts accumulated in advance of each quarterly distribution will be invested by the Company in short—term
money market or other suitable instruments. On October 25, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors declared an increased quarterly
cash dividend of $0.27 per common share, an annualized increase of 5.9%, payable to shareholders of record on January 3, 2017,
which was paid on January 15, 2017. Additionally, on February 2, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $0.27 per common share payable to shareholders of record on April 5, 2017, which is scheduled to be paid on April 17,
2017.
The Board of Directors also declared quarterly dividends with respect to the Company’s various series of cumulative redeemable
preferred shares (Class 1, Class J and Class K). All dividends on the preferred shares are scheduled to be paid on April 17, 2017, to
shareholders of record on April 4, 2017, with an ex—dividend date of March 31, 2017.
Other
The Company is subject to taxes on its activities in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico. In general, under local country law
applicable to the structures the Company has in place and applicable treaties, the repatriation of cash to the Company from its
subsidiaries and joint ventures in Canada, Puerto Rico and Mexico generally are not subject to withholding tax. The Company is
subject to and also includes in its tax provision non-U.S. income taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S.
These investments are held by the Company at the REIT level and not in the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiary. Accordingly, the
Company does not expect a U.S. income tax impact associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings from the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries.
