Based on the Company’s variable-rate debt balances, interest expense would have increased by $3.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016, if short-term interest rates were 1.0% higher.
The following table presents the Company’s foreign investments and respective cumulated translation adjustments (“CTA”) as of
December 31, 2016. Investment amounts are shown in their respective local currencies and the US. dollar equivalents, CTA balances
are shown in US. dollars:
Foreign Investment (in millions)
Country Local Currency; US. Dollars _ CTA Gain
[ Mexican real estate investments (MXN) 181.4 39 14.3 $ - I
Canadian real estate investments (CAD) 47.5 $ 35.3 $ 6.3
The Company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Currency ﬂuctuations between local currency and the US. dollar, for investments for which the Company has determined that the
local currency is the functional currency, for the period in which the Company held its investment result in a CTA. This CTA is
recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The CTA amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing ﬂuctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates.
Changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Any change could have a
favorable or unfavorable impact on the Company’s CTA balance. The Company’s aggregate CTA gain balance at December 31,
2016, is $6.3 million.
Under GAAP, the Company is required to release CTA balances into earnings when the Company has substantially liquidated its
investment in a foreign entity. The Company may, in the near term, substantially liquidate its remaining investment in Canada, which
will require the then unrealized gain on foreign currency translation to be recognized as earnings.
