NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
leases, amongst other financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 also modifies the impairment model for available-for—sale debt
securities and expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the
allowance for losses. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those fiscal years, with early application of the guidance permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position and/or results of operations.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). The update simplifies several aspects of accounting for employee share-
based payment transactions for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and
statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash ﬂows. The ASU is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early
adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
and/or results of operations.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which sets out the principles for the
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). The new
standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of
whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense
is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required
to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their
classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases
today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing
guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 supersedes the previous leases standard,
Leases (Topic 840). The standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company
continues to evaluate the effect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company’s financial position and/or results of
operations. However, the Company currently believes that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will not have a material impact for
operating leases where it is a lessor and will continue to record revenues from rental properties for its operating leases on a
straight-line basis. However, for leases where the Company is a lessee, primarily for the Company’s ground leases and
administrative office leases, the Company will be required to record a lease liability and a right of use asset on its Consolidated
Balance Sheets at fair value upon adoption. In addition, direct internal leasing overhead costs will continue to be capitalized,
however, indirect internal leasing overhead costs previously capitalized will be expensed under the ASU 2016—02.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis
(“ASU 2015-02”). ASU 2015-02 focuses to minimize situations under previously existing guidance in which a reporting entity
was required to consolidate another legal entity in which that reporting entity did not have: (1) the ability through contractual
rights to act primarily on its own behalf; (2) ownership of the majority of the legal entity's voting rights; or (3) the exposure to a
majority of the legal entity's economic benefits. ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they
should consolidate certain legal entities. Legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. ASU
2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material effect
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40):
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”), which requires
management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial
doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued
and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods
thereafter, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU
2014-09 is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of
goods or services to a customer at an amount reﬂecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or
services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a ﬁlll retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. ASU
2014-09 was anticipated to be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and early adoption was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date (“ASU 2015-14”), which delayed the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by
