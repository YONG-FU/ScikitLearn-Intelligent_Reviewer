Realizability 0f Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Positions
The Company is subject to federal, state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its TRS activities and
subject to local taxes on certain non-U.S. investments. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method,
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period
when the changes are enacted.
A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on the evidence
available, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.
The Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that
evidence, a valuation allowance is needed. Information about an enterprise's current financial position and its results of operations for the
current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years. The Company must use judgment
in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence. The Company’s reported net earnings are directly affected by
management’s judgement in determining a valuation allowance.
The Company recognizes and measures benefits for uncertain tax positions, which requires significant judgment from
management. Although the Company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given
that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and
circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. Changes in the recognition or measurement of
uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the Company’s income tax expense in the period in which a
change is made, which could have a material impact on operating results (see Footnote 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Form 10-K).

(1) Revenues from rental properties increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2016 and 2015, providing
incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, of $57.4 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015 and (ii) the completion of certain
redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, providing incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, of $17.4
million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of $66.9 million from properties sold during 2016 and
2015.
(2) Rental property expenses include (i) rent expense relating to ground lease payments for which the Company is the lessee, (ii) real estate tax expense for
consolidated properties for which the Company has a controlling ownership interest and (iii) operating and maintenance expense, which consists of property
related costs including repairs and maintenance costs, roof repair, landscaping, parking lot repair, snow removal, utilities, property insurance costs, security and
various other property related expenses. Rental property expenses decreased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the
corresponding period in 2015, primarily due to the disposition of properties during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by the acquisition of properties during 2016 and
2015.
(3) Depreciation and amortization increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, primarily due to operating
property acquisitions during 2016 and 2015 and write—offs relating to the Company’s redevelopment projects in 2016, partially offset by property dispositions.
Management and other fee income decreased $3.9 million to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to
$22.3 million for the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to (i) the sale of properties within various
joint venture investments and the acquisition of partnership interests in joint ventures by the Company during 2016 and 2015, and (ii)
the recognition of enhancement fee income related to the Company’s prior investment in InTown Suites of $1.2 million during 2015.
