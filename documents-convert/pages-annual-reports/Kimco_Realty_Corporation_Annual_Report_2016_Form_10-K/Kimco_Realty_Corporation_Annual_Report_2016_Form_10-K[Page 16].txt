Developing Leadership and Innovation to Drive Sustainable Growth
In the end, any strategic plan is only as good as the people who are called upon to execute it. Our commitment
to Kimco's 2020 Vision is bolstered by our confidence in Kimco's talented team of associates. Our senior
management team has a breadth and depth of experience that is unmatched in the industry. We are committed
to building on this foundation and fostering a spirit of innovation by mentoring and cultivating the next
generation of leaders within the company. Kimco's 90—day mentoring program pairs new employees with
experienced employees to help ease the transition. The company sponsors almost 24,000 hours of training per
year, or more than 43 average hours annually per employee. Programs such as Leaders Advancing Business
Solutions [LABS] help develop future leaders by selecting people from all parts of the company and bringing
them together with senior management to brainstorm innovative ways to increase revenue, reduce expenses and
grow profits.
Kimco works to foster leadership skills and drive innovation not just inside the company
but outside as well, in the local communities where we operate, and in the REIT industry.
For example, our Kimco Entrepreneurs Year Start [KEYS] program offers qualified new entrepreneurs a free year
of rent, with the option to stay in the space for the next five years at market rent if they are successful. This
program enriches local communities by helping to build and grow small businesses, including veteran, minority
and women—owned retailers.
We view each of our centers as a local business, which is why we strive to be a good corporate citizen and
improve our local communities. Our Community Connection program provides our employees with paid time off
each year to volunteer in their communities. Participants volunteer for the causes that are important to them,
which have included disaster relief, hunger, medical research, home building and youth mentoring. Employees
are encouraged to serve together to maximize their impact and foster team spirit.
