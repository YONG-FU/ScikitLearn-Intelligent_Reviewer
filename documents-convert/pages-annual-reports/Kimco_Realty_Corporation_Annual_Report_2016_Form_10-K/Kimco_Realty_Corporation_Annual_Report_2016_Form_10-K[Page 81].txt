Other Investments
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 50.0% interest in a
property previously held in a joint venture in which the Company had a noncontrolling interest for a gross purchase price of $23.0
million. Upon signing this contract, which closed in January 2016, the Company effectively gained control of the entity and is
entitled to all economics and risk of loss and as such, the Company consolidated this property pursuant to the FASB’s
Consolidation guidance. Additionally, as the Company was required to purchase the partners interest at a fixed and determinable
price in January 2016, the Company recognized $11.5 million within Other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets at December 31, 2015. Based upon the Company’s intent to redevelop a portion of the property, the Company allocated
$8.4 million of the gross purchase price to Real estate under development on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
remaining $14.6 million was allocated to Operating real estate on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
