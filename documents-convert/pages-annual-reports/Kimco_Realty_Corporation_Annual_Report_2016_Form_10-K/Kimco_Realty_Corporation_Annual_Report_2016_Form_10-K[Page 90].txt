Senior Unsecured Notes / MIN —
The Company’s supplemental indentures governing its MTN and Senior Unsecured Notes contain covenants whereby the
Company is subject to maintaining (a) certain maximum leverage ratios on both unsecured senior corporate and secured debt,
minimum debt service coverage ratios and minimum equity levels, (b) certain debt service ratios and (c) certain asset to debt
ratios. In addition, the Company is restricted from paying dividends in amounts that exceed by more than $26.0 million the ﬁnds
from operations, as defined, generated through the end of the calendar quarter most recently completed prior to the declaration of
such dividend; however, this dividend limitation does not apply to any distributions necessary to maintain the Company's
qualification as a REIT providing the Company is in compliance with its total leverage limitations. The Company was in
compliance with all of the covenants as of December 31, 2016.
