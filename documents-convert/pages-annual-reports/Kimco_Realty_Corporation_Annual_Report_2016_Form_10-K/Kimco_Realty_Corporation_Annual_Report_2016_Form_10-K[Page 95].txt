KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized impairment charges of $45.5 million, of which $0.1 million,
before noncontrolling interests and income taxes, is included in discontinued operations. These impairment charges consist of (i)
$20.2 million related to adjustments to property carrying values, (ii) $10.2 million related to the sale of operating properties, (iii)
$9.0 million related to a cost method investment, (iv) $5.3 million related to certain investments in other real estate investments
and (v) $0.8 million related to marketable debt securities investments.
The Company’s estimated fair values for the year ended December 31, 2015, as it relates to property carrying values were
primarily based upon (i) estimated sales prices from third party offers based on signed contracts or letters of intent (this method
was used to determine $5.7 million of the $20.2 million in impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015),
for which the Company does not have access to the unobservable inputs used to determine these estimated fair values, (ii) third
party appraisals (this method was used to determine $8.9 million of the $20.2 million in impairments recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2015) and (iii) discounted cash ﬂow models (this method was used to determine $5.6 million of the $20.2
million in impairments recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015). The discounted cash ﬂow models include all
estimated cash inﬂows and outﬂows over a specified holding period. These cash ﬂows were comprised of unobservable inputs
which include forecasted revenues and expenses based upon market conditions and expectations for growth. The capitalization
rates primarily ranging from 8.25% to 8.5% and discount rates primarily ranging from 9.25% to 9.75% which were utilized in the
models were based upon observable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for
each respective investment.
Based on these inputs the Company determined that its valuation of these investments was classified within Level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. The property carrying value impairment charges resulted from the Company’s efforts to market certain assets
and management’s assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions.
