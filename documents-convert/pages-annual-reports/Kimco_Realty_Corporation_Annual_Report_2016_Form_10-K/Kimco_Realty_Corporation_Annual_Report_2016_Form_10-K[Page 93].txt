KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
The Company owns a shopping center located in Bay Shore, NY, which was acquired in 2006 with the issuance of 647,758
redeemable Class B Units at a par value of $37.24 per unit. The units accrue a return equal to the Company’s common stock
dividend and are redeemable for cash by the holder or at the Company’s option, shares of the Company’s common stock at a ratio
of 1:1. These units are callable by the Company any time after April 3, 2026, and are included in Noncontrolling interests on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2007, 30,000 units, or $1.1 million par value, of the Class B Units were
redeemed and at the Company’s option settled in cash. As of both December 31, 2016 and 2015, noncontrolling interest relating
to the remaining Class B Units was $26.5 million.
Noncontrolling interests also includes 138,015 convertible units issued during 2006 by the Company, which were valued at $5.3
million, including a fair market value adjustment of $0.3 million, related to an interest acquired in an office building located in
Albany, NY. These units are currently redeemable at the option of the holder for cash or at the option of the Company for the
Company’s common stock at a ratio of 1:1. The holder is entitled to a distribution equal to the dividend rate of the Company’s
common stock. The Company is restricted from disposing of these assets, other than through a tax free transaction, through
January 2017.
The following table presents the change in the redemption value of the Redeemable noncontrolling interests for the years ended

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired its partner’s interest in three previously consolidated joint
ventures for $31.6 million. The Company continues to consolidate these entities as there was no change in control from these
transactions. The purchase of the remaining interests resulted in an aggregate decrease in noncontrolling interest of $25.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a net decrease of $6.4 million to the Company’s Paid-in capital, during 2015.
16. Fair Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments:
All financial instruments of the Company are reﬂected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts which, in
management’s estimation, based upon an interpretation of available market information and valuation methodologies, reasonably
approximate their fair values except those listed below, for which fair values are disclosed. The valuation method used to
estimate fair value for fixed-rate and variable-rate debt is based on discounted cash ﬂow analyses, with assumptions that include
credit spreads, market yield curves, trading activity, loan amounts and debt maturities. The fair values for marketable securities
are based on published values, securities dealers’ estimated market values or comparable market sales. Such fair value estimates
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized upon disposition.
As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the FASB’s Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on
market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2
of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified
within Level 3 of the hierarchy).
The following are financial instruments for which the Company’s estimate of fair value differs from the carrying amounts (in
thousands):
