purposes, including (i) funding specific liquidity requirements in its business, including property acquisitions, development and
redevelopment costs and (ii) managing the Company's debt maturities.

credit facility.
Credit Facility —
The Company had a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with a group of banks, which was
scheduled to expire in March 2018 with two additional six month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company’s
discretion, to March 2019. The Credit Facility, which could be increased to $2.25 billion through an accordion feature, accrued
interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 92.5 basis points (1.67% as of December 31, 2016) on drawn funds. In addition, the Credit
Facility included a $500 million sub-limit which provided the Company the opportunity to borrow in alternative currencies
including Canadian Dollars, British Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen or Euros. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, the
Company, among other things, was subject to covenants requiring the maintenance of (i) maximum leverage ratios on both
unsecured and secured debt and (ii) minimum interest and fixed coverage ratios. The Company was in compliance with all of the
covenants as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Credit Facility had a balance of $25.0 million outstanding and
$0.7 million appropriated for letters of credit.
In February 2017, the Company closed on a new $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks, which is
scheduled to expire in March 2021, with two additional six month options to extend the maturity date, at the Company’s
discretion, to March 2022. This new credit facility, which accrues interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points, could be
increased to $2.75 billion through an accordion feature. The new credit facility replaces the Company’s $1.75 billion Credit
Facility that was scheduled to mature in March 2018. In addition, the facility includes a $500.0 million sub-limit which provides
the company the opportunity to borrow in alternative currencies including Canadian Dollars, British Pounds Sterling, Japanese
Yen or Euros. Under this new credit facility, the Company continues to be subject to certain covenants as in the Credit Facility
described above.

(95 basis points at December 31, 2016) to LIBOR or at the Company’s option at a base rate as defined per the agreement (1.60%
at December 31, 2016). The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay the Company’s $400.0 million term loan, which
was scheduled to mature in April 2015 (with two additional one-year extension options) and bore interest at LIBOR plus 105
basis points, and for general corporate purposes. During November 2016, the Company repaid $400.0 million of borrowings
