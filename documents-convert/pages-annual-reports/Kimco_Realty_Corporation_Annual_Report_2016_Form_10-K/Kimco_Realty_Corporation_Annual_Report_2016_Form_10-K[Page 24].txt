The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the
contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company
as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company
completed its initial public stock offering (the "IPO") in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January
1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"). If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a
REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders
equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined under the Code. In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland
corporation. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap
companies, most of which are US. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class I Depositary Shares, Class I Depositary
Shares and Class K Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”,
“KIMprI”, “KIMprJ” and “KIMer”, respectively.
The Company’s initial growth resulted primarily from real estate under development and the construction of shopping centers.
Subsequently, the Company revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers and continued its
expansion across the nation. The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of
various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management
fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics. The Company
continued its geographic expansion with investments in Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru; however, during 2013,
based upon a perceived change in market conditions, the Company began its efforts to exit its investments in Mexico and South
America. During 2015, the Company began its efforts to exit its investments in Canada. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had
essentially sold all of its operating properties in Canada, substantially liquidated its investments in Mexico and had completely exited
South America by liquidating its investments in Chile, Brazil and Peru. The Company’s revenues and equity in income (including

completion, (ii) retail real estate management and disposition services, which primarily focused on leasing and disposition strategies for real
estate property interests of both healthy and distressed retailers and (iii) the Company’s investment in AB Acquisition, LLC, which consists
