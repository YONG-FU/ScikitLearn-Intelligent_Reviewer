Effects of Inﬂation
Many of the Company's leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inﬂation. Such provisions include
clauses enabling the Company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants' gross sales above pre-
determined thresholds, which generally increase as prices rise, and/or escalation clauses, which generally increase rental rates during
the terms of the leases. Such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar
inﬂation indices. In addition, many of the Company's leases are for terms of less than 10 years, which permits the Company to seek to
increase rents to market rates upon renewal. Most of the Company's leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating
expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to
increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inﬂation. The Company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements and/or
foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its ﬂoating-rate debt
and ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
