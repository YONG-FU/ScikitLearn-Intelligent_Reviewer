income of $4.9 million resulting from a cash distribution received in excess of the Company’s carrying basis in 2015, (ii) a decrease in
income resulting from the sale of the Company’s leveraged lease portfolio of $3.8 million during 2015 and (iii) a decrease of $2.8
million in earnings from the Company’s Preferred Equity Program during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily resulting from
the sale of the Company’s interests in certain preferred equity investments during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by (iv) an increase of
$3.3 million in profit participation from the Company’s Preferred Equity Program from capital transactions during the year ended
December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015.
During 2016, the Company disposed of 30 consolidated operating properties and two out-parcels, in separate transactions, for an
aggregate sales price of $378.7 million. These transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of $86.8 million, after income tax expense,
and aggregate impairment charges of $37.2 million which were taken prior to sale, before income tax benefit of $10.0 million.
During 2015, the Company disposed of 89 consolidated operating properties and eight out-parcels, in separate transactions, for an
aggregate sales price of $492.5 million. These transactions resulted in an aggregate gain of $143.6 million, after income tax expense,
and aggregate impairment charges of $10.2 million, before income tax expense of $2.3 million. Additionally, during 2015, the
Company disposed of its remaining operating property in Chile for a sales price of $51.3 million. This transaction resulted in the
release of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $19.6 million due to the Company’s liquidation of its investment in Chile,
partially offset by a gain on sale of $1.8 million, after income tax expense.
Net income attributable to the Company was $378.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $894.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2015. On a diluted per share basis, net income available to the Company for the year ended
December 31, 2016 was $0.79 as compared to $2.00 for the year ended December 31, 2015. These changes are primarily attributable
to (i) a decrease in equity in income of joint ventures, net, resulting from gains on sales of properties within various joint venture
investments during 2015, (ii) a decrease in gain on change in control of interests, net related to the fair value adjustment associated
with the Company’s previously held equity interests in properties acquired from various joint ventures during 2016 and 2015, (iii) an
increase in impairments of operating properties during 2016, (iv) an increase in early extinguishment of debt charges resulting from
the prepayment of secured and unsecured debt by the Company, (v) a decrease in gains on sale of operating properties, (vi) a decrease
in gain on sale of marketable securities during 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, (vii) an increase in provision
for income taxes due to a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets resulting from the merger of KRS into a wholly-owned LLC
of the Company and (viii) a decrease in gains through the Company’s preferred equity program and other investments, partially offset
by (ix) a decrease in interest expense and (x) incremental earnings due to the acquisition of operating properties during 2016 and 2015
and increased profitability from the Company’s operating properties.

(1) Revenues from rental properties increased primarily from the combined effect of (i) the acquisition of operating properties during 2015 and 2014, providing
incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, of $179.9 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 and (ii) the completion of
certain redevelopment projects, tenant buyouts and net growth in the current portfolio, providing incremental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, of
$23.5 million, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in revenues of $17.8 million from properties sold during 2015

various other property related expenses. Rental property expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in
2014, primarily due to the acquisitions of properties during 2015 and 2014, partially offset by the disposition of properties in 2015, which resulted in (i) a net
increase in real estate taxes of $22.5 million, (ii) a net increase in repairs and maintenance costs of $9.7 million, (iii) a net increase in property services of $4.8
million, (iv) a net increase in snow removal costs of $3.6 million, (v) a net increase in professional fees of $2.4 million and (vi) a net increase in insurance expense
of $3.1 million, due to an increase in insurance claims.
(3) Depreciation and amortization increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014, primarily due to operating
property acquisitions during 2015 and 2014 and amounts relating to the Company’s redevelopment projects in 2015, partially offset by property dispositions.
