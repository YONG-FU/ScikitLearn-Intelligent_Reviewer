Holders: The number of holders of record of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, was 2,292 as of January
31, 2017.
Dividends: Since the IPO, the Company has paid regular quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders. While the Company intends
to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends, future dividend declarations will be paid at the discretion of the Board of
Directors and will depend on the actual cash ﬂows of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. The
Company’s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate the Company’s dividend policy on a quarterly basis as they monitor sources
of capital and evaluate operating ﬁJndamentals. The Company is required by the Code to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable
income. The actual cash ﬂow available to pay dividends will be affected by a number of factors, including the revenues received from
rental properties, the operating expenses of the Company, the interest expense on its borrowings, the ability of lessees to meet their
obligations to the Company, the ability to refinance near—term debt maturities and any unanticipated capital expenditures.
The Company has determined that the $1.02 dividend per common share paid during 2016 consisted of 62% ordinary income, an
8% return of capital and 30% capital gain to its stockholders. The $0.96 dividend per common share paid during 2015 consisted of
100% capital gain to its stockholders.
In addition to its common stock offerings, the Company has capitalized the growth in its business through the issuance of
unsecured fixed and ﬂoating-rate medium-term notes, underwritten bonds, unsecured bank debt, mortgage debt and construction
loans, convertible preferred stock and perpetual preferred stock. Borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility have also
been an interim source of funds to both finance the purchase of properties and other investments and meet any short-term working
capital requirements. The various instruments governing the Company's issuance of its unsecured public debt, bank debt, mortgage
debt and preferred stock impose certain restrictions on the Company with regard to dividends, voting, liquidation and other
preferential rights available to the holders of such instruments. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations'l and Footnotes 13, 14 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form lO-K.
The Company does not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of its Class I Preferred Stock, Class I Preferred
Stock and Class K Preferred Stock, the financial covenants contained in its public bond indentures, as amended, its term loan, or its
revolving credit agreements will have an adverse impact on the Company's ability to pay dividends in the normal course to its
common stockholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain its qualification as a REIT.
The Company maintains a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which common and
preferred stockholders and other interested investors may elect to automatically reinvest their dividends to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock or, through optional cash payments, purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company
may, from time-to-time, either (i) purchase shares of its common stock in the open market or (ii) issue new shares of its common stock
for the purpose of fulfilling its obligations under the Plan.
