Which is why we continue to believe we are in the sweet spot when it comes to retail real estate. Indeed,
if you look at many of our top tenants, their performance has been outstanding. Home Depot, our
second largest tenant, recently reported excellent earnings and an increase in US. same store comp
sales of over 6%. And our high—credit, off—price retailers have been on fire. Burlington Stores' stock
price keeps hitting new highs, while TJX, our largest tenant, and Ross Stores continue to outperform. It
may be hard to believe but the market cap of TJX is nearly double the combined market cap of Macy's,
Nordstrom, Dillard's, JC Penney, Sears, Saks and Lord & Taylor. The demand for our product was on
prominent display at the recent open—air shopping center conference in Miami where our team met with
many retailers who expressed strong interest in our centers.
Finally, our Vision included putting together a dynamic team to lead Kimco's next generation. To that
end we added Mary Hogan Preusse to our Board of Directors. Mary brings her unique insight and
perspective on Kimco and our industry as a whole. The appointments of Ross Cooper and David
Jamieson to President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, solidify our bright future. Along with
Conor and Glenn Cohen, our Chief Financial Officer, Ross and David share the passion, commitment
and industry that will deliver the results that our shareholders expect and deserve. Conor, Ross and
David have spent their entire careers at Kimco and work seamlessly together. in his brief tenure as
CEO, Conor has already established himself as a strong leader, great motivator and team builder.
Glenn has been with Kimco for over 20 years. He possesses a keen antenna that senses perturbations
in the capital markets and is the guardian of our balance sheet. Together, this team exudes trust and
has the confidence and respect of our employees, tenants, business partners, and investors.
Sincerely,
