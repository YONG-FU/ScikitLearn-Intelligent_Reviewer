(1) Reﬂects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period, which would have a dilutive effect on FFO.
FF 0 would be increased by $229 and $217 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $881 and $781 for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effect of other certain convertible units would have an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income
from continuing operations per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversion has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share
calculations.
(2) Related to gains, impairment and deprecation on operating properties, where applicable.
(3) Related to transaction (income)/expense, where applicable.
(4) Includes cumulative foreign currency translation net loss of $18.8 million due to the liquidation of the Company's Chilean Portfolio as follows: (i) $19.6
million of loss in Gain on disposition of operating property, net, partially offset by (ii) $0.8 million of gain in Gain on disposition of joint venture operating
properties and change in control of interests.
U.S. Same Property Net Operating Income (“U.S. same property NOI”)
U.S. same property NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and
should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. U.S. same property NOI
is considered by management to be an important performance measure of the Company’s operations and management believes that it
is frequently used by securities analysts and investors as a measure of the Company’s operating performance because it includes only
the net operating income of US. properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior year reporting periods including
those properties under redevelopment and excludes properties under development and pending stabilization. Properties are deemed
stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project’s inclusion in operating real estate. U.S. same
property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the
particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.
