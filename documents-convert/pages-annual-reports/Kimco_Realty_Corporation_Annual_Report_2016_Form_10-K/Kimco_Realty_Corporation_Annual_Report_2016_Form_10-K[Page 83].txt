(1) The year ended December 31, 2014, includes $92.9 million related to the release of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss due to the
Company’s substantial liquidation of its investment in Mexico.
7. Impairments:
Management assesses on a continuous basis whether there are any indicators, including property operating performance, changes
in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that the value of the Company’s assets (including any related
amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the
asset would be adjusted to an amount to reﬂect the estimated fair value of the asset.
During 2014, the Company implemented a plan to accelerate the disposition of certain U.S. properties and substantially liquidated
its investment in Mexico, which resulted in the release of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss. These disposition plans
effectively shortened the Company’s anticipated hold period for these properties and as a result the Company recognized
impairment charges on various consolidated operating properties (see Footnote 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for fair value disclosure).
The Company’s efforts to market certain assets and management’s assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential
transactions and/or the property hold period resulted in the Company recognizing impairment charges for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as follows (in millions):
