22. Income Taxes:
The Company elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with the Code commencing with its taxable year which began January
1, 1992. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet several organizational and operational requirements, including a
requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. Management intends to adhere
to these requirements and maintain the Company’s REIT status. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to
corporate federal income tax, provided that dividends to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income. If
the Company failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be permitted to elect REIT status for four subsequent taxable
years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on its income
and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-
REIT activities managed through TRSs is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. The Company is also subject to local
taxes on certain Non-US. investments.
