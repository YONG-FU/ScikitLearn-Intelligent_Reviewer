underlying properties within the Company’s preferred equity investments, during 2015 and 2014. The Company believes it will not recover its

and the duration of the decline and determined that the decline was other-than—temporary. Impairment charges were recognized based upon the
calculation of the investments’ estimated fair value.

properties in the amount of $92.9 million, before noncontrolling interest of $5.8 million.
In addition to the impairment charges above, the Company recognized pretax impairment charges during 2016, 2015 and 2014 of
$15.0 million, $22.2 million, and $54.5 million (including $47.3 million in cumulative foreign currency translation loss relating to
the Company’s substantial liquidation of its investment in Mexico), respectively, relating to certain properties held by various
unconsolidated joint ventures in which the Company holds noncontrolling interests. These impairment charges are included in
Equity in income of joint ventures, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income (see Footnote 8 of the Notes to
