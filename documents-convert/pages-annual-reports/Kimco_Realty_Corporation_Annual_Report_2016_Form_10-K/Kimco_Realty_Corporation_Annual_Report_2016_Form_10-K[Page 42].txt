General and administrative costs include employee-related expenses (salaries, bonuses, equity awards, benefits, severance costs
and payroll taxes), professional fees, office rent, travel expense and other company—specific expenses. General and administrative
expenses decreased $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the corresponding period in 2015, primarily
due to a decrease in severance costs and a reduction in professional fees.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized impairment charges related solely to adjustments to property
carrying values of $93.3 million for which the Company’s estimated fair value was primarily based on third party appraisals and third
party offers through signed contracts, letters of intent or discounted cash ﬂow models. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the
Company recognized impairment charges of $45.5 million, before noncontrolling interests and income taxes, of which $0.1 million is
included in discontinued operations. The 2015 impairment charges consisted of (i) $30.3 million related to adjustments to property
carrying values, (ii) $9.0 million relating to a cost method investment, (iii) $5.3 million related to certain investments in other real
estate investments and (iv) $0.8 million related to marketable debt securities investments. The adjustments to property carrying values
for 2016 and 2015 were recognized in connection with the Company’s efforts to market for sale certain properties and management’s
assessment as to the likelihood and timing of such potential transactions and the anticipated hold period for such properties. Certain of
the calculations to determine fair value utilized unobservable inputs and as such are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Interest, dividends and other investment income decreased $37.6 million to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as
compared to $39.1 million for the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the sale of certain marketable
securities during the year ended December 31, 2015, which resulted in an aggregate gain of $39.9 million.
Interest expense decreased $26.4 million to $192.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $218.9 million
for the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of lower levels of borrowings and lower interest rates on
borrowings during 2016, as compared to 2015.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred early extinguishment of debt charges aggregating $45.7 million
in connection with the optional make-whole provisions of unsecured notes that were repaid prior to maturity and prepayment penalties
on a mortgage encumbering 10 operating properties, which the Company also paid prior to the scheduled maturity date. See
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional details.
Provision for income taxes, net increased $12.3 million to $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to
$60.2 million for the corresponding period in 2015. This increase is primarily due to (i) an increase in the Company’s valuation
allowance of $63.5 million as a result of the Company’s merger of its taxable REIT subsidiary into a wholly owned LLC of the
Company, partially offset by (ii) a decrease in foreign tax expense of $26.1 million primarily relating to fewer sales of unconsolidated
properties within the Company’s Canadian portfolio which were subject to foreign taxes at a consolidated reporting entity level during
2016, as compared to 2015, (iii) an increase in tax benefit of $13.4 million related to impairment charges recognized during 2016, as
compared to 2015, (iv) a decrease of $4.5 million in tax expense related to gains recognized during 2015, as compared to 2016, (v) a
decrease of $3.0 million in tax expense on operations due to fewer properties in the taxable REIT subsidiary as a result of the TRS
Merger, (vi) a decrease of $2.0 million resulting from the favorable settlement of a tax audit during 2016 and (vii) a decrease in tax
expense of $2.0 million relating to equity income recognized in connection with the Company’s Albertsons investment during 2015.
Equity in income of joint ventures, net decreased $261.7 million to $218.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as
compared to $480.4 million for the corresponding period in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to (i) a decrease in gains of $248.1
million resulting from fewer sales of properties and interests within various joint venture investments, including the Company’s
Canadian Portfolio, during 2016, as compared to 2015 and (ii) lower equity in income of $26.0 million resulting from the sales of
properties within various joint venture investments and the acquisition of partnership interests in joint ventures by the Company
during 2016 and 2015, partially offset by (iii) a decrease in impairment charges of $7.2 million recognized during 2016, as compared
to 2015.
During 2016, the Company acquired nine operating properties and one development project from joint ventures in which the
