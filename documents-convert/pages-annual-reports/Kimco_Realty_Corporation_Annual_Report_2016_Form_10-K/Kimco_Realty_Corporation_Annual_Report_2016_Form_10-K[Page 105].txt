KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
The Company previously had unrecognized tax benefits reported as deferred tax assets primarily related to book to tax timing
differences for depreciation expense on its Canadian real estate operating properties. With respect to the Company’s uncertain tax
positions in Canada and in accordance with ASU 2013-11 "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax
Beneﬁt When a Net Operating LOSS Carry/forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists," (“ASU 2013-11”),
the uncertain tax position liabilities in Canada were netted against these deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016, the
Company, due to the sale of certain operating real estate properties in Canada, no longer had these related deferred tax assets to
net against the related deferred tax liability and thus, the amount of its liability increased for uncertain tax positions associated
with its Canadian operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s Canadian uncertain tax positions aggregated $4.9
million.
The Company and its subsidiaries had been under audit by the US. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to taxable
years 2004-2009. The IRS proposed, pursuant to Section 482 of the Code, to disallow a capital loss claimed by KRS on the
disposition of common shares of Valad Property Ltd., an Australian publicly listed company, and to assert a 100 percent
“penalty” tax on the Company pursuant to Section 857(b)(7) of the Code in the amount of $40.9 million with respect to its 2009
taxable year. In 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries favorably settled all matters relating to the audit, agreeing to a net refund
of $0.1 million. In connection with this favorable settlement, the Company released its uncertain tax position liability of $2.0
million.
In August 2016, the Mexican Tax Authority issued tax assessments for various wholly-owned entities of the Company that had
previously held interests in operating properties in Mexico. These assessments relate to certain interest expense and withholding
tax items subject to the United States-Mexico Income Tax Convention (the “Treaty”). The assessments are for the 2010 tax year
and include amounts for taxes aggregating $33.7 million, interest aggregating $16.5 million and penalties aggregating $11.4
million. The Company believes that it has operated in accordance with the Treaty provisions and has therefore concluded that no
amounts are payable with respect to this matter. The Company has submitted appeals for these assessments and the US.
Competent Authority (Department of Treasury) is representing the Company regarding this matter with the Mexican Competent
Authority. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position and believes it will prevail, however this outcome cannot be
assured.
