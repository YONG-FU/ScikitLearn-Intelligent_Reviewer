Certain amounts in the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation, in the table above.
(a) All adjustments to "GAAP net income from REIT operations" are net of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest and taxable REIT
subsidiaries.
(b) In September 2013, the Internal Revenue Service released final Regulations governing when taxpayers must capitalize and depreciate costs for
acquiring, maintaining, repairing and replacing tangible property and when taxpayers must deduct such costs as repairs. Pursuant to these
Regulations the Company deducted certain expenditures that would previously have been capitalized for tax purposes. The Regulations also
allowed the Company to make an election to immediately deduct certain amounts that were capitalized in previous years but qualify as repairs
under the new Regulations. The Company made such election in 2015 and deducted approximately $85.9 million.
