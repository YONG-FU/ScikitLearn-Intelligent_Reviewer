2016 Operating Review
In the first year of Kimco's 2020 Vision, we positioned the company to provide steady
and reliable earnings growth and value creation in a changing retail environment.
Dear Fellow Shareholders and Associates:
In 2016, Kimco began implementing its 2020 Vision, a strategic five—year plan that is already positioning
the company for future success. We know from Kimco's 50+ year history that success in real estate requires a
long—term approach and the ability to stay the course in the face of cyclical market forces and unpredictable
economic events. Success also requires the foresight to anticipate and adapt to an ever—changing retail
environment. Based on our 2016 accomplishments, we are confident that Kimco is well on its way toward
achieving our Vision, and is well positioned for steady growth in net asset value [NAV], funds from operations
[FFO], and total shareholder return.
Kimco achieved solid financial and operating results in 2016, as FFO as adjusted, which excludes non-operating
impairments and transactional income and charges, rose 4.3 percent to $629.4 million, or $1.50 per diluted
share. This growth was accomplished notwithstanding the impact of significant disposition activity, and a
challenging retail environment that included the bankruptcy of Sports Authority. This success is a testament to
our high-quality portfolio, skillful balance sheet management and creative cost—saving initiatives.
