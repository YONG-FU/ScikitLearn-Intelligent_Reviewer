KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
(1) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company determined that $6.5 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of the Marketable securities estimated fair
value were classiﬁed within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and the remaining $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, were classified within Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy.
(2) The Company determined that its valuation of the Senior Unsecured Notes and MTNs were classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the Term
Loan and Credit Facility were classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
(3) The Company determined that its valuation of these Mortgages payable was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the FASB’s Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures guidance, including available for sale securities. The Company currently does not have non-financial assets and non—
financial liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value
hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The Company from time to time has used interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk. The fair values of interest rate swaps
are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the
discounted expected variable cash payments (or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of
future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. Based on these inputs, the Company
has determined that interest rate swap valuations are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The tables below present the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December
31, 2016 and 2015, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized impairment charges related solely to adjustments to property
carrying values of $93.3 million. The Company’s estimated fair values were primarily based upon estimated sales prices from
third party offers that were based on signed contracts, appraisals or letters of intent for which the Company does not have access
to the unobservable inputs used to determine these estimated fair values. For the appraisals, the capitalization rates primarily
range from 7.75% to 9.00% and discount rates primarily range from 9.25% to 12.17% which were utilized in the models based
upon unobservable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective
investment. Based on these inputs the Company determined that its valuation of these investments was classified within Level 3
of the fair value hierarchy.
