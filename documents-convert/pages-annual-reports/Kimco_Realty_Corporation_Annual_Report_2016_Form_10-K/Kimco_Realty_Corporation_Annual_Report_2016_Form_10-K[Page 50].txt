Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company paid off the $250.0 million unsecured term loan. The Company anticipates satisfying
the remaining maturities with a combination of operating cash ﬂows, its unsecured revolving credit facility, exercise of extension

and surety bonds outstanding.
The Company has accrued $5 .0 million of non-current uncertain tax positions and related interest under the provisions of the
authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for income taxes, which are included in Other liabilities on the Company’s

estimate regarding the timing of settlements with the relevant tax authorities, if any, cannot be made.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures
The Company has investments in various unconsolidated real estate joint ventures with varying structures. These joint ventures
primarily operate shopping center properties. Such arrangements are generally with third-party institutional investors and individuals.
The properties owned by the joint ventures are primarily financed with individual non-recourse mortgage loans, however, the
Company, on a selective basis, has obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures. As of December 31, 2016, the Company
did not guarantee any joint venture unsecured debt. Non-recourse mortgage debt is generally defined as debt whereby the lenders’
sole recourse with respect to borrower defaults is limited to the value of the property collateralized by the mortgage. The lender
generally does not have recourse against any other assets owned by the borrower or any of the constituent members of the borrower,
except for certain specified exceptions listed in the particular loan documents (see Footnote 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2016, these investments include the following joint ventures:
