Kimsouth —
Kimsouth Realty Inc. (“Kimsouth”) is a wholly—owned subsidiary of the Company. KRS AB Acquisition, LLC (the “ABS
Venture”) is a subsidiary of Kimsouth that has a noncontrolling interest in AB Acquisition, LLC (“AB Acquisition”), a joint
venture which owns Albertsons Inc. (“Albertsons”) and NAI Group Holdings Inc. (“NAI”). The Company holds a controlling
interest in the ABS Venture and consolidates this entity.
During January 2015, two new noncontrolling members were admitted into the ABS Venture, including Colony Capital, Inc. and
affiliates (“Colony”), after which the Company contributed $85.3 million and the two noncontrolling members contributed an
aggregate $105.0 million, of which Colony contributed $100.0 million, to the ABS Venture, which was subsequently contributed
to AB Acquisition to facilitate the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Safeway Inc. (“Safeway”). In January 2017,
Colony Capital, Inc. merged with NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. to form Colony
NorthStar, Inc. (“Colony NorthStar”). As a result, the ABS Venture now holds a combined 14.35% interest in AB Acquisition, of
which the Company holds a combined 9.8% ownership interest and Colony NorthStar holds a 4.3% ownership interest. Richard
B. Saltzman, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is the chief executive officer and president of Colony
NorthStar. The combined company of Albertsons, NAI and Safeway operates over 2,200 grocery stores across 33 states. The
Company continues to consolidate the ABS Venture as there was no change in control following the admission of the members
described above. As such, the Company recorded (i) the gross investment in Safeway of $190.3 million in Other assets on the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and accounts for this investment under the cost method of accounting (ii) a
noncontrolling interest of $65.0 million and (iii) an increase in Paid-in capital of $24.0 million, net of a deferred tax effect of
$16.0 million, representing the amount contributed by the newly admitted members in excess of their proportionate share of the
historic book value of the net assets of ABS Venture.
