21. Incentive Plans:
The Company accounts for equity awards in accordance with FASB’s Compensation — Stock Compensation guidance which
requires that all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and performance
shares, be recognized in the Statement of Income over the service period based on their fair values. Fair value is determined,
depending on the type of award, using either the Black—Scholes option pricing formula or the Monte Carlo method for
performance shares, both of which are intended to estimate the fair value of the awards at the grant date. Fair value of restricted
shares is calculated based on the price on the date of grant.

years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $31.1 million of total
