KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
one year making it effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
Subsequently, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal
versus Agent Considerations,” which further clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, and
in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying performance
obligations and licensing,” an update on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property.
Additionally, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016- 12, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope
improvements and practical expedients,” which includes amendments for enhanced clarification of the guidance. Early adoption
is permitted as of the original effective date. The Company’s revenue-producing contracts are primarily leases that are not within
the scope of this standard. As a result, the Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact on
the Company’s rental income. The Company continues to evaluate the effect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the
Company’s other sources of revenue. These include management and other fee income and reimbursement amounts the
Company receives from tenants for operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance and other common area maintenance.
However, the Company currently does not believe the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will significantly affect the timing of the
recognition of the Company’s management and other fee income and reimbursement revenue.
