(a) The effect of the assumed conversion of certain convertible units had an anti-dilutive effect upon the calculation of Income from continuing operations
per share. Accordingly, the impact of such conversions has not been included in the determination of diluted earnings per share calculations.
Additionally, there were 3,490,400, 5,300,680 and 7,137,120 stock options that were not dilutive as of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
The Company's unvested restricted share awards contain non-forfeitable rights to distributions or distribution equivalents. The
impact of the unvested restricted share awards on earnings per share has been calculated using the two-class method whereby
earnings are allocated to the unvested restricted share awards based on dividends declared and the unvested restricted shares'
participation rights in undistributed earnings.
