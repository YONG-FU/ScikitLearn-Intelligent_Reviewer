Strong Balance Sheet Provides Optimal Financial Flexibility
As part of Kimco's 2020 Vision, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and capital structure to
maximize our financial flexibility. Our BBB+/Baa1 investment grade ratings afford us meaningful access to
capital at highly attractive rates. We also continue to lower our Net Debt to EBITDA ratio as we pursue an
unsecured credit rating upgrade to A-/A3.
During 2016, Kimco demonstrated its ability to access capital from multiple sources, including the "At the
Market" equity program set up in 2015, which generated net proceeds of $285 million in 2016. In February
2017, we completed the renewal and expansion of our revolving credit facility, increasing the facility to $2.25
billion from $1.75 billion and extending the maturity date to 2022. We also took advantage of the favorable
interest rate environment in 2016 to issue $1.4 billion in new unsecured notes with a weighted average
term of 16.3 years, while at the same time reducing consolidated debt by $310 million. As a result of these
efforts, Kimco's weighted average debt maturity profile increased from 5.3 years to 8.7 years, one of the
longest in the REIT industry.
Through the use of our free cash flow and the sale of certain assets, we also took meaningful steps to
reduce our secured debt exposure, the result being a portfolio in which 70 percent of properties are
currently unencumbered.
Kimco's strong balance sheet and stable, predictable earnings support consistent dividend growth. In 2016,
we raised our quarterly common stock dividend for the sixth consecutive year. The common dividend
increased 5.9 percent to $1.08 on an annualized basis, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the low 70
percent range.
