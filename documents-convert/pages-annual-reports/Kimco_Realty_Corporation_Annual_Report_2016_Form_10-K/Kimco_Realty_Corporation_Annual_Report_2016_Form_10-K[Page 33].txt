(1) Leases currently under month to month lease or in process of renewal
During 2016, the Company executed 935 leases totaling over 6.8 million square feet in the Company’s consolidated operating
portfolio comprised of 344 new leases and 591 renewals and options. The leasing costs associated with these leases are estimated to
aggregate $58.4 million or $29.81 per square foot. These costs include $46.4 million of tenant improvements and $12.0 million of
leasing commissions. The average rent per square foot on new leases was $18.85 and on renewals and options was $14.97. The
Company will seek to obtain rents that are higher than amounts within its expiring leases, however, there are many variables and
uncertainties which can significantly affect the leasing market at any time; as such, the Company cannot guarantee that future leases
will continue to be signed for rents that are equal to or higher than current amounts.
Ground-Leased Properties. The Company has interests in 44 consolidated shopping center properties that are subject to long-
term ground leases where a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to the Company to construct and/or operate a shopping
center. The Company pays rent for the use of the land and generally is responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the
building and improvements. At the end of these long-term leases, unless extended, the land together with all improvements reverts to
the landowner.
More specific information with respect to each of the Company's property interests is set forth in Exhibit 99.1, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
The Company is not presently involved in any litigation nor, to its knowledge, is any litigation threatened against the Company or
its subsidiaries that, in management's opinion, would result in any material adverse effect on the Company's ownership, management
or operation of its properties taken as a whole, or which is not covered by the Company's liability insurance.
On January 28, 2013, the Company received a subpoena from the Enforcement Division of the SEC in connection with an
investigation, In the Matter of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (FW-3678), that the SEC Staff is currently conducting with respect to possible
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company has cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with the SEC and the
US. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which is conducting a parallel investigation. At this point, we are unable to predict the duration,
scope or result of the SEC or DOJ investigations.
