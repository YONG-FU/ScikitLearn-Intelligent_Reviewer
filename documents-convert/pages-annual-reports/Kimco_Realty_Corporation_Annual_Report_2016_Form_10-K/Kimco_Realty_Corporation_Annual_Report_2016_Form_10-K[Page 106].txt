KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, continued
At December 31, 2016, the Company had a net $6.3 million of unrealized cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment
(“CTA”) gains relating to its foreign entity investments in Canada. CTA results from currency ﬂuctuations between local
currency and the US. dollar during the period in which the Company held its investment. CTA amounts are subject to future
changes resulting from ongoing ﬂuctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates. Under US. GAAP, the Company
is required to release CTA balances into earnings when the Company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign
entity. During 2015, the Company began selling properties within its Canadian portfolio and as such, the Company may, in the
near term, substantially liquidate its remaining investment in Canada, which will require the then unrealized gain on foreign
currency translation to be recognized as a benefit to earnings.

25. Captive Insurance Company;
In October 2007, the Company formed a wholly—owned captive insurance company, KIC, which provides general liability
insurance coverage for all losses below the deductible under the Company’s third-party liability insurance policy. The Company
created KIC as part of its overall risk management program and to stabilize its insurance costs, manage exposure and recoup
expenses through the functions of the captive program. The Company capitalized KIC in accordance with the applicable
regulatory requirements. KIC established annual premiums based on projections derived from the past loss experience of the
Company’s properties. KIC has engaged an independent third party to perform an actuarial estimate of future projected claims,
related deductibles and projected expenses necessary to fund associated risk management programs. Premiums paid to KIC may
be adjusted based on this estimate. Like premiums paid to third-party insurance companies, premiums paid to KIC may be
reimbursed by tenants pursuant to specific lease terms.
KIC assumes occurrence basis general liability coverage for the Company and its affiliates under the terms of a reinsurance
agreement entered into by KIC and the reinsurance provider.
From October 1, 2007 through October 1, 2017, KIC assumes 100% of the first $250,000 per occurrence risk layer. This coverage
is subject to annual aggregates ranging between $7.8 million and $11.5 million per policy year. The annual aggregate is adjustable
based on the amount of audited square footage of the insureds’ locations and can be adjusted for subsequent program years.
Defense costs erode the stated policy limits. KIC is required to pay the reinsurance provider for unallocated loss adjustment
expenses an amount ranging between 9.5% and 12.2% of incurred losses for the policy periods ending September 30, 2008
through September 30, 2017. These amounts do not erode the Company’s per occurrence or aggregate limits.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company maintained a letter of credit in the amount of $23.0 million issued in favor of
the reinsurance provider to provide security for the Company’s obligations under its agreement with the reinsurance provider. The
letter of credit maintained as of December 31, 2016, has an expiration date of February 15, 2018, with automatic renewals for one
year.
