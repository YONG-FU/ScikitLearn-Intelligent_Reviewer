The decrease in reported EMEA revenue from services was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. The increase in CC revenue from services was due to a 7% increase in hours, partially offset by a 3% decrease
in average bill rates on a CC basis, combined with a decrease in stafﬁng fee-based income. The increase in hours was due
primarily to higher hours volume in Portugal and France, partially offset by a reduction of hours volume with larger customers
in Switzerland. The decrease in average bill rates was due primarily to increasing revenue in Portugal, a country with lower
average bill rates. EMEA represented 17% of total Company revenue in 2015 and 20% in 2014. The 53rd week added
approximately 1% to 2015 reported and CC revenue in EMEA.
The EMEA gross proﬁt rate decreased primarily due to a decline in the temporary gross proﬁt rate and a decline in stafﬁng fee-
based income. Stafﬁng fee-based income declined in both Commercial and PT, primarily in Russia, partially offset by
increases in stafﬁng fee-based income in some other countries. Economic conditions in Russia continue to be challenging,
resulting in the decline in stafﬁng fee-based income. The decrease in the temporary gross proﬁt rate was primarily driven by
unfavorable country mix, as described above.
SG&A expenses decreased due to cost saving actions taken in 2015, primarily in Switzerland, Norway and the UK, and the
exit of stafﬁng operations in Sweden. Restructuring costs recorded in 2014 reﬂect costs incurred for exiting the stafﬁng
business in Sweden.
