Results of Operations
Financial Condition
Historically, we have ﬁnanced our operations through cash generated by operating activities and access to credit markets. Our
working capital requirements are primarily generated from temporary employee payroll and customer accounts receivable.
Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase
substantially in periods of growth. Conversely, when economic activity slows, working capital requirements may substantially
decrease. As highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash ﬂows, our liquidity and available capital resources are
impacted by four key components: cash and equivalents, operating activities, investing activities and ﬁnancing activities.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and equivalents totaled $29.6 million at year-end 2016, compared to $42.2 million at year-end 2015. As further described
below, during 2016, we generated $37.4 million of cash from operating activities, generated $10.3 million of cash from
investing activities and used $66.9 million in cash for ﬁnancing activities. The decrease in balance of cash and equivalents
from 2015 to 2016 is due to effective cash management.
Operating Activities
In 2016, we generated $37.4 million of net cash from operating activities, as compared to generating $23.5 million in 2015 and
using $70.0 million in 2014. The change from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to lower growth in trade accounts receivable.
The change from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to lower growth in trade accounts receivable and improving net earnings.
Trade accounts receivable totaled $1.1 billion at both year-end 2016 and 2015. Global DSO for the fourth quarter were 53 days
for 2016, compared to 54 days for 2015.
Our working capital position was $443.5 million at year-end 2016, an increase of $32.2 million from year-end 2015. The
current ratio (total current assets divided by total current liabilities) was 1.6 at year-end 2016 and 1.5 at year-end 2015.
Investing Activities
In 2016, we generated $10.3 million of net cash from investing activities, compared to using $17.6 million in 2015 and $27.2
million in 2014. Included in cash from investing activities is $23.3 million of net cash representing the cash received less the
cash deconsolidated relating to the TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc joint venture transaction. Capital expenditures, which totaled $12.7
million in 2016, $16.9 million in 2015 and $21.7 million in 2014, were primarily related to the Company’s technology
programs. The decrease reﬂects the Company’s increased use of externally hosted technology platforms.
Investment in TS Kelly equity afﬁliate represents cash contributions in 2015 and 2014 to TS Kelly Workforce Solutions, our
equity afﬁliate in which we had a 49% ownership interest. In 2014, the amount included $4.8 million for the acquisition of a
China-based stafﬁng company by TS Kelly.
Financing Activities
In 2016, we used $66.9 million of cash for ﬁnancing activities, as compared to using $42.2 million in 2015 and generating
$56.6 million in 2014. Changes in net cash from ﬁnancing activities are primarily related to short-term borrowing activities.
We had no debt at year-end 2016 compared to $55.5 million at year-end 2015. Debt-to-total capital is a common ratio to
measure the relative capital structure and leverage of the Company. Our ratio of debt-to-total capital (total debt reported on the
balance sheet divided by total debt plus stockholders’ equity) was 0.0% at year-end 2016 and 5.8% at year-end 2015.
In 2016 and 2015, the net change in short-term borrowings was primarily due to payments on our US. securitization facility. In
2014, the net change in short-term borrowings was primarily due to $60.0 million in additional borrowings on our
securitization facility, used to fund our everyday operations, and $3.5 million in borrowings under the revolving line of credit in
Brazil.
Dividends paid per common share were $0.275 in 2016 and $0.20 in 2015 and 2014. Payments of dividends are restricted by
the ﬁnancial covenants contained in our debt facilities. Details of this restriction are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes
to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
