Revenue from services in the OCG segment increased during 2015 due primarily to growth in the BPO and CWO practice
areas. Revenue in BPO grew by 25% year over year and CWO, which includes PPO, grew by 17% year over year. The
revenue growth in BPO and CWO was due to the expansion of programs with existing customers and, to a lesser extent, new
customers. OCG revenue represented 12% of total Company revenue in 2015 and 11% in 2014. The 53rd week added
approximately 1% to 2015 reported and CC revenue in OCG.
The OCG gross proﬁt rate decrease is due to practice area mix, as our lower margin BPO and PPO businesses experienced
strong volume growth. While both BPO and FPO experienced margin increases in addition to strong revenue growth, it was
insufficient to offset the margin decline and volume contraction in the higher margin RPO business. RPO experienced volume
and margin decline mainly due to customers in the oil and gas industry.
The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily a result of costs associated with increased volume with existing customers and
implementation costs of new customers mainly in our CWO and KellyConnect practice areas.
