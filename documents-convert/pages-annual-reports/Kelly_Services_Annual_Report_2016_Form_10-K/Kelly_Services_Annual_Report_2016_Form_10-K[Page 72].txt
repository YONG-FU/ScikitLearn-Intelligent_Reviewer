Restricted Stock
Restricted stock, which typically vests over 4 years, is issued to certain key employees and is subject to forfeiture until the end
of an established restriction period. The Company utilizes the market price of its Class A stock on the date of grant as the fair
value of restricted stock and expenses the fair value on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
A summary of the status of nonvested restricted stock under the EIP as of year-end 2016 and changes during this period is
presented as follows:
Weighted
Average

As of year-end 2016, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock totaled $8.5 million. The weighted
average period over which this cost is expected to be recognized is approximately 1.5 years. The weighted average grant date
fair value per share of restricted stock granted during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $17.08, $15.85 and $15.63, respectively. The
total fair value of restricted stock, which vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $6.4 million, $5.4 million and $7.1 million,
respectively.
Performance Shares
During 2016 and 2015, the Company granted performance awards associated with the Company’s Class A stock to certain
senior ofﬁcers. The payment of performance shares, which will be satisﬁed with the issuance of shares out of treasury stock, is
contingent upon the achievement of speciﬁc performance goals over a stated period of time.
2016 Grant
For the 2016 performance share grant (“2016 grant”), the total target number of performance shares granted is 331,500, and the
maximum number of performance shares that may be earned is 663,000, which assumes 200% of the target shares originally
granted. Target shares of 248,625 may be earned upon the achievement of three ﬁnancial goals (“ﬁnancial measure
performance shares”) and target shares of 82,875 may be earned based on the Company’s total shareholder return relative to the
S&P SmallCap 600 Index (“TSR performance shares”). No dividends are paid on these performance shares.
The ﬁnancial measure performance shares, which have a weighted average grant date fair value of $15.85, have a three-year
performance period through December 31, 2018. These shares will cliff-vest after approval by the Compensation Committee,
which will be no later than March 15, 2019, if not forfeited by the recipient. For each of the three ﬁnancial measures, there are
annual goals set in February of each year, with the total award payout based on a cumulative average of the 2016, 2017 and
2018 goals. Accordingly, the Company remeasures the fair value of the 2016 ﬁnancial measure performance shares each
reporting period until the 2018 goals are set, after which the fair value will be ﬁxed for the remaining performance period. As
of year-end 2016, the current fair value for ﬁnancial measure performance shares was $22.04. The total nonvested shares at
maximum level (200%) related to ﬁnancial measure performance awards at year-end 2016 is 497,250.
The TSR performance shares have a three-year performance period through December, 31, 2018 and have an estimated fair
value of $19.73, which was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating assumptions for inputs of expected
stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. If earned, these shares will be awarded and fully vest after
approval by the Compensation Committee, which will be no later than March 15 , 2019, if not forfeited by the recipient. The
total nonvested shares at maximum level (200%) related to TSR performance awards at year-end 2016 is 165,750.
