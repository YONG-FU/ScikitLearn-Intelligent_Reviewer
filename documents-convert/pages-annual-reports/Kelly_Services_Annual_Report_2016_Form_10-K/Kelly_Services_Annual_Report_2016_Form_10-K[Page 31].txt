The decrease in reported Americas revenue from services was due to a 3% decrease in hours volume, partially offset by a 1%
increase in average bill rates (a 2% increase on a CC basis). The decrease in hours volume is due, in part, to the 53rd week in
2015, which added approximately 1% to 2015 revenue in Americas. The remainder of the decrease reﬂected decreased volume
in accounts in our centrally delivered service model. The increase in average bill rates was primarily due to wage inﬂation and
the resulting impact on the bill rate. Americas represented 66% of total Company revenue in 2016 and 65% in 2015.
Revenue in our Commercial segment decreased 2% on a reported basis and decreased 1% on a CC basis in comparison to the
prior year. The decrease in CC revenue in Commercial was primarily due to the 5 3rd week in 2015. Additionally, we
experienced lower demand from customers in our centrally delivered service model. These decreases were partially offset by
increases in our educational stafﬁng business from new customer wins, as well as increases in our light industrial business in
our branch-based model.
In the PT segment, reported and CC revenue decreased 3% in comparison to the prior year. PT revenue was down 4% in
accounts serviced by our centralized delivery model due to decreased customer demand and the continued shift in buying
behavior of those customers from single-sourced arrangements to a more competitively sourced model. PT revenue was up 2%
in accounts serviced by our branch-based delivery model due primarily to increases in new customer wins and customer
projects throughout the year.
The increase in the gross proﬁt rate was primarily due to improved management of our payroll taxes, partially offset by higher
workers’ compensation and employee beneﬁt costs, and the negative impact of customer mix.
Total SG&A expenses increased 0.1% on a reported basis and 0.6% on a CC basis. Included in SG&A expenses are
restructuring charges of $2.2 million. These charges represent severance costs related to headcount reductions as well as lease
buyout costs due to branch consolidations.
