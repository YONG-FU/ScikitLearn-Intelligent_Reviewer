The reported change in total APAC revenue from services was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. The increase in revenue from services on a CC basis was primarily due to a 13% increase in hours worked,
primarily in India. Average bill rates declined 11% on a reported basis and increased 1% on a CC basis. APAC revenue
represented 7% of total Company revenue in both 2015 and 2014. The 53rd week in ﬁscal 2015 did not have a material impact
on reported and CC revenue in APAC.
The gross proﬁt rate declined due to decreases in the stafﬁng fee-based income and the temporary gross proﬁt rate, partially
offset by higher-than—expected wage credits in Singapore. The reduction in the temporary gross proﬁt rate was due to an
increased proportion of large accounts with lower margins. Stafﬁng fee-based income decreased due mainly to a weaker hiring
climate in Australia and Singapore. Singapore wage credits include additional prior year credits received in the current year,
and totaled $5.2 million in 2015 and $2.2 million in 2014.
The decrease in SG&A expenses excluding restructuring charges was due to continuing productivity improvements primarily
achieved by consolidating the Australia and New Zealand operations in the prior year. Restructuring charges in 2014 relate to
costs for exiting branches in Australia and consolidating back ofﬁce functions in Australia and New Zealand.
