Purchase obligations above represent unconditional commitments relating primarily to online tools and voice and data
communications services which we expect to utilize generally within the next two ﬁscal years, in the ordinary course of
business. We have no material, unrecorded commitments, losses, contingencies or guarantees associated with any related
parties or unconsolidated entities.
Liquidity
We expect to meet our ongoing short-term and long-term cash requirements principally through cash generated from
operations, available cash and equivalents, securitization of customer receivables and committed unused credit facilities.
Additional funding sources could include public or private bonds, asset-based lending, additional bank facilities, issuance of
equity or other sources.
We utilize intercompany loans, dividends, capital contributions and redemptions to effectively manage our cash on a global
basis. We periodically review our foreign subsidiaries’ cash balances and projected cash needs. As part of those reviews, we
may identify cash that we feel should be repatriated to optimize the Company’s overall capital structure. As of the 2016 year
end, these reviews have not resulted in any specific plans to repatriate a majority of our international cash balances. We expect
much of our international cash will be needed to fund working capital growth in our local operations. The majority of our
international cash is concentrated in a cash pooling arrangement (the “Cash Pool”) and is available to fund general corporate
needs internationally. The Cash Pool is a set of cash accounts maintained with a single bank that must, as a whole, maintain at
least a zero balance; individual accounts may be positive or negative. This allows countries with excess cash to invest and
countries with cash needs to utilize the excess cash.
We manage our cash and debt very closely to optimize our capital structure. As our cash balances build, we tend to pay down
debt as appropriate. Conversely, when working capital needs grow, we tend to use corporate cash and cash available in the
Cash Pool first, and then access our borrowing facilities.
At year-end 2016, we had $150.0 million of available capacity on our $150.0 million revolving credit facility and $149.6
million of available capacity on our $200.0 million securitization facility. The securitization facility had no short-term
borrowings and $50.4 million of standby letters of credit related to workers’ compensation. Together, the revolving credit and
securitization facilities provide the Company with committed funding capacity that may be used for general corporate purposes.
While we believe these facilities will cover our working capital needs over the short term, if economic conditions or operating
results change significantly, we may need to seek additional sources of funds. Throughout 2016 and as of the 2016 year end, we
met the debt covenants related to our revolving credit facility and securitization facility.
At year-end 2016, we also had additional unsecured, uncommitted short-term credit facilities totaling $8.6 million, under which
we had no borrowings. Details of our debt facilities as of the 2016 year end are contained in the Debt footnote in the notes to
our consolidated financial statements.
