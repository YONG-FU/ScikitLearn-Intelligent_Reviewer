The change in reported EMEA revenue from services was due to a 3% decrease in average bill rates (ﬂat on a CC basis),
partially offset by a 2% increase in hours volume. The increase in hours volume was primarily due to increased customer
demand in Portugal. EMEA represented 18% of total Company revenue in 2016 and 17% in 2015. The 53rd week in 2015
added approximately 1% to 2015 revenue in EMEA.
The EMEA gross proﬁt rate decrease was mainly driven by unfavorable customer mix in Switzerland. Stafﬁng fee-based
income increased primarily in Western Europe, partially offset by a decrease in the UK.
Total SG&A expenses decreased 3.3% on a reported basis and 0.7% on a CC basis, primarily due to effective cost control in
headquarters expenses across the region. Included in SG&A expenses are restructuring charges of $1.2 million, which reﬂect a
repositioning of the operating model to pursue growth in stafﬁng fee-based income and specialized temporary stafﬁng business
in Italy.
