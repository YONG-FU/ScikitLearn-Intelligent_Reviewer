KELLY SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
8. Retirement Benefits
The Company provides a qualiﬁed deﬁned contribution plan covering substantially all U.S.-based full-time employees, except
ofﬁcers and certain other employees. The plan offers a savings feature with Company matching contributions. Assets of this
plan are held by an independent trustee for the sole beneﬁt of participating employees.
A nonqualiﬁed plan is provided for ofﬁcers and certain other employees. This plan includes provisions for salary deferrals and
Company matching contributions.
Effective January 1, 2015, the Board of Directors approved amendments to the qualiﬁed and unqualiﬁed deﬁned contribution
plans to increase Company matching contributions and eliminate the discretionary contributions.
In addition to the plans above, the Company also provides a qualiﬁed plan and a nonqualiﬁed plan to certain U.S.-based
temporary employees.
The liability for the nonqualiﬁed plans was $166.7 million and $150.3 million as of year-end 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
is included in current accrued payroll and related taxes and noncurrent accrued retirement beneﬁts. The cost of participants’
earnings or loss on this liability, which were included in SG&A expenses, were earnings of $10.5 million in 2016, loss of $1.6
million in 2015 and earnings of $7.6 million in 2014. In connection with the administration of these plans, the Company has
purchased company-owned variable universal life insurance policies insuring the lives of certain current and former ofﬁcers
and key employees. The cash surrender value of these policies, which is based primarily on investments in mutual ﬁnds and
can only be used for payment of the Company’s obligations related to the nonqualiﬁed deferred compensation plan noted
above, was $165.0 million and $148.2 million at year-end 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash surrender value of these
insurance policies is included in other assets. Tax-free earnings on these assets, which were included in SG&A expenses, were
$9.7 million in 2016, $0.3 million in 2015 and $7.3 million in 2014.
The net expense for retirement beneﬁts for the qualiﬁed and nonqualiﬁed plans, including Company matching and
discretionary contributions for full-time employees, totaled $9.0 million in 2016, $5.7 million in 2015 and $6.1 million in 2014.
The expense related to retirement plan contributions for temporary employees, which is included in cost of services, is
reimbursed by our customers.
In addition, the Company also has several deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans in locations outside of the United States. The total
projected beneﬁt obligation, assets and unfunded liability for these plans as of year-end 2016 were $11.6 million, $7.6 million
and $4.0 million, respectively. The total projected beneﬁt obligation, assets and unﬁlnded liability for these plans as of year-
end 2015 were $11.5 million, $7.3 million and $4.2 million, respectively. Total pension expense for these plans was $0.4
million, $0.3 million and $0.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Pension contributions and the amount of
accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized in 2017 are not signiﬁcant.
9. Stockholders’ Equity
Common Stock
The authorized capital stock of the Company is 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Class B
common stock. Class A shares have no voting rights and are not convertible. Class B shares have voting rights and are
convertible by the holder into Class A shares on a share-for—share basis at any time. Both classes of stock have identical rights
in the event of liquidation.
Class A shares and Class B shares are both entitled to receive dividends, subject to the limitation that no cash dividend on the
Class B shares may be declared unless the Board of Directors declares an equal or larger cash dividend on the Class A shares.
As a result, a cash dividend may be declared on the Class A shares without declaring a cash dividend on the Class B shares.
The Company made dividend payments totaling $10.7 million in 2016, $7.7 million in 2015 and $7.6 million in 2014.
