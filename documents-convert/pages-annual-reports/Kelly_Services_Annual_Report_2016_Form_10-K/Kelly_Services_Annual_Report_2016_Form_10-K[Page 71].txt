Potentially dilutive shares outstanding are primarily related to performance shares for 2016 and 2015. Stock options excluded
from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to their anti-dilutive effect for 2016 and 2015 were not signiﬁcant.
Stock options representing 0.1 million shares for 2014 were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share due to
their anti-dilutive effect.
We have presented earnings per share for our two classes of common stock on a combined basis. This presentation is
consistent with the earnings per share computations that result for each class of common stock utilizing the two-class method as
described in ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share”. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula which determines
earnings per share for each class of common stock according to the dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation
rights in the undistributed earnings.
In applying the two class method, we have determined that the undistributed earnings should be allocated to each class on a pro
rata basis after consideration of all of the participation rights of the Class B shares (including voting and conversion rights) and
our history of paying dividends equally to each class of common stock on a per share basis.
The Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation allows the Board of Directors to declare a cash dividend to Class A shares
without declaring equal dividends to the Class B shares. Class B shares’ voting and conversion rights, however, effectively
allow the Class B shares to participate in dividends equally with Class A shares on a per share basis.
The Class B shares are the only shares with voting rights. The Class B shareholders are therefore able to exercise voting
control with respect to all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of or removal of directors. The Board
of Directors has historically declared and the Company historically has paid equal per share dividends on both the Class A and
Class B shares. Each class has participated equally in all dividends declared since 1987.
In addition, Class B shares are convertible, at the option of the holder, into Class A shares on a one-for—one basis. As a result,
Class B shares can participate equally in any dividends declared on the Class A shares by exercising their conversion rights.
11. Stock-Based Compensation
Under the Equity Incentive Plan, amended and restated February 12, 2015 and approved by the stockholders of the Company
on May 6, 2015 (the “EIP”), the Company may grant stock options (both incentive and nonqualified), stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and performance awards to key employees associated with the Company’s Class A stock. The EIP provides that
the maximum number of shares available for grants is 15 percent of the outstanding Class A stock, adjusted for EIP activity
over the preceding five years. Shares available for future grants at year-end 2016 under the EIP were 2,444,136. The Company
issues shares out of treasury stock to satisfy stock-based awards. The Company presently has no intent to repurchase additional
shares for the purpose of satisfying stock-based awards.
The Company recognized stock-based compensation cost of $10.2 million in 2016, $7.9 million in 2015 and $7.6 million in
2014, as well as related tax benefits of $3.9 million in 2016, $3.0 million in 2015 and $2.9 million in 2014.
