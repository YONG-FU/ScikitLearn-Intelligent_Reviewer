The increase in reported Americas revenue from services was due to a 2% increase in hours worked, offset by a 2% decrease in
average bill rates. Average bill rates were ﬂat on a constant currency basis. The increase in hours worked was due to increases
in our local branch network customer activity. Americas represented 65% of total Company revenue in 2015 and 64% in 2014.
The 53rd week added approximately 1% to 2015 reported and CC revenue in Americas.
Revenue in our Commercial segment was ﬂat and up 2% on a CC basis in comparison to the prior year. The increase in CC
revenue in Commercial was primarily due to increases in our educational stafﬁng business, as a result of new customer wins,
and in our light industrial product, due to increased demand at existing customer locations, coupled with additional new
customer wins. Light industrial business is up primarily in accounts serviced through our branch-based delivery model.
Volume in our large accounts using our centralized delivery model is down as a result of our exit from certain large accounts
due to pricing discipline and the reduced revenue from our natural resources customers related to lower oil prices.
In the PT segment, reported and CC revenue was up 2% in comparison to the prior year. Increases in accounts serviced through
our branch delivery model more than offset the decreases in accounts for customers services through the centralized delivery
model. Revenue has increased in our science and ﬁnance products, while revenue in our engineering product decreased
primarily due to the completion of certain projects. IT revenue, speciﬁcally in the centralized delivery model, is down mainly
due to customers moving from a traditional stafﬁng model to an outsourced model delivered by our OCG business. On an
overall basis, we have seen a shift in the buying behavior of our large centrally delivered customers from single-sourced
arrangements to a more competitively sourced model, which puts pressure on revenue in accounts serviced in our centralized
delivery model.
The increase in the gross proﬁt rate was primarily due to improved management of our payroll taxes and employee beneﬁt
costs, coupled with improved pricing in our US. branch network and overall customer mix.
The increase in SG&A expenses is attributable to the increased incentive costs and compensation in our local branch network,
partially offset by the impact of the Plan we implemented in the fourth quarter of last year.
