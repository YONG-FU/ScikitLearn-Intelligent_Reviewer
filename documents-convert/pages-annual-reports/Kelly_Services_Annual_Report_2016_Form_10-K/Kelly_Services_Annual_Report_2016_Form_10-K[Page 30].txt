Total Company results of operations for 2016 were impacted by the transfer of APAC stafﬁng and certain APAC OCG
businesses to the TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc joint venture in the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, separate APAC results for 2016
and 2015 are not presented in the following discussions due to the lack of comparability between the periods.
Total Company revenue from services for 2016 was down 4.4% in comparison to the prior year on a reported basis, and down
3.2% on a CC basis due, in part, to the transfer of the APAC operations and as more fully described in the following
discussions. See Segment Disclosures footnote in the notes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the impact of this
transfer on year-over-year segment results. In addition, the 2015 ﬁscal year included a 53rd week. This ﬁscal leap year occurs
every ﬁve or six years and is necessary to align the ﬁscal and calendar periods. The 53rd week added approximately 1% to
2015 revenue.
The gross proﬁt rate increased 50 basis points year over year. The transfer of the APAC businesses, which had lower gross
proﬁt rates than the Company average, accounted for 10 basis points of the increase. Additionally, as more fully described in
the following discussions, increases in the Americas and OCG gross proﬁt rates were partially offset by a decline in the gross
proﬁt rate in the EMEA region.
Total SG&A expenses decreased 1.2% on a reported basis and 0.3% on a CC basis. Included in SG&A expenses are
restructuring charges of $3.4 million, which relate to actions taken in the Americas and EMEA regions to manage operating
expenses and prepare the businesses for future growth. The year-over—year decrease in SG&A expenses reﬂects the transfer of
APAC operations to the joint venture, decreases in expense in our stafﬁng operations and savings from reductions in
performance-based compensation expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in OCG SG&A expenses due
to current and expected growth in that segment.
Income tax expense for 2016 was $30.0 million, compared to $8.7 million for 2015. Our tax expense is affected by recurring
items, such as the amount of pretax income and its mix by jurisdiction, U.S. work opportunity credits and the change in cash
surrender value of non-taxable investments in life insurance policies. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any
given period but are not consistent from period to period, such as tax law changes, or changes in judgment regarding the
realizability of deferred tax assets. The increase in income tax expense from the prior year is primarily due to tax expense of
$23.5 million from the gain on the investment in TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc, the impact of which is partially offset by a $2.1 million
beneﬁt from the release of valuation allowances in Italy.
Diluted earnings per share for 2016 were $3.08, as compared to $1.39 for 2015.
