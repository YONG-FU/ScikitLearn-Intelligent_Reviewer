staffing fee-based income and specialized temporary stafﬁng business.

4. Investment in TS Kelly Asia Paciﬁc
On July 4, 2016, the Company and Temp Holdings, a leading integrated human resources company in Japan, completed a
transaction to form a new joint venture, TS Kelly Asia Pacific. The Company transferred its Asia Pacific staffing operations
and certain APAC OCG businesses in exchange for a 49% ownership interest in TS Kelly Asia Pacific and $36.5 million in
cash received at closing. The Company subsequently deconsolidated the contributed APAC staffing and OCG operations and
recorded a $104.2 million investment in equity affiliate on the consolidated balance sheet, which represented the fair value of
the Company’s ownership interest in TS Kelly Asia Pacific as of July 4, 2016. As part of this transaction, in the third quarter of
2016, the Company deconsolidated the goodwill related to the contributed entities in our APAC PT and OCG segments
amounting to $1.9 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company received a $4.5 million post-close cash true-up
adjustment from Temp Holdings.
In the third quarter of 201 6, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $87.2 million on the investment in TS Kelly Asia Pacific in
the consolidated statement of earnings, which represents the fair value of the Company’s retained investment in TS Kelly Asia

$23.5 million on this gain result primarily from recording deferred income taxes on outside basis differences. The fair value of
the Company’s contributed operations was determined using both an income-based and market-based approach. The income
approach utilized a discounted cash ﬂow analysis which included significant assumptions about the timing of future cash ﬂows,
growth rates and discount rates commensurate with the underlying risks of the investment. The market approach entailed
