The Company has established a valuation allowance for loss carryforwards and future deductible items in certain foreign
jurisdictions, and for US. foreign tax credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 740, which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a
valuation allowance. The Company’s recent losses in these foreign jurisdictions, and its recent lack of adequate US. foreign
source income to fully utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards, represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation
allowance under ASC 740. The Company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufﬁcient positive evidence exists to
support realization of the foreign deferred tax assets.
Provision has not been made for US or additional foreign income taxes on an estimated $110.5 million of undistributed
earnings which are permanently reinvested. If these earnings were to be repatriated, the Company would be subject to US.
income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, adjusted for foreign tax credits. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized
deferred income tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is not practicable due to the complexities associated with
this hypothetical calculation.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts is as follows:

If the $1.4 million in 2016, $1.7 million in 2015 and $2.4 million in 2014 of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, they
would have a favorable effect of $1.0 million in 2016, $1.1 million in 2015 and $1.5 million in 2014 on income tax expense.
The Company recognizes both interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision. Interest and penalties expense in 2016
was not significant. The Company recognized a benefit of $0.2 million in 2015 and expense of $0.1 million in 2014 for interest
and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $0.2 million at year-end 2016 and $0.2 million at year-end 2015.
The Company files income tax returns in the US and in various states and foreign countries. The tax periods open to
examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject include the US for ﬁscal years 2013 through
2016, Canada for fiscal years 2009 through 2016, France for ﬁscal years 2014 through 2016, Mexico for fiscal years 2011
through 2016, Portugal for fiscal years 2013 through 2016, and Switzerland for ﬁscal years 2007 through 2016.
The Company and its subsidiaries have various income tax returns in the process of examination. The unrecognized tax benefit
and related interest and penalty balances include approximately $0.4 million for 2016, related to tax positions which are
reasonably possible to change within the next twelve months due to income tax audits, settlements and statute expirations.
