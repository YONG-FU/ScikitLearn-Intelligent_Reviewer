Total Company revenue from services for 2015 was down 0.8% in comparison to 2014, primarily as a result of currency
ﬂuctuations. During 2015, the U.S. dollar strengthened against certain currencies, primarily the Euro, Russian ruble and the
Australian dollar, compared to 2014. On a CC basis, total Company revenue increased 4.7% year over year, as more ﬁllly
described in the following discussions. The 2015 ﬁscal year included a 53rd week. This ﬁscal leap year occurs every ﬁve or
six years and is necessary to align the ﬁscal and calendar periods. The 53rd week added approximately 1% to 2015 reported
and CC revenue.
The gross proﬁt rate increased 40 basis points on a year-over—year basis. As more ﬁllly described in the following discussions,
an increase in the Americas region gross proﬁt rate was partially offset by declines in the gross proﬁt rate in EMEA, APAC and
OCG.
SG&A expenses excluding restructuring costs decreased 2.4% year over year, reﬂecting the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. On a CC basis, SG&A expenses increased 2.2% due to higher expenses in our U.S. branch-based and
OCG businesses and higher corporate litigation-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by the cost savings of
our management simpliﬁcation restructuring plan (“Plan”), and continued cost management efforts in EMEA and APAC.
Restructuring charges in 2014 include $9.9 million related to the Plan, $0.8 million of costs incurred for exiting the stafﬁng
business in Sweden and $1.3 million related to closing branches in Australia and consolidating back ofﬁce functions in
Australia and New Zealand.
Income tax expense for 2015 was $8.7 million, compared to a beneﬁt of $7.1 million for 2014. Our tax expense is affected by
recurring items, such as the amount of pretax income and its mix by jurisdiction, U.S. work opportunity credits, and the change
in cash surrender value of non-taxable investments in life insurance policies. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur
in any given year but are not consistent from year to year, such as tax law changes, or changes in judgment regarding the
realizability of deferred tax assets. The 2015 year-over-year increase in income tax expense is primarily due to increased pretax
income. The work opportunity credit program was extended through 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and retroactively
applied to 2015, providing stability for this item.
Diluted earnings per share for 2015 were $1.39, as compared to $0.61 for 2014.
