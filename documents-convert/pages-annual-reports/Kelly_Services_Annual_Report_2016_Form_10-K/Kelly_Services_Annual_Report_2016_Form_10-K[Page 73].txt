NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
2015 Grant
For the 2015 performance share grant (“2015 grant”), the total target number of performance shares granted is 375,000, and the
maximum number of performance shares that may be earned is 750,000, which assumes 200% of the target shares originally
granted. Target shares of 250,000 may be earned upon the achievement of two financial goals (“financial measure performance
shares”) and target shares of 125,000 may be earned based on the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the
S&P SmallCap 600 Index (“TSR performance shares”). No dividends are paid on these performance shares.
The 2015 financial measure performance shares, which have a weighted average grant date fair value of $16.31, had a one-year
performance measure through ﬁscal 2015 and will vest after the completion of an additional two-year service period. Based
upon the level of achievement of speciﬁc ﬁnancial performance goals for the 2015 grant, participants had the ability to receive
up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted. On February 17, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved
the actual performance achievement of the ﬁnancial measure performance shares for the 2015 grant. Actual performance
resulted in participants achieving 115% of target, or 287,896 shares for the ﬁnancial measure performance awards on a
combined basis. These shares will cliff-vest after the approval of the Compensation Committee, which will be no later than
March 15, 2018, if not forfeited by the recipient. The total nonvested shares related to 2015 ﬁnancial measure performance
awards at year-end 2016 is 287,896.
The 2015 TSR performance shares have a three-year performance measure with vesting at the end of the performance period.
These shares have an estimated fair value of $16.01, which was computed using a Monte Carlo simulation model incorporating
assumptions for inputs of expected stock price volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. If earned, these shares will
be awarded and fully vest after the approval of the Compensation Committee, which will be no later than March 15, 2018, if
not forfeited by the recipient. The total nonvested shares at maximum level (200%) related to TSR performance awards at year-
end 2016 is 250,000.
As of year-end 2016, unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested financial measure performance shares and TSR
performance shares totaled $2.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The weighted average period over which the costs are
expected to be recognized is approximately 1.3 years for financial measure performance shares and 1.6 years for TSR
performance shares.
Stock Options
Under the terms of the EIP, stock options may not be granted at prices less than the fair value of the Company’s Class A stock
on the date of grant, nor for a term exceeding 10 years, and typically vest over 3 years. The Company expenses the fair value
of stock option grants on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. No stock options were granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
A summary of the status of stock option grants under the EIP as of year-end 2016 and changes during this period is presented as
