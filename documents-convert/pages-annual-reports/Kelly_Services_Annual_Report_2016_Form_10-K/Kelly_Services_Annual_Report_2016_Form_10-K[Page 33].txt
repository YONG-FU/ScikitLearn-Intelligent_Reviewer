Revenue from services in the OCG segment increased during 2016 due primarily to growth in the BPO and RFC practice areas.
Revenue in BPO grew by 9% year over year and RPO grew 4% year over year. This revenue growth was due primarily to the
expansion of programs with existing customers and, to a lesser extent, new customers. OCG revenue represented 13% of total
Company revenue in 2016 and 12% in 2015. The 53rd week in 2015 added approximately 1% to 2015 revenue in OCG.
The OCG gross proﬁt rate increased primarily due to an increased gross proﬁt rates in BPO, RFC and CWO as a result of
customer and practice area mix.
The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily a result of costs related to additional sales resources, costs associated with
increased volume with existing customers and implementation of new business, including salaries and performance-based
compensation, and bad debt expense. The bad debt expense was primarily related to certain aged accounts receivable at a
subsidiary in Germany.
