Our stock price may be subject to signiﬁcant volatility and could suffer a decline in value.
The market price of our common stock may be subject to signiﬁcant volatility. We believe that many factors, including several
which are beyond our control, have a signiﬁcant effect on the market price of our common stock. These include:
0 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;
° announcements of new services by us or our competitors;
0 announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions;
0 changes in ﬁnancial estimates by securities analysts;
0 changes in general economic conditions;
0 actual or anticipated changes in laws and government regulations;
° commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;
0 any major change in our board or management;
0 changes in industry trends or conditions; and
0 sales of signiﬁcant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the market.
In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market in particular, have experienced signiﬁcant price and
volume ﬂuctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. These
broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating
performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market
price of a company’s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and
the diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Further, our operating results may be below the expectations of
securities analysts or investors. In such event, the price of our common stock may decline.
