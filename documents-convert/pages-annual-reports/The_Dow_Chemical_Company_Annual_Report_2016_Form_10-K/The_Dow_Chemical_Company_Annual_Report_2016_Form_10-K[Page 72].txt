improved by more than 40 percent since 1990. As part of the Company's 2025 Sustainability Goals, Dow will maintain GHG
emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all GHGs.
Environmental Remediation
Dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory
requirements. The nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination. The accounting
policies adopted to properly reﬂect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. To assess the impact on the financial statements, environmental experts review currently available facts
to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to
unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and the ability
to apply remediation technologies. These liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional
technical or legal information becomes available. Dow had an accrued liability of $758 million at December 31, 2016, related
to the remediation of current or former Dow-owned sites. At December 31, 2015, the liability related to remediation was
$596 million.
In addition to current and former Dow-owned sites, under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as "Superfund Law"), Dow is liable
for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where Dow allegedly disposed of, or arranged for the treatment or disposal of,
hazardous substances. Because Superfund Law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site, Dow has evaluated
its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties
(“PRPs”) at each site, the estimated apportionment of costs among all PRPs, and the financial ability and commitment of each
to pay its expected share. The Company’s remaining liability for the remediation of Superfund sites was $151 million at
December 31, 2016 ($74 million at December 31, 2015). The Company has not recorded any third-party recovery related to
these sites as a receivable.

(1) Dow-owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by Dow. In the United States, remediation
obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or analogous state law. At
December 31, 2016, 38 of these sites (41 sites at December 31, 2015) were formerly owned by
Dowell Schlumberger, Inc., a group of companies in which the Company previously owned a
50 percent interest. Dow sold its interest in Dowell Schlumberger in 1992.
(2) Superfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by Dow, where remediation obligations are
imposed by Superfund Law.
Additional information is provided below for the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland oﬁ-site
locations (collectively, the "Midland sites"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for which the
Company has the largest potential environmental liabilities.
In the early days of operations at the Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on—site, resulting in soil and
groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements. The Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing site,
issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for the Company to conduct an
investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations.
In January 2010, the Company, the US. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the State of Michigan ("State") entered
into an administrative order on consent that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a
remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA
and the State under the authority of CERCLA. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information. At December 31, 2016, the Company had an accrual of $137 million ($92 million at December 31, 2015) for
environmental remediation and investigation associated with the Midland sites. In 2016, the Company spent $36 million
($28 million in 2015) for environmental remediation at the Midland sites.
