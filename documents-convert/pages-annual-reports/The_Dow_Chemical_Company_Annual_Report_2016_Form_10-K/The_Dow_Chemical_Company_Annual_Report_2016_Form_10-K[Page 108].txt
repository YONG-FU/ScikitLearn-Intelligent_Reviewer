Portfolio managers regularly review the Company ’s holdings to determine if any investments are other-than-temporarily
impaired. The analysis includes reviewing the amount of the impairment, as well as the length of time it has been impaired. In
addition, specific guidelines for each instrument type are followed to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment has
occurred.
For debt securities, the credit rating of the issuer, current credit rating trends, the trends of the issuer’s overall sector, the ability
of the issuer to pay expected cash ﬂows and the length of time the security has been in a loss position are considered in
determining whether unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment. The Company did not have any credit-
related losses during 2016, 2015 or 2014.
For equity securities, the Company’s investments are primarily in Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 companies; however, the
Company’s policies allow investments in companies outside of the S&P 500. The largest holdings are Exchange Traded Funds
that represent the S&P 500 index or an S&P 500 sector or subset; the Company also has holdings in Exchange Traded Funds
that represent emerging markets. The Company considers the evidence to support the recovery of the cost basis of a security
including volatility of the stock, the length of time the security has been in a loss position, value and growth expectations, and
overall market and sector fundamentals, as well as technical analysis, in determining whether unrealized losses represent an
other-than-temporary impairment. In 2016, there were no other-than-temporary impairment write-downs on investments still
held by the Company ($2 million in 2015).
The aggregate cost of the Company's cost method investments totaled $120 million at December 31, 2016 ($157 million at
December 31, 2015). Due to the nature of these investments, either the cost basis approximates fair market value or fair value is
not readily determinable. These investments are reviewed quarterly for impairment indicators. In 2016, a write-down of
$4 million was recorded as part of the 2016 restructuring charge. In 2015, a write-down of $55 million was recorded as part of
the 2015 restructuring charge. See Note 3 for more information on the Company's restructuring activities. The Company's
impairment analysis resulted in no additional reductions in the cost basis of these investments for the year ended December 31,
2016; the analysis in 2015 resulted in additional reductions of less than $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Risk Management
Dow’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into
hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial
market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as cash ﬂow, fair value or net foreign investment hedges where
appropriate. Accounting guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair
value. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposures within established limits and policies;
