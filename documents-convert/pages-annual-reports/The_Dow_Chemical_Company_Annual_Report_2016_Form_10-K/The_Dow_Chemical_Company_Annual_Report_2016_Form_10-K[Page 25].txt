Dow’s primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect the results of its research for use in operations and licensing. Dow is
also party to a substantial number of patent licenses and other technology agreements. The Company had revenue related to
patent and technology royalties totaling $394 million in 2016, $357 million in 2015 and $388 million in 2014. The Company
incurred royalties to others of $191 million in 2016, $198 million in 2015 and $170 million in 2014. Dow also has a substantial
number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries, including the “Dow in Diamond”
trademark. Although the Company considers that its patents, licenses and trademarks in the aggregate constitute a valuable
asset, it does not regard its business as being materially dependent on any single or group of related patents, licenses or
trademarks.
