subordinated notes while maintaining servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable. The carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets pertaining to this entity were current assets of $477 million
(zero restricted) at December 31, 2016 ($103 million, zero restricted, at December 31, 2015) and current liabilities of less than

Noneonsolidated Variable Interest Entities
As a result of the DCC Transaction, the Company holds variable interests in Hemlock Semiconductor L.L.C. The variable
interests relate to an equity interest held by the Company and arrangements between the Company and the joint venture to
provide services. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not direct the activities that most significantly impact
the economic performance of this entity; therefore, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. At
December 31, 2016, the Company had a negative investment basis of $902 million in this joint venture, which is classified as
"Other noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss was zero at
December 31, 2016. See Note 9 for additional information on this variable interest entity.
Also as a result of the DCC Transaction, the Company holds minority voting interests in certain joint ventures that produce
silicon inputs for the Company. These joint ventures operate under supply agreements that sell inventory to the equity owners
using pricing mechanisms that guarantee a return, therefore shielding the joint ventures from the obligation to absorb expected
losses. As a result of the pricing mechanisms of these agreements, these entities are determined to be variable interest entities.
The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact
the economic performance of these entities; therefore, the entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The

carrying value of the investment in these entities. At December 31, 2016, the Company's investment in these joint ventures was
$96 million and is classified as "Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets, representing the
Company's maximum exposure to loss.
