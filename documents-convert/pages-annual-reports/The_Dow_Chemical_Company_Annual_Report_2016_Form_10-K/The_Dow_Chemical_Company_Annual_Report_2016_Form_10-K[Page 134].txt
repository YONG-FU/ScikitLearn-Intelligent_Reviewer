The Company’s funding policy is to contribute to the plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage
funding. In 2016, Dow contributed $629 million to its pension plans, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its
non-qualified supplemental plans. Dow expects to contribute approximately $500 million to its pension plans in 2017.
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit costs for the plans are
provided in the two tables below:

The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by performing a detailed analysis of key
economic and market factors driving historical returns for each asset class and formulating a projected return based on factors
in the current environment. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, inﬂation, real economic growth, interest rate
yield, interest rate spreads, and other valuation measures and market metrics. The expected long-term rate of return for each
asset class is then weighted based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the governing body for each plan. The
Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered.
Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the
service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the US. and other
selected countries. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual
spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATEzLink yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each
selected country to the separate expected cash ﬂow components of service cost and interest cost; service cost and interest cost
for all other plans (including all plans prior to adoption) are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates
derived in determining those plan obligations. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of
interest and service costs for certain countries by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash ﬂows and the
discrete spot yield curves. The Company accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and it was applied
prospectively starting in 2016.
The discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the US. qualified plans are based on
the yield on high—quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined
cash ﬂows for Dow’s US. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATEzLink
60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s
obligations as of the measurement date.
In 2014, the Society of Actuaries ("SOA") published updated mortality tables and mortality improvement scales (generational
mortality tables), which reﬂect increased life expectancy. Based on an evaluation of the mortality experience of the Company's
U.S. pension plans and the SOA's tables, effective for 2014 and forward, the Company adopted updated generational mortality
tables for purposes of measuring U.S. pension and other postretirement obligations.
