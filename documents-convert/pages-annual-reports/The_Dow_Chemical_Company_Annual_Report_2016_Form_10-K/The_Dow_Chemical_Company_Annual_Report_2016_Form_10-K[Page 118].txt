[Stock options and deferred stock awards excluded from EPS calculations (5) 1.9 4.6 5.8
(1) Deferred stock awards are considered participating securities due to Dow's practice of paying dividend equivalents on
unvested shares.
(2) Preferred stock dividends were not added back in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods ended December
31, 2016 and December 31, 2014, because the effect of an assumed conversion of the Company's Cumulative Convertible
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ("Preferred Stock") would have been antidilutive.
(3) On December 30, 2016, the Company converted 4 million shares of Preferred Stock into 96.8 million shares of the Company's
common stock. As a result of this conversion, 0.5 million shares of common stock are included in "Weighted-average common
shares - basic” for the period ended December 31, 2016.
(4) The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the period ending December 31, 2016, excludes 96.3 million shares of
common stock because the effect of an assumed conversion of Preferred Stock for the full period would have been antidilutive
(excludes 96.8 million shares for the period ended December 31, 2014).
(5) These deferred stock awards and outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation
of diluted earnings per share because the eﬁect of including them would have been antidilutive.
