related to the early extinguishment of debt, included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of
income and reﬂected in Corporate.
On October 5, 2015, (i) the Company completed the transfer of its US. Gulf Coast Chlor—Alkali and Vinyl, Global Chlorinated
Organics and Global Epoxy businesses into a new company ("Splitco"), (ii) participating Dow shareholders tendered, and the
Company accepted, Dow shares for Splitco shares in a public exchange oﬁer, and (iii) Splitco merged with a wholly owned
subsidiary of Olin in a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction (collectively, the “Transaction”). Under the terms of a debt
exchange offer, the Company received $1,220 million principal amount of new debt instruments from Splitco, which were
subsequently transferred to certain investment banks in a non-cash fair value exchange for $1,154 million principal amount of
the Company’s outstanding debt instruments owned by such investment banks. As a result of this debt exchange offer and
related transactions, the Company retired $1,161 million of certain notes, including $401 million of 2.50 percent notes due
2016, $182 million of 5.70 percent notes due 2018, $278 million of 4.25 percent notes due 2020 and a $300 million Term Loan
Facility with a maturity date of 2016. The Company recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $68 million,
included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income as a component of the pretax gain on the
Transaction and reﬂected in Corporate. In connection with the Transaction, a membrane chlor-alkali joint venture was included
as part of the assets and liabilities divested. This resulted in an additional reduction of $569 million principal amount of debt.
