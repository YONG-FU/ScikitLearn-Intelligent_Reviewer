There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.
For assets classified as Level 3 measurements, the fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions
where there is little, if any, market activity. The fair value of the Company’s interests held in trade receivable conduits is
determined by calculating the expected amount of cash to be received using the key input of anticipated credit losses in the
portfolio of receivables sold that have not yet been collected. Given the short-term nature of the underlying receivables,
discount rate and prepayments are not factors in determining the fair value of the interests. See Note 16 for further information
on assets classified as Level 3 measurements.
The following table summarizes the changes in fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31,
2016 and 2015:

2016 Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis
As part of the 2016 restructuring plan, the Company has or will shut down a number of manufacturing and corporate facilities.
The manufacturing facilities and related assets, corporate facilities and data centers associated with this plan were written down
to zero in the second quarter of 2016. The Company also rationalized its aircraft ﬂeet in the second quarter of 2016. Certain
aircraft, classified as a Level 3 measurement, were considered held for sale and written down to fair value, using unobservable
inputs, including assumptions a market participant would use to measure the fair value of the aircraft. The aircraft were
subsequently sold during the second half of 20 16. The impairment charges related to the 2016 restructuring plan, totaling
$153 million, were included in "Restructuring charges (credits)” in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 3 for
additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.
The Company recognized an impairment charge of $143 million in the fourth quarter of 20 16, related to its equity interest in
AFSI. This investment, classified as a Level 1 measurement, was written down to $46 million using quoted prices in an active
market. The impairment charge was included in “Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and
reﬂected in Agricultural Sciences. See Notes 5, 9 and 13 for additional information.
