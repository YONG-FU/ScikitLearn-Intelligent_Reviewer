term of the awards and current implied volatility from exchange-traded options. The expected volatility assumption for the
market portion of the performance deferred stock awards was based on historical daily volatility for the term of the award. The
risk-free interest rate was based on the weighted-average of US. Treasury strip rates over the contractual term of the options.
The expected life of stock options granted was based on an analysis of historical exercise patterns.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On February 9, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized The Dow Chemical Company 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
which was approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting on May 10, 2012. Under the 2016 annual offering, most

price of the stock is set at an amount equal to at least 85 percent of the fair market value (closing price) of the common stock on
a date during the fourth quarter of the year prior to the oﬁering, or the average fair market value (closing price) of the common
stock over a period during the fourth quarter of the year prior to the offering, in each case, specified by the Vice President of
Human Resources.

Stock Incentive Plan
The Company has historically granted equity awards under various plans (the "Prior Plans"). On February 9, 2012, the Board of
Directors authorized The Dow Chemical Company 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2012 Plan”), which was approved by
stockholders at the Company's annual meeting on May 10, 2012 ("Original Effective Date") and became effective on that date.
On February 13, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted The Dow Chemical Company Amended and Restated 2012 Stock
Incentive Plan (the "2012 Restated Plan"). The 2012 Restated Plan was approved by stockholders at the Company's annual
meeting on May 15, 2014 and became effective on that date. The Prior Plans were superseded by the 2012 Plan and the 2012
Restated Plan (collectively, the "2012 Plan"). Under the 2012 Plan, the Company may grant options, deferred stock,
performance deferred stock, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock units to employees and non-employee directors
until the tenth anniversary of the Original Effective Date, subject to an aggregate limit and annual individual limits. The terms
of the grants are fixed at the grant date. At December 31, 2016, there were approximately 45 million shares available for grant
under the 2012 Plan.
Stock Options
The Company grants stock options to certain employees, subject to certain annual and individual limits, with terms of the
grants fixed at the grant date. The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of the Company’s stock on the
grant date. Options vest from one to three years, and have a maximum term of 10 years.
