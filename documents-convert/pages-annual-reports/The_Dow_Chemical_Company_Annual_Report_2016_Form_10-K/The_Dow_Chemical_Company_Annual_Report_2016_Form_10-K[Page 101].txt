At December 31, 2015, the Company’s investment in Dow Corning was $149 million less than the Company’s proportionate
share of Dow Corning’s underlying net assets. This amount was considered a permanent difference related to the other-than-
temporary decline in the Company's investment in Dow Corning, triggered by Dow Corning's May 15, 1995, bankruptcy filing,
and Dow Corning's purchase of additional ownership interests in its HSC Group in 2013.
MEGlobal and EQ UAT E
On December 23, 2015, the Company sold its interest in MEGlobal to EQUATE. The Company eliminated 42.5 percent of the
gain on the sale (equivalent to Dow's ownership interest in EQUATE), or $555 million, against the Company's investment in
EQUATE, resulting in a negative investment of $148 million at December 31, 2015, which is classified as "Other noncurrent
obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's investment in EQUATE was $555 million less than the
Company's proportionate share of EQUATE'S underlying net assets, which represents the difference between the preliminary
fair values of certain MEGlobal assets acquired and the Company's related valuation on a US. GAAP basis, of which
approximately $250 million was being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets and approximately $305 million
was considered a permanent difference. At December 31, 2016, the negative investment balance was $128 million and the
Company's investment in EQUATE was $536 million less than the Company's proportionate share of EQUATE's underlying net
assets, of which $216 million of the difference is being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets and the
remainder is considered a permanent difference.
AFSI
On July 31, 2015, the Company sold its AgroFresh business to AF SI. Proceeds received on the divestiture of AgroFresh
included 17.5 million common shares of AFSI, which were valued at $210 million and represented an approximate 35 percent
ownership interest in AFSI. Based on the December 31, 2016 closing stock price of AF SI, the value of this investment would
have been lower than the carrying value by $143 million ($80 million based on the closing stock price at December 31, 2015).
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company determined the decline in market value of AF SI was other-than-temporary and
recognized a $143 million pretax impairment charge related to its equity interest in AFSI. The impairment charge was included
in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and reﬂected in the Agricultural Sciences
segment. At December 31, 2016, the Company's investment in AFSI was $96 million less than the Company's proportionate
share of AF SI's underlying net assets. This amount primarily relates to the other-than-temporary decline in the Company's
investment in AF SI. See Notes 5, 12 and 20 for further information on this investment.
Sadara
The Company and Saudi Arabian Oil Company formed Sadara Chemical Company ("Sadara") to build and operate a world-
scale, fully integrated chemicals complex in Jubail Industrial City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Sadara achieved its first
polyethylene production in December 2015 and announced the start-up of its mixed feed cracker and a third polyethylene train
(which added to the two polyethylene trains already in operation) in August 2016. Sadara will follow a phased approach to start
up the remaining manufacturing facilities. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a $258 million note receivable with
Sadara, included in "Noncurrent receivables" in the consolidated balance sheets, of which $193 million is expected to be
converted to equity in the first quarter of 2017 ($473 million at December 31, 2015, of which $460 million was converted to
equity in the first quarter of 2016). During 2016, the Company loaned $1,015 million to Sadara and $1,230 million was
converted to equity.
