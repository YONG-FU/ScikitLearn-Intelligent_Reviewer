SEGMENT RESULTS
The Company uses EBITDA (which Dow defines as earnings (i.e., "Net Income") before interest, income taxes, depreciation
and amortization) as its measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes. EBITDA by operating segment includes all
operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to the Company as a whole are assigned to Corporate. In
the segment discussions that follow, the Company provides EBITDA excluding certain items. Due to the nature of these certain
items, they do not reﬂect the ongoing operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, Dow's management believes
presenting EBITDA excluding certain items is useful for investors as it provides financial information on a more comparative
basis for the periods presented. EBITDA excluding certain items is not recognized in accordance with US. GAAP and should
not be viewed as an alternative to US. GAAP financial measures of performance. Additional information regarding the
Company's operating segments and a reconciliation of “Income Before Income Taxes” to EBITDA can be found in Note 26 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Due to the completion of several acquisitions and divestitures (see Notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
the change in sales volume from 2015 to 2016, 2014 to 2015 and 2013 to 2014 excluding acquisitions and divestitures is also
provided by operating segment, where applicable.
