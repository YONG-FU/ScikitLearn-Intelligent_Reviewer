2016 Versus 2015
Agricultural Sciences sales were $6,174 million in 2016, down 3 percent from $6,381 million in 2015. Compared with the same
period last year, volume decreased 3 percent and price was ﬂat. Sales declined in all geographic areas, except Latin America, as
low crop commodity prices continued to drive a slow-growth agricultural market. Crop Protection sales decreased 6 percent
compared with 2015, driven primarily by the AgroFresh divestiture, currency headwinds and reduced demand for insecticides
and herbicides, primarily glyphosate. Seeds sales increased 7 percent compared with 2015, as strong demand and price
increases for corn seeds in Latin America more than offset the impact of product lines divested in 2015 and lower demand for
sunﬂower and cotton seeds. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, volume for the segment declined 2 percent.
EBITDA for 2016 was $806 million, down $626 million from $1,432 million in 2015. EBITDA for 2016 was impacted by a
$143 million impairment charge related to the Company's equity interest in AFSI, a $20 million charge related to post-closing
adjustments on the sale of AgroFresh, a $5 million unfavorable adjustment to the 2015 restructuring charge, and a $2 million
charge for environmental matters. EBITDA for 2015 was impacted by a gain of $618 million related to the divestiture of
AgroFresh, $16 million of restructuring charges and a $29 million charge related to AFSI's fair value step-up of its inventories
and start-up costs. See Notes 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
these certain items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA increased compared with the same period last year as benefits from
lower operating costs driven by productivity initiatives and increased corn seeds sales more than offset lower sales of
herbicides and insecticides and the absence of earnings from AgroFresh and other product lines divested in 2015.
2015 Versus 2014
Agricultural Sciences sales were $6,381 million in 2015, down 12 percent from $7,290 million in 2014. Compared with 2014,
volume decreased 4 percent and price decreased 8 percent, including the unfavorable impact of currency which represented
approximately 40 percent of the price decline. Sales declined in all geographic areas and both businesses, impacted by lower
crop commodity prices, which drove a ﬂat agricultural market, coupled with currency headwinds. Despite a 6 percent increase
in new product sales, Crop Protection sales decreased 13 percent compared with 2014, partly driven by declines in glyphosate
and the divestiture of AgroFresh in the third quarter of 2015. Seeds reported an 11 percent decline in sales compared with 2014
as soybean seeds and canola seeds growth was more than offset by lower sales of corn seeds, primarily due to lower sales in the
Americas as a result of shifting acreage from corn to soybeans. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, volume for the segment
was down 3 percent.
EBITDA for 2015 was $1,432 million, up $470 million from $962 million in 2014. EBITDA for 2015 was favorably impacted
by $573 million of certain items, as previously discussed. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA declined from 2014 as lower
selling prices, softer demand due to lower crop commodity prices and the absence of earnings from the divestiture of the
