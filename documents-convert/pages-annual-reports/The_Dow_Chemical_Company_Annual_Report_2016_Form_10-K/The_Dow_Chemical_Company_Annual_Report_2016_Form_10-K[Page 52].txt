2016 Versus 2015
Infrastructure Solutions sales were $8,621 million in 2016, up 17 percent from $7,394 million in 2015. Volume increased
23 percent and price decreased 6 percent. Volume increased in all geographic areas, primarily reﬂecting the impact of
Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones, and in all businesses, except Energy & Water Solutions and Performance Monomers.
Excluding the impact of Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones, volume decreased 3 percent. Performance Monomers volume
decreased primarily due to the business' ongoing strategy to reduce its merchant sales of acrylic monomers as well as increased
internal consumption of acrylates. Volume decreased in Energy & Water Solutions across all geographic areas due to soft
demand for reverse osmosis membranes used in industrial application and weakness in the energy sector throughout the year.
Dow Coating Materials experienced volume growth in all geographic areas, except Latin America, with growth in architectural
and industrial coatings due to a strong innovation pipeline and expansion into new end markets. Dow Building & Construction
volume increased in all geographic areas, most notably in EMEAI, on strong growth in construction chemicals, primarily
cellulosics- and acrylics—based products. Price declined in all businesses and all geographic areas in response to lower raw
material prices and competitive pricing pressures.
EBITDA for 2016 was $2,318 million, up from $1,021 million in 2015. EBITDA for 2016 was impacted by a gain of
$1,144 million on the DCC Transaction, a loss of $170 million related to the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the
DCC Transaction, $96 million of restructuring charges, and a loss of $14 million related to early redemption of debt incurred by
Dow Corning. EBITDA for 2015 was impacted by $87 million of asset impairments and related costs in all businesses,
$26 million of restructuring charges and a gain of $ 12 million related to Dow Corning's adjustment of its implant liability. See
Notes 3, 4, 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these certain items. Excluding these
certain items, EBITDA increased $332 million compared with the prior year as earnings from Infrastructure Solutions -
Silicones, lower propylene and other raw material costs and increased equity earnings more than offset the impact of lower
selling prices.
2015 Versus 2014
Infrastructure Solutions sales were $7,394 million in 2015, down 12 percent from $8,429 million in 2014. Price decreased
14 percent, including the unfavorable impact of currency which represented one-third of the price decline, and volume
increased 2 percent. Price declined in all businesses, most notably in Performance Monomers, and all geographic areas in
response to lower raw material costs. Volume increased in all geographic areas, except North America, and all businesses,
except Energy & Water Solutions. Dow Building & Construction reported volume growth in EMEAI and North America, as
demand continued to be strong for innovative product offerings, primarily in construction chemicals. Dow Coating Materials
volume increased due to higher demand for architectural coatings in EMEAI and higher demand for industrial coatings in
North America. Volume increased in Performance Monomers due to higher demand and improved asset utilization for vinyl
