RAW MATERIALS
The Company operates in an integrated manufacturing environment. Basic raw materials are processed through many stages to
produce a number of products that are sold as finished goods at various points in those processes. The major raw material
stream that feeds the production of the Company’s finished goods is hydrocarbon-based raw materials. The Company purchases
hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and condensate as feedstocks. These raw materials are
used in the production of both saleable products and energy. The Company also purchases certain monomers, primarily
ethylene and propylene, to supplement internal production. The Company purchases natural gas, primarily to generate
electricity, and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation. The Company also produces a portion of its
electricity needs in Louisiana and Texas, Alberta, Canada; and Germany.
Expenditures for hydrocarbon feedstocks and energy accounted for 24 percent of the Company’s production costs and operating
expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company purchases these raw materials on both short— and long-term
contracts.
The Company had adequate supplies of raw materials during 2016, and expects to continue to have adequate supplies of raw
materials in 2017. Significant raw materials, by operating segment, are listed below:
