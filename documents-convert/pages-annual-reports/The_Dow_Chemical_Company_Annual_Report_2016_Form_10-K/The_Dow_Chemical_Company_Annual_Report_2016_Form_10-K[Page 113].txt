(1) Counterparty and cash collateral amounts represent the estimated net settlement amount when applying netting and set—oﬂ" rights
included in master netting arrangements between the Company and its counterparties and the cash collateral placed with the same
counterparty.
(2) Treasury Bills and money market funds included in "Cash and cash equivalents” in the consolidated balance sheets and held at amortized
cost, which approximates fair value.
(3) Included in "Accounts and notes receivable — Other" in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 16 for additional information on
transfers of financial assets.
(4) The Company’s investments in equity and debt securities are primarily classified as available-for—sale and are included in “Other

(5) US. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations, agency mortgage-backed securities and other municipalities’ obligations.

Assets and liabilities related to forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, options and other conditional or
exchange contracts executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement are netted. Collateral accounts are
netted with corresponding liabilities. The Company posted cash collateral of less than $1 million at December 31, 2016
($26 million of cash collateral at December 31, 2015).
For assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 measurements (measured using quoted prices in active markets), total fair value is
either the price of the most recent trade at the time of the market close or the official close price, as defined by the exchange on
which the asset is most actively traded on the last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of units held without
consideration of transaction costs.
For assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 measurements, where the security is frequently traded in less active markets, fair
value is based on the closing price at the end of the period; where the security is less frequently traded, fair value is based on
the price a dealer would pay for the security or similar securities, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability, or by
using observable market data points of similar, more liquid securities to imply the price. Market inputs are obtained from well-
established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks.
For derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial
instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates,
interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. Market inputs are obtained from well-established
and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance/quality checks.
For all other assets and liabilities for which observable inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value
models, such as a discounted cash ﬂow model or other standard pricing models. See Note 11 for further information on the
types of instruments used by the Company for risk management.
