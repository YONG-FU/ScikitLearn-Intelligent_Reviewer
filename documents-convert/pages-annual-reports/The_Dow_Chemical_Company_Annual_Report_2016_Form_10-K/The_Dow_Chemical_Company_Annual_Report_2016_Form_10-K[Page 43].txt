Restructuring Charges (Credits)
On June 27, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a restructuring plan that incorporates actions related to the
DCC Transaction. These actions, aligned with Dow’s value growth and synergy targets, will result in a global workforce
reduction of approximately 2,500 positions, with most of these positions resulting from synergies related to the DCC
Transaction. These actions are expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 2018. As a result, the Company recorded
pretax restructuring charges of $449 million in the second quarter of 2016 consisting of severance costs of $268 million, asset
write-downs and write-offs of $153 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $28 million and reﬂected in
the Company's segments results as follows: $28 million in Consumer Solutions, $97 million in Infrastructure Solutions,
$10 million in Performance Plastics and $314 million in Corporate.
On April 29, 2015, Dow's Board of Directors approved actions to further streamline the organization and optimize the
Company’s footprint as a result of the split-off of the chlorine value chain. These actions, which further accelerate Dow’s value
growth and productivity targets, will result in a reduction of approximately 1,750 positions across a number of businesses and
functions and adjustments to the Company's asset footprint to enhance competitiveness. These actions are expected to be
completed primarily by June 30, 2017. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of
$375 million in the second quarter of 2015 consisting of severance costs of $196 million, asset write-downs and write-offs of
$169 million and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $ 10 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company
recorded a restructuring charge adjustment of $40 million, primarily related to severance costs for the separation of
approximately 500 additional positions. The impact of these charges was reﬂected in the Company's segment results as follows:
$16 million in Agricultural Sciences, $67 million in Consumer Solutions, $26 million in Infrastructure Solutions, $12 million in
Performance Plastics and $294 million in Corporate.
In 2016, the Company recorded an unfavorable restructuring charge adjustment of $6 million for additional accruals for costs
associated with exit and disposal activities and a favorable adjustment of $3 million for the impairment of long-lived assets
related to the 2015 Restructuring plan. The net charge was included in the Company's segment results as follows: $5 million
charge in Agricultural Sciences, $1 million charge in Consumer Solutions and a $3 million gain in Infrastructure Solutions.
