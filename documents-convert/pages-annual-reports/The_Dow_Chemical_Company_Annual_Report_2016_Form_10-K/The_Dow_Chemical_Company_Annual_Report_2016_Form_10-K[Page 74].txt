Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation
Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past
four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and
frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the
past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide ’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility
for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate
that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from
exposure to Union Carbide’s products.
The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on
criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants. Union Carbide had a significant increase in the number of
claims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved in 2015 resulting from a detailed review of the status of individual claims and an
update to criteria used to classify claims.
Asbestos—Related Claim Activity 2016 2015 2014;
|Claims unresolved at January 1 18,778 26,116 29,005 I
Claims filed 7,813 7,544 8,857
lClaims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved (10,450) (14,882) (11,746)]

lClaimants with claims against both UCC and Amchem (5,741) (6,804) (8,209)]
;Individual claimants at December 31 10,400 11,974 17,907;
Plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the
damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when
specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no asbestos personal injury cases in
which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s
litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem
to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.
