Gross Margin
Gross margin was $10.5 billion in 2016, $10.9 billion in 2015 and $10.7 billion in 2014. Gross margin in 2016 was impacted by
a $317 million loss associated with the fair value step-up in inventories acquired in the DCC Transaction, reﬂected in Consumer
Solutions ($147 million) and Infrastructure Solutions ($170 million); a $295 million charge for environmental matters, reﬂected
in Agricultural Sciences ($2 million), Performance Materials & Chemicals ($1 million), Performance Plastics ($2 million) and
Corporate ($290 million); $124 million of costs associated with transactions and productivity actions (reﬂected in Corporate);
and a $117 million charge for the termination of a terminal use agreement (reﬂected in Performance Plastics). Excluding these
items, gross margin increased compared with 2015 as lower feedstock, energy and other raw material costs, cost cutting and
productivity initiatives, higher sales volume and the favorable impact from the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business
more than offset lower selling prices. See Notes 4 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding these items.
Gross margin increased in 2015 driven by an $8,542 million decrease in purchased feedstock and energy costs and the favorable
impact of currency on costs which was partially offset by lower selling prices, including the unfavorable impact of currency. In
2015, gross margin was reduced by $91 million of charges for asset impairments and related costs, including the shutdown of
manufacturing assets and facilities in the Dow Building & Construction, Energy & Water Solutions and Dow Packaging and
Specialty Plastics businesses and the abandonment of certain capital projects in the Dow Building & Construction and Dow
Coating Materials businesses and reﬂected in the following segments: Infrastructure Solutions ($34 million) and Performance
Plastics ($57 million). Gross margin was also reduced by $24 million of costs associated with transactions and productivity
actions (reﬂected in Corporate) and a $12 million loss related to Univation Technologies, LLC ("Univation") for the fair value
step-up of inventories assumed in the step acquisition (reﬂected in Performance Plastics). See Notes 4 and 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these items.
Gross margin in 2014 was positively impacted by increased sales volume, a $392 million decrease in purchased feedstock and
energy costs, lower other raw material costs and increased operating rates. Gross margin in 2014 was reduced by a $100 million
warranty accrual adjustment related to an exited business (reﬂected in Infrastructure Solutions) and by $23 million for asset
impairments related to the Dow Electronic Materials business (reﬂected in Consumer Solutions). See Notes 12 and 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these items.
Operating Rate
Dow's global plant operating rate was 85 percent of capacity in 2016, ﬂat compared with 2015 and 2014.
Personnel Count
The Company permanently employed approximately 56,000 people at December 31, 2016, up from approximately 46,500 at
December 31, 2015. Headcount increased in 2016 primarily due to the DCC Transaction, which was partially offset by a
decline related to the Company's restructuring programs. Personnel count at December 31, 2015, decreased from approximately
50,000 at December 31, 2014, primarily due to the separation of employees as a result of divestitures and the Company's
restructuring programs.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $1,584 million in 2016, compared with $1,598 million in 2015 and
$1,647 million in 2014. In 2016, R&D expenses decreased slightly compared with 2015, as increased costs from Dow Corning's
silicones business were more than oﬁset by decreased spending due to divestitures and cost reduction initiatives as well as
lower performance-based compensation costs. In 2015, R&D expenses decreased primarily due to cost reduction initiatives,
notably in Agricultural Sciences, which were partially offset by increased performance-based compensation costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $3,304 million in 2016, compared with $2,971 million in 2015
and $3,106 million in 2014. In 2016, SG&A was negatively impacted by $379 million of costs associated with transactions and
productivity actions, reﬂected in Corporate ($51 million in 2015). Excluding these items, SG&A expenses were essentially ﬂat
in 2016 compared with 2015, as increased costs from Dow Corning's silicones business were nearly offset by decreased
spending due to divestitures and cost reduction initiatives as well as lower performance-based compensation costs. In 2015,
SG&A expenses decreased as lower expenses, notably in Agricultural Sciences, and from the impact of divestitures, more than
offset increased performance-based compensation costs.
