Competition
Competitors of the Infrastructure Solutions segment include many large multinational chemical firms as well as a number of
regional and local competitors. The segment's products have unique performance characteristics that are required by customers
who demand a high level of customer service and expertise from its sales force and scientists; therefore, Dow is well positioned
to withstand competitive threats. Key competitors include Arkema, Ashland, BASF, Bluestar, Elementis, Hydranautics,
Lanxess, Lonza, Momentive, Owens-Corning, Shin-Etsu Chemical and Wacker.
Joint Ventures
The Infrastructure Solutions segment includes a portion of the Company's share of the results of the HSC Group, a U.S.-based
group of companies that manufacture polycrystalline silicon products, which is owned 50 percent by the Company.
As of June 1, 2016, Dow Corning, previously a 50:50 joint venture with Corning, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow
as a result of the DCC Transaction. Dow and Coming continue to maintain their historical proportional equity interest in the
HSC Group. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this transaction.
