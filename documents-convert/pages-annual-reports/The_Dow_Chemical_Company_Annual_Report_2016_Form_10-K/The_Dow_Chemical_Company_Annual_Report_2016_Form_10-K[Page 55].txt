In 2017, Sadara is expected to start up a number of manufacturing facilities, including units that will produce glycol ethers,
ethanolamines, ethyleneamines, polyols and propylene glycol. Dow is responsible for marketing the majority of Sadara
products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company's established sales channels. As part of this arrangement, the
Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee.
PERFORMANCE PLASTICS
The Performance Plastics segment is a market-oriented portfolio comprised of Dow Elastomers, Dow Electrical and
Telecommunications, Dow Packaging and Specialty Plastics, Energy and Hydrocarbons. The segment also includes the results
of TKSC, The SCG—Dow Group as well as a portion of the results of EQUATE, TKOC, Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited
and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.
On May 5, 2015, Univation, previously a 50:50 joint venture between Dow and ExxonMobil, became a wholly owned
subsidiary of Dow. Prior to this transaction, the Company's share of Univation's results of operations was reported as "Equity in
earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated statements of income. Beginning in May 2015, Univation's results of
operations are fully consolidated in the Company's consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on this step acquisition.
Sales for the Energy business are primarily opportunistic merchant sales driven by market conditions and sales to customers
located on Dow manufacturing sites. Sales for the Hydrocarbons business are comprised primarily of monomers and ethylene
by-products that are not required for internal use. Hydrocarbons sales can ﬂuctuate significantly based on ethylene production
facility feedslates and operating rates, derivative demand and market prices for monomers and by-products.

2016 Versus 2015
Performance Plastics sales for 2016 were $18,404 million, essentially ﬂat from $18,357 million in 2015, with volume up
8 percent and price down 8 percent. Price decreased across all geographic areas and all businesses in response to lower
feedstock, energy and other raw material prices and competitive pricing pressures. Double-digit price declines were reported in
Hydrocarbons as a result of lower Brent crude oil prices, which declined approximately 16 percent compared with 2015.
Volume increased across all geographic areas and all businesses. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, volume increased
9 percent. Volume increased in the Hydrocarbons and Energy businesses due to third party supply agreements. Dow Packaging
and Specialty Plastics volume increased due to demand growth in all market segments, most notably in industrial and consumer
packaging and health and hygiene, and in Asia Pacific due to new production from Sadara. Dow Elastomers volume improved
across all geographic areas, except Latin America, primarily due to higher demand in the transportation, consumer goods and
footwear market sectors. Dow Electrical and Telecommunications volume increased across all geographic areas due to
continued demand for power cable installations and fiber optics.
The Company uses derivatives of crude oil and natural gas as feedstock in its ethylene facilities. In addition, the Company
purchases electric power, ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production, as well as other raw materials. The
Company's cost of purchased feedstock and energy decreased $1,449 million in 2016, a 12 percent decrease from 2015,
primarily due to decreased naptha and condensate costs in Europe and decreased purchased monomers costs across all
geographic areas.
EBITDA for 2016 was $4,503 million, down from $5,399 million in 2015. EBITDA for 2016 was impacted by $10 million of
restructuring charges, a $2 million environmental charge and a $117 million charge related to the termination of a terminal use
agreement. EBITDA for 2015 was impacted by a gain of $349 million related to the step acquisition of Univation, a
$317 million gain related to the split-off of the chlorine value chain, and $57 million of asset impairments and related costs and
$12 million of restructuring charges, consisting of asset write-downs and write-offs. See Notes 3, 4, 6, 12 and 15 to the
