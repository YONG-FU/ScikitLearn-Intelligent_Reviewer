Change in Method of Accounting for Asbestos-Related Matters - Legal Costs
In September 2014, Union Carbide Corporation ("Union Carbide"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, began to
implement a strategy designed to reduce and to ultimately stabilize and forecast defense and processing costs associated with
asbestos-related matters. The strategy included a number of important changes including: invoicing protocols including
capturing costs by plaintiff and review of existing counsel roles, work processes and workflow. Union Carbide also began
utilizing enterprise legal management software, which enabled claim-specific tracking of asbestos-related defense costs. Union
Carbide reviewed the information generated from this new strategy and determined that it now had the ability to reasonably
estimate asbestos-related defense and processing costs for the same periods that it estimates asbestos-related resolution costs
for pending and future claims. Union Carbide believes that including estimates of the liability for asbestos-related defense and
processing costs provides a more complete assessment and measure of the liability associated with resolving asbestos-related
matters, which Union Carbide and the Company believe is preferable in these circumstances.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for Union Carbide's asbestos-related
defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. The Company believes this
change is preferable as asbestos-related defense and processing costs represent expenditures related to legacy activities that do
not contribute to current or future revenue generating activities. The change is also reﬂective of the manner in which Union
Carbide manages the asbestos-related exposure, including careful monitoring of the correlation between defense spending and
resolution costs. Together, these two sources of cost more accurately represent the “total cost” of resolving asbestos-related
claims now and in the future.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company added a new accounting policy for asbestos-related matters and updated its existing
accounting policy for legal costs, as follows:
Asbestos-Related Matters
Accruals for asbestos-related matters, including defense and processing costs, are recorded based on an analysis of
claim and resolution activity, defense spending, and pending and future claims. These accruals are assessed at each
balance sheet date to determine if the asbestos—related liability remains appropriate. Accruals for asbestos-related
matters are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Asbestos-related
liabilities - noncurrent.”
Legal Costs
The Company expenses legal costs as incurred, with the exception of defense and processing costs associated with
asbestos-related matters.
This accounting policy change has been reﬂected as a change in accounting estimate eﬁected by a change in accounting
principle. As a result of this accounting policy change, the Company recorded a pretax charge for asbestos-related defense and
processing costs of $1,009 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, included in “Asbestos-related charge” in the consolidated
statements of income (after-tax loss of $636 million or $0.57 per share). The Company’s total asbestos-related liability,
including defense and processing costs, was $1,490 million at December 31, 2016, and is included in “Accrued and other
