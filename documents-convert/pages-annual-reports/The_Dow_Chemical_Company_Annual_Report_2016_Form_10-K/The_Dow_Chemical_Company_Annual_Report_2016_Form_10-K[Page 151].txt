The tax rate for 2016 was favorably impacted by the non-taxable gain on the DCC Transaction and a tax benefit on the
reassessment of a deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in the Company’s investment in Dow Corning. The tax
rate was also favorably impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, the availability of foreign tax credits and the deductibility
of both the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases settlements and the asbestos-related charge. A reduction in
equity earnings and non-deductible costs associated with transactions and productivity actions unfavorably impacted the tax
rate. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 0.2 percent for 2016.
The tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by portfolio actions, specifically the tax-eﬁicient split-off of the chlorine value
chain, the non-taxable gain from the Univation step acquisition and the sale of MEGlobal. The geographic mix of earnings
favorably impacted the tax rate with the gain from the ANGUS Chemical Company divestiture and continued profitability
improvement in Europe and Asia Pacific providing most of the benefit. The tax rate was unfavorably impacted by foreign
subsidiaries repatriating cash to the United States, which was primarily derived from divestiture proceeds. Reduced equity
earnings and continued increases in statutory income in Latin America and Canada due to local currency devaluations also
unfavorably impacted the tax rate. These factors resulted in an eﬁective tax rate 0f21.6 percent for 2015.
The tax rate for 2014 was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, with the most notable components being
improved profitability in Europe and Asia Pacific as well as equity earnings providing additional favorable impact on the tax
rate. The tax rate was also favorably impacted by a reduction in the tax on remittances by foreign subsidiaries to the United
States. The tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a continued increase in statutory income in Latin America due to local
currency devaluations, and increase in valuation allowances, primarily in Asia Pacific. These factors resulted in an effective tax
rate of 27.1 percent for 2014.
