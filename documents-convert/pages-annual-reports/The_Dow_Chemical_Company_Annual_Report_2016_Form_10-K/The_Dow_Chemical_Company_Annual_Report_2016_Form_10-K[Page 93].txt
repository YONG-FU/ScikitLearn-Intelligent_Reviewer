closing costs and other comprehensive loss related to the Company's interest in Dow Corning. The gain was included in
"Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and reﬂected in the Consumer Solutions
($1,301 million) and Infrastructure Solutions ($1,144 million) segments. The Company recognized a tax benefit of
$141 million on the DCC Transaction in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to the reassessment of a previously
recognized deferred tax liability related to the basis difference in the Company’s investment in Dow Corning.

The DCC Transaction resulted in the recognition of $3,229 million of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill largely consists of expected synergies resulting from the DCC Transaction. Cost synergies will be achieved through a
combination of workforce consolidation and savings from actions such as harmonizing energy contracts at large sites,
optimizing warehouse and logistics footprints, implementing materials and maintenance best practices, combining information
technology service structures and leveraging existing research and development knowledge management systems. See Note 10
for additional information on goodwill, including the allocation by segment.
