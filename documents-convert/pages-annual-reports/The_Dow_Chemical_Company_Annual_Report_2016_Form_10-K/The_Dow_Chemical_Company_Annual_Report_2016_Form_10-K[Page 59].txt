Net working capital decreased from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016, principally due to a decrease in "Cash and cash
equivalents," primarily related to the settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases litigation, and an
increase in "Accounts payable" which were partially offset by increases in "Accounts and notes receivable" and "Inventories,"
reﬂecting the addition of Dow Corning's silicones business. At December 31, 2016, trade receivables were $4.7 billion, up from
$4.1 billion at December 31, 2015. Days-sales-outstanding-in—receivables (excluding the impact of sales of receivables) was
47 days at December 31, 2016, ﬂat compared with December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, total inventories were
$7.4 billion, up from $6.9 billion at December 31, 2015. Days-sales-in-inventory at December 31, 2016, was 67 days compared
with 72 days at December 31, 2015, primarily driven by higher sales volume and ﬂat operating rates, as well as strong
inventory management across all operating segments.
Cash F lows from Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities in 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures as well as investments in and loans to
nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara, which were partially offset by net cash acquired in the DCC Transaction.
Cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily for capital expenditures; purchases of investments, including the
repayment of outstanding loans issued under company-owned life insurance policies; and investments in and loans made to
nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. This was partially offset by proceeds received from divestitures, including the
divestitures of AN GUS Chemical Company and the AgroFresh business, proceeds from the sale of the Company's interest in
MEGlobal and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Cash used in investing activities in 2014 was primarily for
capital expenditures which was partially offset by proceeds received on the sale-leaseback of assets, including a significant
portion of the Company's North American railcar ﬂeet.
In the first quarter of 2015, a $193 million note receivable from Sadara was converted to equity. In 2015, the Company loaned
an additional $753 million to Sadara, of which $280 million was converted to equity. The Company loaned an additional
$1,015 million to Sadara in 2016, and $1,230 million was converted to equity. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a
$258 million note receivable with Sadara, of which $193 million is expected to be converted to equity in the first quarter of
2017. The Company expects to loan approximately $700 million to Sadara during 2017. All or a portion of the outstanding
loans to Sadara could potentially be converted into equity in future periods. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.
