Goodwill Impairments
The carrying amount of goodwill for all periods presented was net of accumulated impairments of $209 million in Consumer
Solutions and $220 million in Performance Materials & Chemicals.
Goodwill Impairment Testing
The Company performs an impairment test for goodwill annually during the fourth quarter. Qualitative factors may be assessed
by the Company to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
value. The qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term
hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial
performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and
market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material
prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit.
In 2016, the Company assessed qualitative factors for 11 of the 14 reporting units carrying goodwill (9 of 12 reporting units in
2015 and 9 of 14 reporting units in 2014). The qualitative assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that fair value
exceeded carrying value for those reporting units included in the qualitative test. The Company performed the first step of the
quantitative testing for the remaining three reporting units (three in 2015 and five in 2014). The Company utilized a discounted
cash ﬂow methodology to calculate the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the fair value analysis, management
concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units in 2016, 2015 and 2014. As a result, no additional
quantitative testing was required for the reporting units.
