NOTE 22 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A
Equity securities in the form of Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (“preferred series A”) were issued
on April 1, 2009 to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in the amount of $3 billion (3 million shares) and the Kuwait Investment Authority
in the amount of $1 billion (1 million shares). Shareholders of preferred series A could convert all or any portion of their shares,
at their option, at any time, into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion ratio of 24.2010 shares of
common stock for each share of preferred series A. On or after the fifth anniversary of the issuance date, if the common stock
price exceeded $53.72 per share for any 20 trading days in a consecutive 30-day window, the Company had the option, at any
time, in whole or in part, to convert preferred series A into common stock at the then applicable conversion rate.
On December 15, 2016, the trading price of Dow's common stock closed at $58.35, marking the 20th trading day in the
previous 30 trading days that the common stock closed above $53.72, triggering the right of the Company to exercise its
conversion right. On December 16, 2016, the Company sent a Notice of Conversion at the Option of the Company (the
"Notice") to all holders of its preferred series A. Pursuant to the Notice, on December 30, 2016 (the "Conversion Date") all
4 million outstanding shares of preferred series A were converted into shares of common stock at a conversion ratio of
24.2010 shares of common stock for each share of preferred series A, resulting in the issuance of 96.8 million shares of
common stock from treasury stock. From and after the Conversion Date, no shares of the preferred series A are issued or
outstanding and all rights of the holders of the preferred series A have terminated. On January 6, 2017, the Company filed an
amendment to the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation by way of a certificate of elimination (the “Certificate of
Elimination”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware which had the effect of: (a) eliminating the previously
designated 4 million shares of the preferred series A, none of which were outstanding at the time of the filing; (b) upon such
elimination, causing such preferred series A to resume the status of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Company, without designation as to series, and (c) eliminating from the Company’s Restated Certificate
of Incorporation all references to, and all matters set forth in, the certificates of designations for the preferred series A.
The Company paid cumulative dividends on preferred series A at a rate of 8.5 percent per annum, or $85 million per quarter.
The final dividend for the preferred series A was declared on December 15, 2016 and payable on the earlier of the Conversion
Date (if applicable) or January 3, 2017, to shareholders of record at December 15, 2016. The accrued dividend was paid in full
on the Conversion Date.
