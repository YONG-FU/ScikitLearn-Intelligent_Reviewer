The Company holds a variable interest in a joint venture that manufactures crude acrylic acid in the United States and Germany
on behalf of the Company and the other joint venture partner. The variable interest relates to a cost-plus arrangement between
the joint venture and each joint venture partner. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as a majority of the joint venture’s
output is committed to the other joint venture partner; therefore, the entity is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s investment in the joint venture was $171 million ($160 million at
December 31, 2015), classified as “Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates” in the consolidated balance sheets, representing
the Company’s maximum exposure to loss.
The Company holds variable interests in AFSI, a company that produces and sells proprietary technologies for the horticultural
market. The variable interests in AF SI relate to a sublease agreement between Dow and AFSI; a tax receivable agreement that
entitles Dow to additional consideration in the form of tax savings, which is contingent on the operations and earnings of AF SI;
and contingent consideration, which is subject to certain performance conditions. The Company is not the primary beneficiary,
as Dow is a minority shareholder in AFSI and AFSI is governed by a board of directors, the composition of which is mandated
by AF SI's corporate governance requirements that a majority of the directors be independent. At December 31, 2016, the
Company's investment in AFSI was $46 million ($191 million at December 31, 2015), and is classified as "Investment in
nonconsolidated affiliates" in the consolidated balance sheets. In the fourth quarter of 20 16, as a result of a decline in the
market value of AFSI, the Company recognized a $143 million pretax impairment charge related to its equity interest in AF SI
(see Notes 9 and 12 for further information). In addition, the Company has a receivable with AFSI related to the tax receivable
agreement of $ 12 million at December 31, 2016 (zero at December 31, 2015) and a receivable for six million warrants, valued
at $1 million at December 31, 2016 ($6 million at December 31, 2015), which are classified as "Accounts and notes receivable
- Other" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's maximum exposure to loss was $59 million at December 31, 2016
($197 million at December 31, 2015).
NOTE 21 — STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company provides stock-based compensation in the form of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which grants
eligible employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted price. The Company also
grants stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors in the form of stock incentive plans, which include
stock options, deferred stock, performance deferred stock and restricted stock. Information regarding these plans is provided
below.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company grants stock-based compensation awards that vest over a specified period or upon employees meeting certain
performance and/or retirement eligibility criteria. The fair value of equity instruments issued to employees is measured on the
grant date. The fair value of liability instruments issued to employees (specifically, performance deferred stock awards, which
are granted to executive employees subject to stock ownership requirements, that provide the recipient the option to elect to
receive a cash payment equal to the value of the stock award on the date of delivery) is measured at the end of each quarter. The
fair value of equity and liability instruments is expensed over the vesting period or, in the case of retirement, from the grant
date to the date on which retirement eligibility provisions have been met and additional service is no longer required.
The Company uses a lattice-based option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options, the Black-Scholes option
valuation model for subscriptions to purchase shares under the ESPP and Monte Carlo simulation for the market portion of
performance deferred stock awards. The weighted-average assumptions used to calculate total stock-based compensation are
included in the following table:

The dividend yield assumption for 2016 and 2015 was equal to the dividend yield on the grant date, which reﬂected the most
recent quarterly dividend payment of $0.46 per share in 2016 ($0.42 per share in 2015). The dividend yield assumption for
2014 was equal to the dividend yield on the grant date, which for stock options was the most recent quarterly dividend declared
on the grant date of $0.37 per share and for the ESPP was the first quarter dividend payment of $0.32 per share. The expected
volatility assumptions for stock options and ESPP were based on an equal weighting of the historical daily volatility for the
