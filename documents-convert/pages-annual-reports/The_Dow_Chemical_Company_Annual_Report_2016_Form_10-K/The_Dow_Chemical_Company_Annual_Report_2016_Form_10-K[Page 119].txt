NOTE 15 — COMJVIITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Environmental Matters
Introduction
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. At December 31, 2016, the Company had
accrued obligations of $909 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $151 million for
the remediation of Superfund sites. These obligations are included in "Accrued and other current liabilities" and "Other
noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and
restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably
possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount.
Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash ﬂows. It is the opinion of the
Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material
impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates
primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging
remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. At December 31, 2015, the Company had accrued
obligations of $670 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $74 million for the
remediation of Superfund sites.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $295 million for environmental remediation at a
number of historical locations, including the Midland manufacturing site/off-site matters and the Wood-Ridge sites, primarily
resulting from the culmination of negotiations with regulators and/or final agency approval. These charges are included in "Cost
of sales" in the consolidated statements of income and are included in the total accrued obligation of $909 million.
The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's accrued obligations for environmental matters for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:
Accrued Obligations for Environmental Matters

The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $504 million in 2016,
$218 million in 2015 and $227 million in 2014. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $66 million in 2016,
$49 million in 2015 and $78 million in 2014.
Midland Oﬂ-Site Environmental Matters
On June 12, 2003, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") issued a Hazardous Waste Operating
License (the "License") to the Company’s Midland, Michigan manufacturing site (the “Midland site”), which was renewed and
replaced by the MDEQ on September 25, 2015, and included provisions requiring the Company to conduct an investigation to
determine the nature and extent of oﬁ-site contamination in the City of Midland soils, the Tittabawassee River and Saginaw
River sediment and ﬂoodplain soils, and the Saginaw Bay, and, if necessary, undertake remedial action.
City of Midland
On March 6, 2012, the Company submitted an Interim Response Activity Plan Designed to Meet Criteria ("Work Plan") to
the MDEQ that involved the sampling of soil at residential properties near the Midland site for the presence of dioxins to
determine where clean-up may be required and then conducting remediation for properties that sampled above the
remediation criteria. The MDEQ approved the Work Plan on June 1, 2012 and implementation of the Work Plan began on
June 4, 2012. The Company also submitted and had approved by the MDEQ, amendments to the Work Plan. As of
December 31, 2014, remediation was completed on all 132 properties that tested above the remediation criteria, and this
completion is noted in the License. On July 21, 2016, the MDEQ approved a Corrective Action report, including a
Remedial Action Plan ("RAP"), for the City of Midland. This is the final regulatory approval required for the City of
Midland. Dow is implementing the monitoring and maintenance requirements of the RAP.
