2016 OVERVIEW
Dow had another strong year in 2016, delivering on a number of strategic priorities including progress on growth investments
and portfolio actions. A summary of financial highlights and other notable events are as follows:
Net sales for 2016 were $48.2 billion, down 1 percent from $48.8 billion in 2015, with volume up 5 percent and price down
6 percent. Sales declined in Performance Materials & Chemicals (down 23 percent, primarily due to the split-off of the chlorine
value chain) and Agricultural Sciences (down 3 percent) which more than offset sales increases in Consumer Solutions (up
25 percent) and Infrastructure Solutions (up 17 percent), both of which include Dow Corning Corporation's ("Dow Corning")
silicones business. Performance Plastics sales were ﬂat. Sales declined in all geographic areas, except Asia Pacific (up
10 percent).
Volume increased 5 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, as increases in Consumer Solutions (up 29 percent), Infrastructure
Solutions (up 23 percent), and Performance Plastics (up 8 percent) more than offset volume declines in Performance Materials
& Chemicals (down 14 percent) and Agricultural Sciences (down 3 percent). Volume increased in all geographic areas, except
Latin America (down 1 percent), including a double-digit increase in Asia Pacific (up 16 percent). Excluding the impact of
recent acquisitions and divestitures“), volume was up 4 percent with increases in all operating segments, except Infrastructure
Solutions (down 3 percent) and Agricultural Sciences (down 2 percent). On the same basis, volume increased in all geographic
areas, except Latin America which was ﬂat.
Price was down 6 percent in 2016 compared with 2015, driven by lower feedstock and raw material prices and competitive
pricing pressures. Price declines were reported in all operating segments, except Agricultural Sciences which was ﬂat, and all
geographic areas.
Dow's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in the second quarter of 2016 that incorporates actions related to the
ownership restructure of Dow Corning. These actions, aligned with Dow’s value growth and synergy targets, will result in a
global workforce reduction of approximately 2,500 positions, with most of these positions resulting from synergies related to
the Dow Corning transaction. As a result, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $449 million in 2016 related to
this plan.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company changed its method of accounting for asbestos-related defense and processing costs
from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability through the expected terminal date of 2049, resulting in a
charge of $1,009 million. The Company also increased its asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims through the
expected terminal date of 2049, resulting in an additional charge of $104 million.
Dow's earnings from nonconsolidated affiliates totaled $442 million in 2016, down from $674 million in 2015. In 2016, equity
earnings decreased as higher earnings from The SCG—Dow Group, Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited and the HSC Group
were more than offset by higher equity losses from Sadara Chemical Company ("Sadara") related to start-up expenses, and
lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures as a result of lower monoethylene glycol prices and a reduction in the
ownership of MEGlobal (now part of EQUATE Petrochemicals Company K.S.C. ("EQUATE")). Equity earnings also declined
as a result of the ownership restructure of Dow Corning ("DCC Transaction").
Sundry income (expense) - net was income of $1,202 million in 2016, reﬂecting a gain related to the DCC Transaction partially
offset by a loss related to the Company's settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and the opt-out cases litigation.
The provision for income taxes was $9 million in 2016, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 0.2 percent, down from
$2,147 million in 2015, or an effective tax rate of 21 .6 percent. The provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the
non-taxable gain on the DCC Transaction, a tax benefit on the reassessment of a deferred tax liability related to the basis
difference in the Company’s investment in Dow Corning and the deductibility of both the urethane matters class action lawsuit
and opt-out cases settlements and the asbestos-related charge resulting from the change in accounting policy.
The Company resumed its share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2016 after the shareholder vote on the DowDuPont
merger on July 20, 2016. During 2016, the Company executed $916 million in share repurchases. At December 31, 2016,
$1.4 billion of the share buy-back authorization remained available for repurchases.
