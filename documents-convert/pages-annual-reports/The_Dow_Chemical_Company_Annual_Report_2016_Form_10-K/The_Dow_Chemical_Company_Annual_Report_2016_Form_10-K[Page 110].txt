foreign currency hedge ineﬁectiveness. At December 31, 2016, the Company had open contracts with various expiration dates
to buy, sell or exchange foreign currencies with a notional US. dollar equivalent of $1,411 million ($398 million at
December 31, 2015).
Commodity swaps, futures and option contracts with maturities of not more than 48 months are utilized and designated as cash
ﬂow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. Current open contracts hedge forecasted transactions until December 2020.
The effective portion of the mark-to-market effect of the cash ﬂow hedge instrument is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to
income in the same period or periods that the underlying commodity purchase affects income. The net loss from commodity
hedges included in AOCL at December 31, 2016 was $99 million after tax ($180 million after tax loss at December 31, 2015).
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there was no material impact on the consolidated financial statements due to commodity hedge
ineffectiveness. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had the following gross aggregate notionals of outstanding
commodity forward, options and futures contracts to hedge forecasted purchases:
Dec 31, Dec 31,
Commodity 2016 2015 Notional Volume Unit
| Corn 0.4 1.0 million bushels 1
Crude Oil 0.6 0.4 million barrels
l Ethane 3.6 ; million barrels ‘
Natural Gas 78.6 257.4 million British thermal units
l Propane 1.5 ; million barrels ‘
,Soybeans T 7 1.4 million bushels 7
The net after-tax amounts to be reclassified from AOCL to income within the next 12 months are a $14 million gain for
commodity contracts, a $22 million gain for foreign currency contracts and a $2 million loss for interest rate contracts.
Fair Value Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the
offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current period income and reﬂected
as “Interest expense and amortization of debt discount” in the consolidated statements of income. The short-cut method is used
when the criteria are met. During 2015, the Company entered into and subsequently terminated an interest rate swap designated
as a fair value hedge of an underlying fixed rate debt obligation with a maturity date of May 2019. The fair value adjustment
resulting from this swap was a gain on the derivative of less than $1 million. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company
had no open interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate debt obligations.
Net Foreign Investment Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net foreign investment hedges, the effective portion of the gain or
loss on the derivative is included in “Cumulative Translation Adjustments” in AOCL. The Company had open foreign currency
contracts designated as net foreign investment hedges with a gross notional US. dollar equivalent of $2,641 million at
December 31, 2016 (zero at December 31, 2015). In addition, at December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding foreign-
currency denominated debt designated as a hedge of net foreign investment of $172 million ($166 million at December 31,
2015). The results of hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations included in “Cumulative Translation
Adjustments” in AOCL was a net gain of $1 million after tax for the period ended December 31, 2016 (net gain of $1 million
after tax for the period ended December 31, 2015). In 2016, 2015 and 2014 there was no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements due to hedge ineﬁectiveness. See Note 24 for further detail on changes in AOCL.
0th er Derivative Instruments
The Company utilizes futures, options and swap instruments that are effective as economic hedges of commodity price
exposures, but do not meet hedge accounting criteria for derivatives and hedging. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company had the following gross aggregate notionals of outstanding commodity contracts:
Dec 31, Dec 31,
