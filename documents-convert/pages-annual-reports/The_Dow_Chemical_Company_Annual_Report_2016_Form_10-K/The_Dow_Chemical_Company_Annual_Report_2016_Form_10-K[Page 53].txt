acetate monomers and acrylic monomers. In Energy & Water Solutions, volume declines in North American energy exploration
and fracturing market sectors and slow global demand for ion exchange resins used in industrial water applications more than
offset strong demand for reverse osmosis technologies.
EBITDA for 2015 was $1,021 million, compared with $817 million in 2014. EBITDA for 2015 was negatively impacted by
$101 million of certain items, as previously discussed. EBITDA for 2014 included a $500 million loss related to Dow
Corning’s abandonment of a polycrystalline silicon plant expansion in Clarksville, Tennessee, and a $252 million gain related
to Dow Corning’s adjustment of its implant liability. EBITDA for 2014 was also impacted by a $100 million charge for a
warranty accrual adjustment related to an exited business. See Notes 9, 12 and 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information on these certain items. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA decreased in 2015 as lower selling prices
and lower equity earnings from Dow Corning more than offset lower propylene and other raw material costs, the favorable
impact of currency on costs, lower operating costs and higher sales volume.
Infrastructure Solutions Outlook for 2017
Infrastructure Solutions sales are expected to grow in 2017, primarily due to volume growth from a full year of sales from
Infrastructure Solutions - Silicones. Dow Building & Construction sales are expected to increase primarily due to higher
demand in North America across residential and non-residential construction end markets, driven by cellulosics- and acrylics-
based products. Dow Coating Materials expects strong sales and volume growth driven by commercialization of new
technologies in both architectural and industrial coatings with growth in economy paints and new market segments. Energy &
Water Solutions expects demand to increase in both energy and water market sectors as oil prices stabilize. Growth is also
expected for reverse osmosis membrane technology due to increased capacity and increasing demand in emerging economies
and the energy and industrial sectors. Performance Monomers sales are expected to be higher due to price increases driven by
higher raw material costs partially oﬁset by a decline in sales volume due to increased internal consumption. Infrastructure
Solutions - Silicones expects selling prices to increase across all geographic areas for commodity silicone products in response
to higher raw material costs.
