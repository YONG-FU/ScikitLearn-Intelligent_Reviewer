2015 Versus 2014
Sales for Corporate were $294 million in 2015, down slightly from $309 million in 2014.
EBITDA for 2015 was a loss of $1,053 million, compared with a loss of $580 million in 2014. EBITDA for 2015 was
negatively impacted by $689 million of certain items, as previously discussed. EBITDA for 2014 was impacted by $49 million
of costs associated with transactions and productivity actions and a $78 million charge related to an increase in the asbestos-
related liability. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA improved in 2015 as gains related to Ventures and asset sales more
than offset an increase in performance-based compensation costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $6,607 million at December 31, 2016 and $8,577 million at December 31,
2015, of which $4,890 million at December 31, 2016 and $6,494 million at December 31, 2015 was held by subsidiaries in
foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion
regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the
United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries'
operational activities and future foreign investments. A deferred taX liability has been accrued for the funds that are available to
be repatriated to the United States. At December 31, 2016, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the
United States. However, in the unusual event that additional foreign funds are needed in the United States, the Company has the
ability to repatriate additional funds. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the taX liability after considering available
foreign taX credits and other taX attributes. It is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred taX liability on
undistributed foreign earnings.
The Company’s cash ﬂows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reﬂected in the consolidated statements of cash
ﬂows, are summarized in the following table:

Cash F lows from Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to cash payments related to the
settlement of the urethane matters class action lawsuit and opt-out cases, increased costs associated with transactions and
productivity actions, a cash payment related to the settlement of an uncertain taX position and a one-time payment related to the
termination of a terminal use agreement. Cash provided by operating activities increased in 2015 compared with 2014,
primarily due to improvements in working capital and increased earnings.
