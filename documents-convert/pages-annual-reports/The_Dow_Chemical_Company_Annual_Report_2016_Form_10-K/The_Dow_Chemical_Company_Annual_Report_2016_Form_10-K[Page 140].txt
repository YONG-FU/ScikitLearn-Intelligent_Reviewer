For pension plan assets classified as Level 1 measurements (measured using quoted prices in active markets), total fair value is
either the price of the most recent trade at the time of the market close or the official close price, as defined by the exchange on
which the asset is most actively traded on the last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of units held without
consideration of transaction costs.
For pension plan assets classified as Level 2 measurements, where the security is frequently traded in less active markets, fair
value is based on the closing price at the end of the period; where the security is less frequently traded, fair value is based on
the price a dealer would pay for the security or similar securities, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. Market
inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks.
For derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial
instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates,
interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. For other pension plan assets for which observable
inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other
standard pricing models.
For pension plan assets classified as Level 3 measurements, total fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs
including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. Investment managers or fund managers
provide valuations of the investment on a monthly or quarterly basis. These valuations are reviewed for reasonableness based
on applicable sector, benchmark and company performance. Adjustments to valuations are made where appropriate. Where
available, audited financial statements are obtained and reviewed for the investments as support for the manager’s investment
