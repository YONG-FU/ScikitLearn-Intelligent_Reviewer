In addition to the US. qualified defined benefit pension plan, U.S. employees may participate in defined contribution plans
(Employee Savings Plans or 401(k) plans) by contributing a portion of their compensation, which is partially matched by the
Company. Defined contribution plans also cover employees in some subsidiaries in other countries, including Australia, Brazil,
Canada, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Expense recognized for all defined contribution plans was $283 million in 2016,
$235 million in 2015 and $243 million in 2014.
Other Postretirement Beneﬁts
The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees. The Company’s plans outside of the
United States are not significant; therefore, this discussion relates to the US. plans only. The plans provide health care benefits,
including hospital, physicians’ services, drug and major medical expense coverage, and life insurance benefits. In general, for
employees hired before January 1, 1993, the plans provide benefits supplemental to Medicare when retirees are eligible for
these benefits. The Company and the retiree share the cost of these benefits, with the Company portion increasing as the retiree
has increased years of credited service, although there is a cap on the Company portion. The Company has the ability to change
these benefits at any time. Employees hired after January 1, 2008, are not covered under the plans.
On January 1, 2014, the Company implemented an Employer Group Waiver Plan (“EGWP”) for its Medicare-eligible, retiree
medical plan participants. The Medicare Part D Retiree Drug Subsidy program (“RDS”) was eliminated on January 1, 2014.
The EGWP does not significantly alter the benefits provided to retiree medical plan participants. Federal subsidies to be earned
under the EGWP are expected to exceed those earned under the RDS and will be partially offset by increased costs related to
the administration of the EGWP. The net periodic benefit cost decreased by $25 million in 2014 due to the EGWP.
The Company funds most of the cost of these health care and life insurance benefits as incurred. In 2016, Dow did not make
any contributions to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts. The trusts did not hold assets at December 31, 2016. Dow does
not expect to contribute assets to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts in 2017.

Increasing the assumed medical cost trend rate for all plans by one percentage point in each year would decrease the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2016, by $7 million and decrease the net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for the year by $1 million. Decreasing the assumed medical cost trend rate for all plans by one percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2016, by $11 million and the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year by $1 million.
