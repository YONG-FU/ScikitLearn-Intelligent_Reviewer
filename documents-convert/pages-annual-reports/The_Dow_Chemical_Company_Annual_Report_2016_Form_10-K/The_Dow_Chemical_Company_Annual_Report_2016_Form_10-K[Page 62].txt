See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the Company’s notes payable and long-term
debt activity.
Dow’s public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary
restrictive covenant and default provisions. The Company’s most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position
is the obligation to maintain the ratio of the Company’s consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater
than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of the Company’s consolidated indebtedness to
consolidated capitalization as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.42 to 1.00 at December 31, 2016. Management
believes the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at December 31, 2016. For
information on Dow’s covenants and default provisions, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Management expects that the Company will continue to have suﬁicient liquidity and financial ﬂexibility to meet all of its
business obligations.
