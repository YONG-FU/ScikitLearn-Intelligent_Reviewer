(1) Drawn on May 31, 2016, by Dow Corning, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as of June 1, 2016.
In connection with the DCC Transaction, on May 31, 2016, Dow Corning incurred $4.5 billion of indebtedness under a certain
third party credit agreement ("DCC Term Loan Facility") in order to fund the contribution of cash to Splitco. Subsequent to the
DCC Transaction, the Company guaranteed the obligations of Dow Corning under the DCC Term Loan Facility and, as a result,
the covenants and events of default applicable to the DCC Term Loan Facility are substantially similar to the covenants and
events of default set forth in the Company's Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts borrowed
under the DCC Term Loan Facility are repayable on May 30, 2017, subject to a 364-day extension option, at Dow Corning's
election, upon the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent. Dow Corning intends to exercise the 364-day
extension option on the DCC Term Loan Facility. See Note 4 for additional information on the DCC Transaction.
Accounts Receivable Securitizatiori Facilities
The Company has access to committed accounts receivable securitization facilities in the United States, Europe and Japan, from
which amounts available for funding are based upon available and eligible accounts receivable within each of the facilities. The
Japan facilities are renewed annually. The Europe facility was renewed in July 2015 for a term that extends to July 2018. The
Company renewed the United States facility in June 2015 for a term that extends to June 2018. See Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.
Debt
As Dow continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial ﬂexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non—
GAAP financial measure), as Dow believes this is the best representation of the Company’s financial leverage at this point in
time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus "Cash and cash equivalents." At December 31,
2016, net debt as a percent of total capitalization increased to 35.1 percent. This increase was primarily due to debt assumed in
the DCC Transaction and a nearly $2 billion decrease in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the DCC Transaction.
