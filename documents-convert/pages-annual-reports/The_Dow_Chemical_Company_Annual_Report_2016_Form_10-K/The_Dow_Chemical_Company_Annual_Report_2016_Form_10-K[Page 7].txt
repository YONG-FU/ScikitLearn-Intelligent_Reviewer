BOARD (‘33 DI CTORS
At Dow, we believe an active, well—informed and independent Board of Directors is necessary to oversee and
ensure the long-term interests of our stakeholders. Our Board, composed of leaders with diverse experience and
skills, is highly engaged in the strategic planning process. The Board regularly reviews and assesses the results
of Dow’s operations, financial performance, prospects and competitive positions, and evaluates strategic options
regarding Dow’s market participation and business portfolio structure. Serving at the discretion of shareholders,
our Board members also focus on guiding leadership development, compensation and compliance matters.
