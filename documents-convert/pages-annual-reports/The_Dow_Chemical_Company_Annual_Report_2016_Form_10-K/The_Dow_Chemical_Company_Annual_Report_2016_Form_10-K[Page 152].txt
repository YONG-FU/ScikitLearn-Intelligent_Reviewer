Gross operating loss carryforwards amounted to $10,580 million at December 31, 2016 and $10,364 million at December 31,
2015. At December 31, 2016, $1,922 million of the operating loss carryforwards were subject to expiration in 2017 through
2021. The remaining operating loss carryforwards expire in years beyond 2021 or have an indefinite carryforward period. Tax
credit carryforwards at December 31, 2016 amounted to $928 million ($128 million at December 31, 2015), net of uncertain
tax positions. The increase in tax credit carryforwards in 2016 was primarily due to reduced domestic income which limited the
utilization of tax credits. Tax credit carryforwards of $28 million are subject to expiration in 2017 through 2021 and the
remaining expire in years beyond 2021 or have an indefinite carryforward period.
The Company had valuation allowances that primarily related to the realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss
carryforwards from operations in the United States, Brazil and Asia Pacific of $1,061 million at December 31, 2016 and
$1,000 million at December 31, 2015.
Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies that are deemed to be permanently invested amounted to
$18,668 million at December 31, 2016, $18,773 million at December 31, 2015 and $18,037 million at December 31, 2014. It is
not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, a settlement of $206 million was reached on a tax matter associated with a historical change in
the legal ownership structure of a nonconsolidated affiliate. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded a net decrease
in uncertain tax positions of $67 million, included in “Other noncurrent obligations” in the consolidated balance sheets, and an
unfavorable impact of $13 million to “Provision for income taxes” in the consolidated statements of income. The following
table provides a reconciliation of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits:

nonconsolidated affiliate.
(2) Includes $126 million assumed in the DCC Transaction.

was $223 million ($206 million at December 31, 2015).
