Dow shareholders who elected to participate in the public exchange offer tendered 34.1 million shares of Dow common stock
in exchange for 100 million shares of Splitco. Following the merger of Splitco with Olin, each share of Splitco common stock
was automatically converted to the right to receive 0.87482759 shares of Olin common stock, or 87.5 million shares, which
represented approximately 52.7 percent of Olin’s common stock outstanding. As a result of this non-cash share exchange offer,
the Company recorded an increase of $1,523 million in “Treasury stock at cost” in the consolidated balance sheets, which is
valued based on Dow’s opening stock price on October 5, 2015. The Company’s outstanding common shares were reduced by
3 percent as a result of the Transaction.
Under the terms of the Transaction, Dow received cash proceeds of $875 million in the form of a one-time special payment
from Splitco from proceeds received from a term loan and included in "Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt" in the
consolidated statements of cash ﬂows. The Company also received a $434 million advance payment from Olin, included in
"Other assets and liabilities" in the consolidated statements of cash ﬂows, related to a long-term ethylene supply agreement, of
which $16 million was classified as "Accrued and other current liabilities" and $418 million was classified as "Other
noncurrent obligations" in the consolidated balance sheets at the time of receipt. The Transaction also resulted in numerous
long-term supply, service and purchase agreements between Dow and Olin.
In connection with the Transaction, the Company purchased Mitsui & Co. Texas Chlor—Alkali Inc. ’3 (“Mitsui”) 50 percent
equity interest in a membrane chlor—alkali joint venture (“JV Entity”), which resulted in Dow becoming the sole equity owner
of the JV Entity. The Company purchased Mitsui's equity interest for $133 million, which resulted in a loss of $25 million
included in "Sundry income (expense) - net" in the consolidated statements of income and included as a component of the
pretax gain on the Transaction. The JV Entity was included in the transfer of the chlorine value chain to Splitco. See Note 20
for further information on the acquisition of Mitsui’s equity interest in the JV Entity.
The Company also transferred $439 million of net unfunded defined pension and other postretirement benefit obligations in the
United States and Germany to Olin. See Note 18 for further details.
