option to extend the DCC Term Loan facility will be exercised.
(2) Deferred income tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws, tax rates and the operating results of the Company. As a result,
it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year. All noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities
have been reﬂected in “2022 and beyond.”

defense strategies, changes in state and national law, and claims filing and resolution rates.
(4) Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities, the Company is
unable to determine the timing of payments related to its uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. Amounts beyond the
current year are therefore reﬂected in “2022 and beyond.”
(5) Includes outstanding purchase orders and other commitments greater than $1 million, obtained through a survey conducted within the
Com an .
(6) Cashrieqlliirements for interest on long-term debt was calculated using current interest rates at December 31, 2016, and includes
approximately $4,968 million of various ﬂoating rate notes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions,
agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the
equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required
to consolidate the entities (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 16 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets.
Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated aﬁiliates when
the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. The Company
had outstanding guarantees at December 31, 2016 of $6,043 million, compared with $5,822 million at December 31, 2015.
Additional information related to these guarantees can be found in the “Guarantees” section of Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Fair Value Measurements
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; see Note 12
for additional information concerning fair value measurements, including the Company’s interests held in trade receivable
conduits; and, see Note 18 for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan
assets.
