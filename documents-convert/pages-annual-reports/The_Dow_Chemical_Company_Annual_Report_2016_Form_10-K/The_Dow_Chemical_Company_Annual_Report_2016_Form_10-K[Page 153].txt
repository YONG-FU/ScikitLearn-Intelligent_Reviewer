Interest and penalties are recognized as components of the “Provision for income taxes,” and totaled a benefit of $55 million in
2016, a charge of $80 million in 2015 and a charge of $15 million in 2014. The Company’s accrual for interest and penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions was $59 million at December 31, 2016 and $159 million at December 31, 2015.
On January 9, 2017, the US. Supreme Court denied ceriiorari in the Company’s tax treatment of partnerships and transactions
associated with Chemtech, a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company has fully accrued the position and does not expect a
future impact to “Provision for income taxes” in the consolidated statements of income as a result of the ruling.

The Company is currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that some of these
examinations may be resolved within twelve months. As a result, it is reasonably possible that the total gross unrecognized tax
benefits of the Company at December 31, 2016, may range from an increase of $10 million to a decrease of $61 million in the
next twelve months as a result of these resolved examinations. The impact on the Company’s results of operations is not
expected to be material.
The reserve for non-income tax contingencies related to issues in the United States and foreign locations was $108 million at
December 31, 2016 and $64 million at December 31, 2015. This is management’s best estimate of the potential liability for
non-income tax contingencies. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law, both
legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions” tax court systems. It is the opinion of the Company’s management
that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.
