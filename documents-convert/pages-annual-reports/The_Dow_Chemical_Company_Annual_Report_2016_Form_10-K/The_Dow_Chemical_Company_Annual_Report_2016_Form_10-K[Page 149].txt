Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The Company has the Dow Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”), which is an integral part of The Dow Chemical
Company Employees” Savings Plan (the “Plan”). A significant majority of full-time employees in the United States are eligible
to participate in the Plan. The Company uses the ESOP to provide the Company’s matching contribution in the form of the
Company’s stock to Plan participants.
In connection with the acquisition of Rohm and Haas on April 1, 2009, the Rohm and Haas Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(the "Rohm and Haas ESOP") was merged into the Plan, and the Company assumed the $78 million balance of debt at
9.8 percent interest with final maturity in 2020 that was used to finance share purchases by the Rohm and Haas ESOP in 1990.
The outstanding balance of the debt was $24 million at December 31, 2016 and $30 million at December 31, 2015.
Dividends on unallocated shares held by the ESOP are used by the ESOP to make debt service payments and to purchase
additional shares if dividends exceed the debt service payments. Dividends on allocated shares are used by the ESOP to make
debt service payments to the extent needed; otherwise, they are paid to the Plan participants. Shares are released for allocation
to participants based on the ratio of the current year’s debt service to the sum of the principal and interest payments over the
life of the loan. The shares are allocated to Plan participants in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
Compensation expense for allocated shares is recorded at the fair value of the shares on the date of allocation. ESOP shares that
have not been released or committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing basic and diluted
earnings per share.
Compensation expense for ESOP shares was $192 million in 2016, $174 million in 2015 and $163 million in 2014. At
December 31, 2016, 15.8 million shares out of a total 29.3 million shares held by the ESOP had been allocated to participants”
accounts; 1.9 million shares were released but unallocated; and 11.6 million shares, at a fair value of $661 million, were
considered unearned.
