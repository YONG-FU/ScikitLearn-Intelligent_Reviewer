the actual costs for Dow Corning to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. Any such events could result in
an increase or decrease in the recorded liability.
0th er Litigation Matters
In addition to the specific matters described above, the Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits arising out
of the normal course of business with respect to product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax
and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation and other actions. Certain of these actions purport to be class actions
and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are being contested. Dow has an active risk management program
consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times. These policies may provide coverage
that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies described above. It is the opinion of the
Company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such other claims and lawsuits will have a
material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and cash ﬂows of the Company.

Guarantees
Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates when
