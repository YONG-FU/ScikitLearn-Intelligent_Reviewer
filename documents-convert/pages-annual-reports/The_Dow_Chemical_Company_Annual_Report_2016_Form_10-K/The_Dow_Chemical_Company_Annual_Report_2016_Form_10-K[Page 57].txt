Current and Future Investments
The Company has a number of investments in the US. Gulf Coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of low-cost natural
gas and natural gas liquids derived from shale gas including: construction of a new on-purpose propylene production facility,
which commenced operations in December 2015; completion of a major maintenance turnaround in December 2016 at an
ethylene production facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which included expanding the facility's ethylene production capacity by
up to 250 KTA and modifications to enable full ethane cracking ﬂexibility; and construction of a new world-scale ethylene
production facility in Freeport, Texas, which is expected to start up in mid-2017. As a result of these investments, the
Company's exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline, oﬁset by increased exposure to ethane and
propane feedstocks. Dow’s ethylene production capabilities are expected to increase by as much as 20 percent.
In 2016, the Company completed an expansion of a gas-phase polyethylene production facility in Seadrift, Texas. Expansion
projects are also currently underway at two of the Company's gas-phase polyethylene units in St. Charles, Louisiana, with
expected start-up in mid-2018. The Company is also building four new production facilities on the US. Gulf Coast to leverage
an advantaged feedstock position to support profitable growth of the Company's high value Performance Plastics franchise
which include an ELITETM Polymer production facility, a Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) production facility and a
NORDELTM Metallocene EPDM production facility, which are all expected to start up in 2017, and a High Melt Index (HMI)
AFFINITYTM Polymer production facility, which is expected to start up in the second half of 20 1 8.

2016 Versus 2015
Sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to insurance operations, were $279 million in 2016, down from $294 million in
20 1 5.
EBITDA for 2016 was a loss of $2,563 million, compared with a loss of $1,053 million in 2015. EBITDA for 2016 was
impacted by a $1,009 million charge due to a change in accounting policy for asbestos-related defense and processing costs,
and a $104 million charge to increase the asbestos—related liability for pending and future claims, which both reﬂect estimates
through the terminal year of 2049. EBITDA was also impacted by $544 million of costs associated with transactions and
productivity actions, $314 million of restructuring charges and $290 million of charges for environmental matters. EBITDA for
2015 was impacted by $294 million of restructuring charges, $194 million of costs associated with transactions and
productivity actions, a $98 million loss related to the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, a $68 million loss on the early
extinguishment of debt related to the split-off of the Company's chlorine value chain, a loss recognized by Sadara related to the
write-off of design engineering work for an Epoxy plant of which Dow's share was $27 million, and an $8 million loss related
to the early extinguishment of debt. Excluding these certain items, EBITDA improved in 2016 as increased gains related to
Ventures, lower asbestos-related defense costs resulting from the change in accounting policy and lower performance-based
compensation costs more than offset higher foreign exchange losses. See Notes 1, 3, 6, 13, 15 and 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on these matters.
In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for Union Carbide's asbestos-related
defense and processing costs from expensing as incurred to estimating and accruing a liability. The Company’s total asbestos—
related liability, including defense and processing costs, was $1,490 million at December 31, 2016. Future defense and
resolution costs will be applied against this liability.
