NOTE 1 — SUMIVIARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of The Dow Chemical Company and its subsidiaries (“Dow” or the
“Company”) were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company
exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary
beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates
(20-50 percent owned companies, joint ventures and partnerships) are accounted for using the equity method.
Adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation
of Deferred Taxes" and Other Prior Year Balance Sheet and Footnote Changes
In the first quarter of 20 16, the Company early adopted ASU 2015-17. The Company elected to apply the new guidance on a
retrospective basis and, as a result, changes have been made to the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015. See Note 2 for additional information. A change was also made to the
prior year consolidated balance sheets to reclassify prepaid tax assets of $293 million to "Other current assets." In addition, a
change was made to the prior year consolidated balance sheets to reclassify $51 million from "Asbestos-related insurance
receivables - noncurrent" to "Noncurrent receivables." The change was made to conform with current year presentation. A
summary of the changes made to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2015, is included in the table that follows.
