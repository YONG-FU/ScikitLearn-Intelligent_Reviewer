Our unsecured senior revolving credit facility provides for borrowings up to $575.0 million through 2020 and is subject to
certain commitment fees. This credit facility has sub-limits for the issuance of letters of credit, swingline borrowings and
foreign currency denominated borrowings; and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital,
permitted acquisitions, capital expenditures and repayment of existing indebtedness. Loans under the revolving facility will
bear interest, at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the federal funds rate, at the Company's option. Our weighted average
interest rate was 2.27% in 2016. At December 31, 2016, $377.2 million of the $575.0 million senior revolving credit facility
was unused, including letters of credit.
The Company currently has access to approximately $572.2 million of capital at December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 11
Short and Long— Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Operating activities. Operating activities provided cash of $134.9 million in 2016, compared to providing cash of $55.3
million in 2015. The increase in operating cash ﬂow during 2016 was primarily attributable to higher net income and lower
working capital driven by collections of accounts receivable and our ongoing focus on inventory management. Working capital
as a percentage of sales improved by 400 bps to 21.7% in 2016 as compared to 25.7% in 2015. At December 31, 2016, working
capital included trade receivables, inventory and accounts payable of $1.1 million, $3.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively
related to the acquisition of Senscient.
Operating activities provided cash of $55.3 million in 2015, compared to providing cash of $107.0 million in 2014. Lower
operating cash ﬂow in 2015 is primarily related to lower profitability in 2015 and changes in working capital. Trade receivables
were $232.9 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $211.4 million at December 31, 2014, reﬂecting strong G1 SCBA sales
results in the 2015 fourth quarter partially offset by a decrease due to currency translation effects. Inventories were $125.8
million at December 31, 2015 increased $2.8 million as compared to $123.0 million at December 31, 2014 due to the
acquisition of Latchways and continued demand planning for our G1 SCBA. Currency translation effects of $16.4 million
decreased inventories. Accounts payable were $68.2 million at December 31, 2015 compared to $70.2 million at December 31,
2014 primarily due to a decrease for currency translation effects. The December 31, 2015 trade receivables and inventory
balances included Latchways trade receivables and inventory of$11.8 million and $9.1 million, respectively.
Investing activities. Investing activities used cash of $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to
using $208.5 million in 2015. The acquisition of Senscient drove cash outﬂows from investing activities during 2016 while the
acquisition of Latchways drove cash outﬂows from investing activities during 2015. Capital expenditures were $25.5 million in
2016 compared to $36.2 million in 2015. Capital expenditures in 2015 included spending related to initiatives such as the G1
SCBA and our European reorganization. We plan to invest approximately $30.0 million in capital expenditures in 2017.
Investing activities used cash of $208.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to using $30.7 million
in 2014. The increased use of cash for investing activities in 2015 was related to the acquisition of Latchways. Cash generated
from property disposals was $8.0 million in 2015 compared to $3.4 million in 2014. The cash received from property disposals
in 2015 include proceeds from the sale of property in Australia. Capital expenditures were $36.2 million compared to $33.6
million in 2014.
Financing activities. Financing activities used cash of $97.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to
providing cash of $164.9 million in 2015. During 2016, we had net payments on debt of $60.9 million. This compared to net
proceeds from borrowings of $218.9 million in the same period in 2015 primarily related to the ﬁnancing of the Latchways
acquisition.
We made dividend payments of $49.1 million during 2016, compared to $47.4 million million during 2015. Dividends
paid on our common stock during 2016 were $1.31 per share. Dividends paid on our common stock in 2015 and 2014 were
$1.27 and $1.23 per share, respectively.
Restricted cash balances were $1.2 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $2.4 million at December 31, 2015 and
were primarily used to support letter of credit balances.
During 2015, the MSA Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $100.0 million in shares of MSA
common stock and we executed share repurchases of $7.1 million. There were no share repurchases in 2016. The program
seeks to offset equity dilution associated with employee stock compensation. The Board of Directors did not set a time
limitation on the repurchase program.
Financing activities provided cash of $164.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to using cash of
$58.1 million in 2014. The change was primarily related to borrowings made to finance the acquisition of Latchways in 2015.
