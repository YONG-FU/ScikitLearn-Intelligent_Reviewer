Note 10—Stock Plans
The 2016 Management Equity Incentive Plan provides for various forms of stock-based compensation for eligible key
employees through May 2026. Management stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and performance stock units. The 2008 Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock
options and restricted stock to non-employee directors through May 2018. Stock options are granted at market prices and expire
after ten years. Stock options are exercisable beginning three years after the grant date. Restricted stock and restricted stock
units are granted without payment to the Company and generally vest three years after the grant date. Restricted stock and
restricted stock units are valued at the market value of the stock on the grant date. Performance stock units with a market
condition are valued at an estimated fair value using the Monte Carlo model. The final number of shares to be issued for
performance stock units may range from zero to 200% of the target award based on achieving the specified performance targets
over the performance period. In general, unvested stock options, restricted stock and performance stock units are forfeited if the
participant’s employment with the Company terminates for any reason other than retirement, death or disability. We issue
Treasury shares for stock option exercises and grants of restricted stock and performance stock. Please refer to Note 6 for
further information regarding stock compensation share issuance. As of December 31, 2016, there were 1,368,638 and 139,657
shares, respectively, reserved for future grants under the management and non-employee directors’ equity incentive plans.

We did not capitalize any stock-based compensation expense, and all expense is recorded in SG&A expense in 2016,
2015, or 2014.
Stock option expense is based on the fair value of stock option grants estimated on the grant dates using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions for options granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
2016 2015 2014
[Fair value per option $ 11.69 $ 15.63 $ 17.26 [
Risk-free interest rate 1.6% 1.8% 21%
[Expected dividend yield 2.8% 2.3% 2.4%]
Expected volatility 34% 39% 41%
[Expected life (years) 70 6,7 6,6[
The risk-free interest rate is based on the US. Treasury Constant Maturity rates as of the grant date converted into an
implied spot rate yield curve. Expected dividend yield is based on the most recent annualized dividend divided by the one year
average closing share price. Expected volatility is based on the ten year historical volatility using daily stock prices. Expected
life is based on historical stock option exercise data.
