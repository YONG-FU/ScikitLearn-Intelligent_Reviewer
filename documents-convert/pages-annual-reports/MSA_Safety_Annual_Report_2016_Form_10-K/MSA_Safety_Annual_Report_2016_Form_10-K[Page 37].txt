CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS
The year-end position of the US. dollar relative to international currencies resulted in a translation loss of $25.9 million
being recorded to cumulative translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016. This compares to losses of $47.7
million in 2015 and $40.0 million in 2014. The translation loss in 2016 was primarily related to the strengthening of the US
dollar against the British pound, Mexican peso, Argentine peso, euro, and Brazilian real. The translation loss in 2015 was
primarily related to the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro, British pound, Brazilian real, and South African rand.
The translation loss in 2014 was primarily related to the weakening of the euro, Mexican peso, Argentine peso, and the South
African rand.

The significant obligations table does not include obligations to taxing authorities due to uncertainty surrounding the
ultimate settlement of amounts and timing of these obligations.
We expect to meet our 2017, 2018 and 2019 debt service obligations through cash provided by operations. Approximately
$191.0 million of debt payable in 2020 relates to our unsecured senior revolving credit facility. We expect to generate sufficient
operating cash ﬂow to make payments against this amount each year. To the extent that a balance remains when the facility
matures in 2020, we expect to refinance the remaining balance through new borrowing facilities. Interest expense on fixed rate
debt over the next five years is expected to be approximately $8.1 million in 2017, $6.9 million in 2018, $5.8 million in 2019,
$4.6 million in 2020, and $3.6 million in 2021.
The Company had outstanding bank guarantees and standby letters of credit with banks as of December 31, 2016 totaling
$13.1 million, of which $6.9 million relate to the senior revolving credit facility. These letters of credit serve to cover customer
requirements in connection with certain sales orders and insurance companies. No amounts were drawn on these arrangements
at December 31, 2016. The Company is also required to provide cash collateral in connection with certain arrangements. At
December 31, 2016, the Company has $1.2 million of restricted cash in support of these arrangements.
We expect to make net contributions of $5.9 million to our pension plans in 2017 which are primarily associated with our
International segment. We have not been required to make contributions to our US based qualified defined benefit pension
plan in many years.
We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of our ordinary
conduct of business.
