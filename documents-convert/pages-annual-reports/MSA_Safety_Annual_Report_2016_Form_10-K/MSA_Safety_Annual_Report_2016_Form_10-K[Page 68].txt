At December 31, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $37.2 million, all of which are in non-
U.S. tax jurisdictions. Net operating loss carryforwards without a valuation allowance of $0.1 million will expire in 2017. The
remainder either have a valuation allowance or may be carried forward for a period of at least six years. The change in
valuation allowance for the year of $0.2 million is primarily due to our inability to recognize deferred tax assets on certain
foreign entities that continue to generate losses.
No deferred US. income taxes have been provided on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which amounted
to $422.3 million as of December 31, 2016. These earnings are considered to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time.
Because we currently do not have any plans to repatriate these funds, we cannot determine the impact of local taxes,
withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and, therefore, cannot
reasonably estimate the associated tax liability. In cases where we intend to repatriate a portion of the undistributed earnings of
our foreign subsidiaries, we provide US. income taxes on such earnings.
A reconciliation of the change in the tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015 is as follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce our future effective tax rate. We have
recognized tax benefits associated with these liabilities in the amount of $4.3 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2016
and 2015, respectively.
