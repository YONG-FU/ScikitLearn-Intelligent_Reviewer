Note 14—Pensions and Other Post-retirement Beneﬁts
We maintain various deﬁned benefit and defined contribution plans covering the majority of our employees. Our principal
U.S. plan is funded in compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It is our general policy to fund
current costs for the international plans, except in Germany and Mexico, where it is common practice and permissible under tax
laws to accrue book reserves.
We provide health care benefits and limited life insurance for certain retired employees who are covered by our principal
U.S. deﬁned benefit pension plan until they become Medicare-eligible.
