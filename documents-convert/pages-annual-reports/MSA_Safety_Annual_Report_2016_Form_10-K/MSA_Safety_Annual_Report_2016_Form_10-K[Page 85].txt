Additions to insurance receivables in the above table represent insured cumulative trauma product liability losses and
related defense costs. Collections and settlements primarily represent agreements with insurance companies to pay amounts due
that are applicable to cumulative trauma claims. When there are contingencies embedded in these agreements, we apply
payments to the undiscounted receivable in the period when the contingency is met.
In some cases, settlements are converted to formal notes receivable from insurance companies. The notes receivable are
recorded as a transfer from the insurance receivable balance to the note receivable, insurance companies (current and
noncurrent) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In cases where the payment stream covers multiple years and there are no
contingencies, the present value of the payments is recorded as a transfer from the insurance receivable balance to the note
receivable, insurance companies (current and long-term) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Provided the remaining insurance
receivable is recoverable through the insurance carriers, no gain or loss is recognized at the time of transfer from insurance
receivable to notes receivable from insurance companies.
Notes receivable from insurance companies at December 31, 2016 totaled $67.3 million, of which $4.2 million is reported
in Notes receivable, insurance companies, current and $63.1 million is reported in Notes receivable, insurance companies,
noncurrent. Notes receivable from insurance companies at December 31, 2015 totaled $8.7 million, of which $6.7 million is
reported in Notes receivable, insurance companies, current and $2 million is reported in Notes receivable, insurance companies,
noncurrent.

The collectibility of MSA LLC's insurance receivables is regularly evaluated and we believe that the amounts recorded are
probable of collection. These determinations are based on analysis of the terms of the underlying insurance policies, experience
in successfully recovering cumulative trauma product liability claims ﬁom our insurers under other policies, the financial
ability of the insurance carriers to pay the claims, understanding and interpretation of the relevant facts and applicable law and
the advice of MSA LLC's outside legal counsel. We believe that successful resolution of insurance litigation with various
insurance carriers over the years, as well as the recent trial verdict against North River, which resulted in a favorable outcome,
demonstrate that we have strong legal positions concerning MSA LLC's rights to coverage. The trial verdict is described below
Uninsured cumulative trauma product liability losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were
$0.3 million, $1.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
Insurance Litigation
MSA LLC is currently involved in insurance coverage litigation with a number of its insurance carriers regarding its
Occurrence-Based Policies.

United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging that North River breached one of its insurance
