None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Form lO-K, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules l3a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the principal executive officer and principle financial officer, as apprOpriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Management has excluded Senscient from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2016 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination late in the third quarter of 2016. Senscient is
wholly-owned by MSA.
(b) Changes in internal control. There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—“Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting” and “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”
