Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of MSA Safety Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in retained earnings and
accumulated other comprehensive loss and of cash ﬂows for the year ended December 31, 2014 present fairly, in all material
respects, the results of operations and cash ﬂows of MSA Safety Incorporated and its subsidiaries for the year ended December
31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 2014 listed in the index appearing under Item
15 (a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
