Note 17—Derivative Financial Instruments
As part of our currency exchange rate risk management strategy, we enter into certain derivative foreign currency forward
contracts that do not meet the US. GAAP criteria for hedge accounting, but which have the impact of partially offsetting certain
foreign currency exposures. We account for these forward contracts on a full mark-to-market basis and report the related gains
or losses in currency exchange losses (gains) in the consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2016, the notional
amount of open forward contracts was $75.3 million and the unrealized gain on these contracts was $0.3 million. All open
forward contracts will mature during the first quarter of 20 17.
The following table presents the balance sheet location and fair value of assets and liabilities associated with derivative
financial instruments.
