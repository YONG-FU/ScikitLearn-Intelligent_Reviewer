Our plans to improve future proﬁtability through restructuring programs may not be successful and may lead to
unintended consequences.
MSA incurred a significant amount of restructuring expense during 2015, primarily related to headcount reduction. In
2016, certain employees in the Americas segment were offered a voluntary retirement incentive package (“VRIP”). Non-cash
special termination benefit expense of approximately $11.5 million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2017
related to these elections. These efforts should contribute to proﬁtability in future periods. Our success will depend on our
ability to maintain increased productivity without backfilling certain positions.
We have signiﬁcant international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries.
We have business operations in over 40 foreign countries. In 2016, approximately half of our net sales were made by
operations located outside the United States. Our international operations are subject to various political, economic and other
risks and uncertainties, which could adversely affect our business. These risks include the following:
- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;
- changes in trade policy or tariff regulations;
- changes in tax laws and regulations;
- changes to the company's legal structure could have unintended tax consequences;
- inability to generate suﬂicient profit in certain foreign jurisdictions could lead to additional valuation allowances on
deferred tax assets;
- intellectual property protection difﬁculties;
- difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;
° complications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, some of which may conﬂict with US.
laws;
- trade protection measures and price controls;
- trade sanctions and embargoes;
- nationalization and expropriation;
- increased international instability or potential instability of foreign governments;
- effectiveness of worldwide compliance with MSA's anti-bribery policy, local laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act
- the ability to effectively negotiate with labor unions in foreign countries;
- the need to take extra security precautions for our international operations; and
° costs and difficulties in managing culturally and geographically diverse international operations.
Any one or more of these risks could have a negative impact on the success of our international operations and, thereby,
materially and adversely affect our business as a whole.
Our future results are subject to the risk that purchased components and materials are unavailable or available at
excessive cost due to material shortages, excessive demand, currency ﬂuctuation and other factors.
We depend on various components and materials to manufacture our products. Although we have not experienced any
difficulty in obtaining components and materials, it is possible that any of our supplier relationships could be terminated or
otherwise disrupted. Any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a materially adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully manage
price ﬂuctuations due to market demand, currency risks or material shortages, or that future price ﬂuctuations will not have a
materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and ﬁnancial condition.
