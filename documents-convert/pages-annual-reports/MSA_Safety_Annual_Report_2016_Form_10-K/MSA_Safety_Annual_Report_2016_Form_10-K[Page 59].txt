In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplzﬁ/ing the T est for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU simplifies the
accounting for goodwill impairments under Step 2 by eliminating the requirement to perform procedures to determine the fair
value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously unrecognized assets and liabilities, in order to
determine the fair value of the goodwill and any impairment charge to be recognized. Under this ASU, the impairment charge
to be recognized should be the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value as
calculated under Step 1 provided that the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit. This ASU is effective beginning in 2019 for public entities and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual
goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU may have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements in the event that we determine that goodwill for any of our reporting units is impaired.

employees who accepted the VRIP revoked their election to retire under the terms of the plan. Non-cash special termination
benefit expense of approximately $11.5 million is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2017 related to these elections.
