(Percent Change) Consolidated Continuing Operations
J GAAP reported change (2.9)% J
Currency translation effects (2.2)%
JConstant currency change (0.7 )% J
Acquisitions and related strategic transaction costs 2.4%
JOrganic constant currency change (3.1)% J
Note: Organic constant currency change is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure provided by the Company to give a better understanding of the
Company's underlying business performance. Organic constant currency change in selling, general, and administrative expenses is calculated
by removing the percentage impact from acquisitions and currency translation effects from the overall percentage change in GAAP selling,
general, and administrative expense. Management believes excluding acquisitions and currency translation effects provide investors with a
greater level of clarity into spending levels on a year-over-year basis.
Research and development expenses. Research and development expense was $46.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2016, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 3.7%, compared to $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Research and
development expense was 4.1% of net sales in 2016, compared to 4.3% of net sales in 2015 and we expect research and
development expense to range from 4.0% to 4.5% of sales for the year ending December 31, 2017 as we continue to develop
new products for global safety markets.
Restructuring and other charges. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded restructuring charges, net
of adjustments, of $5.7 million, primarily related to severance costs for staff reductions associated with ongoing initiatives to
right size our operations in Europe, Brazil, and Japan. This compared to charges of $ 12.3 million during the year ended
December 31, 2015, primarily related to severance costs associated with our global cost reduction program.
In September 2016, certain employees in the Americas segment were offered a voluntary retirement incentive package
(“VRIP”). The election window for participation closed on October 17, 2016. The employees were required to render service
through January 31, 2017 to receive the VRIP and had until February 6, 2017 to revoke their election. None of the 83
employees who accepted the VRIP revoked their election to retire under the terms of the plan. Non-cash special termination
benefit expense of approximately $11.5 million is expected to be recorded in the first quarter of 2017 related to these elections.
All benefits will be paid from our over funded North America pension plan. Including our non-cash special termination benefit
expense and additional initiatives across our International segment, we expect to incur between $13 million and $15 million in
restructuring expense over the next several quarters as we continue to evaluate additional restructuring activities, and anticipate
savings in 2017 of approximately $10.0 million related to these programs.
Currency exchange. Currency exchange losses were $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2.2
million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Currency exchange losses in both years were mostly unrealized and related
primarily to the effect of the strengthening US. dollar on intercompany balances. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for information regarding our currency exchange rate risk
management strategy.
GAAP operating income. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $164.2 million, an
increase of $41 .5 million, or 34%, compared to $122.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Improved operating
income for 2016 was driven by higher gross profit margins associated with our value engineering initiatives; lower selling,
general and administrative costs stemming from our cost reduction programs; lower restructuring costs and lower currency
exchange losses.
Adjusted operating income. Americas adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $162.8 million,
an increase of $20.8 million, or 15%, compared to $142.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Improved margins for
our G1 SCBA associated with our value engineering initiatives and lower selling, general and administrative expense stemming
from our cost reduction programs contributed to adjusted operating income growth during 2016.
International adjusted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $46.5 million, an increase of
$13.0 million, or 39%, compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Increased revenues from the
acquisition of Latchways combined with organic growth in both developed and emerging international markets contributed to
improved adjusted operating income as compared to 2015. Lower selling, general and administrative expense as a result of our
global cost reduction program also contributed to improvements in operating income.
