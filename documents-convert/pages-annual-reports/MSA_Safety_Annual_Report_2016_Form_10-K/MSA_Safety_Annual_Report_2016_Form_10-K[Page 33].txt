Net sales for the Americas segment were $704.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $41.1
million million, or 6%, compared to $663.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Currency translation eﬁects
decreased Americas segment sales by 4%, reﬂecting weaker currencies in Latin America. In 2015, organic constant currency
sales in the Americas segment increased 10% over the prior year on strong G1 self-contained breathing apparatus ("SCBA")
sales across the segment. Strength in the fire service market was partially offset by decreased demand in the gas, petroleum, &
chemical markets, reﬂecting decreased shipments of portable gas detection, industrial head protection, and fixed gas and ﬂame
detection.
Net sales for the International segment were $426.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an decrease of $44.2
million, or 9%, compared to $470.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Currency translation effects decreased
International segment net sales by 13%, reﬂecting weakened currencies across several International geographies, notably in
Europe and Australia. Organic constant currency sales in the International segment provided 2% growth in 2015, driven by
increased shipments of industrial head protection, portable gas detection, and ﬁxed gas and ﬂame detection in the Middle East
and Europe, and higher ﬁre helmets sales in Pacific Asia.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $501.1 million, a decrease of $14.2 million, or 3%, from
$515.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The ratio of gross profit to net sales was 44.3% for 2015 compared to
45.4% in 2014. The lower gross profit ratio in 2015 was primarily related to a less favorable product mix, increased indirect
costs, and increased amortization related to the Latchways acquisition.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $315.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $7.5 million, or 2%, from $322.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were 27.9% of net sales in 2015 compared to 28.5% of net sales in 2014. Local
currency selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6% in the current period, primarily reﬂecting Latchways
acquisition related costs of $7.5 million and Latchways operating selling, general and administrative costs of $3.2 million.

Note: Organic constant currency change is a non-GAAP financial measure provided by the Company to give a better understanding of the
Company's underlying business performance. Organic constant currency change in selling, general, and administrative expenses is calculated
by removing the percentage impact from acquisitions and currency translation eﬂects from the overall percentage change in GAAP selling,
general, and administrative expense. Management believes excluding acquisitions and currency translation effects provide investors with a
greater level of clarity into spending levels on a year-over—year basis.
