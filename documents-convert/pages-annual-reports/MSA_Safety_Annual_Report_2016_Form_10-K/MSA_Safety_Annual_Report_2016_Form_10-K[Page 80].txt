Fixed income securities consist primarily of US. government and agency bonds and US. corporate bonds. Fixed income
securities are valued at closing prices reported in active markets or based on yields currently available on comparable securities
of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar bonds, the bond is valued
under a discounted cash ﬂow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, and may
include adjustments, for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks.
Pooled investment funds consist of mutual and collective investment funds that invest primarily in publicly traded non-
U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Pooled investment funds are valued at net asset values calculated by the fund manager
based on fair value of the underlying securities. The underlying securities are generally valued at closing prices reported in
active markets, quoted prices of similar securities, or discounted cash ﬂows approach that maximizes observable inputs such as
current value measurement at the reporting date.
Insurance contracts are valued in accordance with the terms of the applicable collective pension contract. The fair value
of the plan assets equals the discounted value of the expected cash ﬂows of the accrued pensions which are guaranteed by the
counterparty insurer.
Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market and similar temporary investment funds. Cash equivalents are valued
at closing prices reported in active markets.
The preceding methods may produce fair value measurements that are not indicative of net realizable value or reﬂective
of future fair values. Although we believe the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants,
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a
different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

We expect to make net contributions of $5.9 million to our pension plans in 2017 which are primarily associated with our
International segment.
For the 2016 beginning of the year measurement purposes (net periodic beneﬁt expense), 6.5% increase in the costs of
covered health care benefits was assumed decreasing by 0.5% for each successive year to 4.5% in 2020 and thereafter. For the
2016 end of the year measurement purposes (benefit obligation), 6.0% increase in the costs of covered health care beneﬁts was
assumed decreasing by 0.5% for each successive year to 4.5% in 2021 and thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased or decreased the other post-retirement beneﬁt obligations and current
year plan expense by approximately $810 thousand and $55 thousand, respectively.
Expense for defined contribution pension plans was $5.1 million in 2016, $6.8 million in 2015 and $6.5 million in 2014 .
Estimated pension benefits to be paid under our deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans during the next five years are $20.9 million
in 2017, $21.6 million in 2018, $22.2 million in 2019, $23.7 million in 2020, $24.6 million in 2021, and are expected to
aggregate $138.5 million for the ﬁve years thereafter. Estimated other post-retirement benefits to be paid during the next ﬁve
years are $1.7 million in 2017, $1.7 million in 2018, $1.9 million in 2019, $1.8 million in 2020, $1.9 million in 2021, and are
expected to aggregate $8.1 million for the ﬁve years thereafter.
