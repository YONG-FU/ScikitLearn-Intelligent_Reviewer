The overall objective of our pension investment strategy is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit
obligations of the pension plans and to maintain suﬁicient liquidity to pay benefits and meet other cash requirements of our
pension funds. Investment policies for our primary U.S. pension plan are determined by the plan’s Investment Committee and
set forth in the plan’s investment policy. Asset managers are granted discretion for determining sector mix, selecting securities
and timing transactions, subject to the guidelines of the investment policy. An aggressive, ﬂexible management of the portfolio
is permitted and encouraged, with shifts of emphasis among equities, fixed income securities and cash equivalents at the
discretion of each manager. No target asset allocations are set forth in the investment policy. For our non-US. pension plans,
our investment objective is generally met through the use of pooled investment funds and insurance contracts.
The following table summarizes our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by fair value
hierarchy level (See Note 18):
