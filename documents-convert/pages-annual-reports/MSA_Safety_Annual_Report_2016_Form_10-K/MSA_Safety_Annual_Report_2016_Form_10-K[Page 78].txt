Discount rates were determined using various corporate bond indexes as indicators of interest rate levels and movements
and by matching our projected benefit obligation payment stream to current yields on high quality bonds.
The expected return on assets for the 2016 net periodic pension cost was determined by multiplying the expected returns
of each asset class (based on historical returns) by the expected percentage of the total portfolio invested in that asset class. A
total return was determined by summing the expected returns over all asset classes.
