Note: Organic constant currency sales change is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial measure provided by the Company to give a better understanding of
the Company's underlying business performance. Organic constant currency sales change is calculated by removing the percentage impact
from acquisitions and currency translation effects from the overall percentage change in net sales.
Net sales for the Americas segment were $678.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $26.4
million, or 4% compared to $704.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Currency translation effects decreased
Americas segment sales by 2%, reﬂecting weaker currencies across Latin America. Acquisitions, primarily Latchways,
increased sales in the Americas segment by 1%. In 2016, organic constant currency sales in the Americas segment decreased
3% compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily related to a lower level of shipments of the G1 self-contained
breathing apparatus ("SCBA"). Our sales in 2015 benefited from a higher backlog at December 31, 2014 of approximately $35
million. We shipped these additional units in 2015 and had a more normalized backlog to start 2016. Furthermore, industrial
head protection sales decreased, there was a lower level of fixed gas and ﬂame detection sales stemming from reduced project
spending in the energy market, and sales of other non-core products decreased. These declines were partially offset by an
improvement in portable gas detection as well as ﬁre and rescue helmet sales.
Net sales for the International segment were $471.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $45.1
million, or 11%, compared to $426.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Currency translation effects decreased
International segment net sales by 2%, reﬂecting a weaker British pound and euro. Acquisitions, primarily Latchways,
increased sales in the International segment by 10%. Organic constant currency sales in the International segment increased
3% in 2016, driven by growth in breathing apparatus in both developed and emerging markets, ﬁxed gas and ﬂame detection
projects in the Middle East, and portable gas detection in Europe. These increases were partially offset by a decline in fire and
rescue helmet sales and other non-core product sales.
Gross profit. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $523.6 million, an increase of $22.5 million, or 4%,
compared to $501.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The ratio of gross profit to net sales was 45.6% in 2016
compared to 44.3% in 2015. The higher gross proﬁt ratio during 2016 is primarily attributable to improved margins on our G1
SCBA associated with our value engineering initiatives and improvements in our warranty expense and inventory and
obsolescence expense.
Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $306.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $9.2 million, compared to $315.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were 26.6% of net sales in 2016, compared to 27.9% of net sales in 2015. Organic
constant currency selling, general, and administrative expense decreased 3% during 2016 driven by headcount reductions and
implementation of discretionary spending controls related to our global cost reduction program. The following table presents a
reconciliation of the year over year expense change for selling, general, and administrative expenses.
