losses of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Currency exchange losses in both periods were mostly

GAAP operating income. Consolidated operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $122.7 million, a decrease
of $11.6 million, or 9%, compared to $134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

an increase of $7.2 million, or 5%, compared to $134.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in
Americas adjusted operating income reﬂects higher sales, notably in the ﬁre sector, and controlled selling, general, and
administrative spending.

$13.3 million, or 28%, compared to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in International adjusted
operating income reﬂects a lower level of sales, higher pension costs, and higher restructuring costs associated with initiatives
to right-size our operations in accordance with our global cost reduction program.

million, or 2%, compared to an operating loss of $37.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, reﬂecting higher costs
associated with our acquisition and integration of Latchways as well as higher restructuring costs associated with our global
cost reduction efforts.
