Note 8—Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income, after the deduction of preferred stock dividends and
undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the issuance of common stock for all potentially dilutive share
equivalents outstanding not classified as participating securities. Participating securities are defined as unvested stock-based
payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
