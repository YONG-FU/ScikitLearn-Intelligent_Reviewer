Uses/Potential Us es of Capital Resources. Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources:
0 Common Stock Repurchases. We have made repurchases of our common stock in the past under our Stock Repurchase Program. As of December 31,
2016, we had 6.7 million shares authorized for repurchase remaining under our Stock Repurchase Program. Our 2015 Credit Agreement places certain
limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock.
During 2016, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock for $11.6 million (weighted-average price of $36.07 per share).
Under our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or a privately negotiated transaction, including through an ASR plan
or under a SEC Rule 10b5—1 plan. The actual timing and amount of the share repurchases will be dependent on the then current market conditions and
other business-related factors. Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements.
0 Cash Dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Board declared dividends totaling $23.8 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash
dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Boards’ approval.
0 Ac,quisitions,.,As part of our growth strategy, we are continually evaluating potential business and/or asset acquisitions and investments in market share
expansion with our existing and potential new clients.
0 CilpitaLExpenditures.,During 2016, we spent $14.3 million on capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we had committed to purchase
approximately $8 million of equipment.
0 Investments in Client Contracts. In the past, we have provided incentives to new or existing U.S. cloud-based clients to convert their customer accounts to,
or retain their customer’s accounts on, our customer care and billing solutions. During 2016, we made investments in client contracts of $7.6 million.
We have issued stock warrants to Comcast (the “Warrant Agreement”) for the right to purchase up to approximately 2.9 million shares of our common
stock (the “Stock Warrants”) as an additional incentive for Comcast to convert new customer accounts to ACP. Once vested, Comcast may exercise the
Stock Warrants and elect either physical delivery of common shares or net share settlement (cashless exercise). Alternatively, the exercise of the Stock
Warrants may be settled with cash based solely on our approval, or if Comcast were to beneficially own or control in excess of 19.99% of the common
stock or voting of the Company. As of December 31, 2016, 1.4 million Stock Warrants had vested based on the terms of the Warrant Agreement.
In January 2017, Comcast exercised 1.4 million vested Stock Warrants. We net share settled the exercise of the Stock Warrants by delivering
approximately 649,000 shares of our common stock that we were holding as treasury shares. After this exercise, approximately 1.5 million Stock
Warrants are outstanding, none of which are vested as of the date of this filing.
The Stock Warrants are discussed in more detail in Note 10 to our Financial Statements.
- Long-Q11erm Debt.,As discussed above, in March 2016, we completed an offering of $230 million of 4.25% senior subordinated convertible notes due
March 15, 2036 (the 2016 Convertible Notes). As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2016 Convertible Notes with
a par value of $230 million; (ii) 2010 Convertible Notes with a par value of $34.7 million; and (ii) 2015 Credit Agreement term loan borrowings of $135
million.

The net proceeds from the sale of the 2016 Convertible Notes were approximately $223 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and
estimated financing costs payable by us. As of December 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $115 million aggregate principal amount of our
2010 Convertible Notes for a total purchase price of approximately $216 million with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2016 Convertible
Notes. After these repurchases, the remaining aggregate principal outstanding on the 2010 Convertible Notes is $34.7 million. The remainder of the net
proceeds will be used to settle the par value of the outstanding 2010 Convertible Notes.
During the next twelve months, there are no scheduled conversion triggers on our 2016 Convertible Notes. As a result, we expect our required debt
service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2016 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $9.8 million.
