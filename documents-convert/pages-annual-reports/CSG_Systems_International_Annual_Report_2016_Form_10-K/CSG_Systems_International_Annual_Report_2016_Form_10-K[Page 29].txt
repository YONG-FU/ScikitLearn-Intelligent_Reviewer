Cloud and Relation Solutions Revenues. Cloud and related solutions revenues for: (i) 2016 increased 5% to $606.9 million, from $577.4 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015
increased 3% to $577.4 million, from $562.1 million for 2014.
o The year-over-year increase between 2016 and 2015 in cloud and related solutions revenues can be mainly attributed to the conversion of customer
accounts onto ACP, and increases in revenues from recurring managed services arrangements. As previously discussed, Comcast added approximately
two million customer accounts onto ACP during the second half of 2015 and an additional three million customer accounts onto ACP during 2016, of
which half were converted during the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, our recurring managed services revenues for 2016 grew by over 60% from
2015.
o The year-over-year increase between 2015 and 2014 in cloud and related solutions revenues is primarily the result of the conversion of new customer
accounts onto ACP, and the continued revenue growth from our Ascendon solution and managed services offering. As discussed above, Comcast added
over two million customer accounts onto ACP during the fourth quarter of 2014, and approximately two million additional customer accounts during the
second half of 2015.
Additionally, amortization of the investments in client contracts intangible asset (reﬂected as a reduction of cloud and related solutions revenues) for 2016, 2015, and
2014 was $6.6 million, $5.2 million, and $6.4 million, respectively.
Software and Services Revenues. Software and services revenues for: (i) 2016 decreased 15% to $79.4 million, from $93.7 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 9%
to $93.7 million, from $102.6 million for 2014.
o The year-over-year decrease between 2016 to 2015 in software and services revenues can be primarily attributed to the continued low market demand for
large transformational software and service deals. We continue to transition this part of our business into a more predictable recurring revenue model,
with our managed services arrangements and delivery of our cloud-based solutions.
0 The year-over-year decrease in software and services revenues between 2015 to 2014 is primarily attributed to foreign currency movements, and to a
lesser degree, continued extended sales cycles in our software and professional services business and lower demand.
Maintenance Revenues . Maintenance revenues for: (i) 2016 decreased 8% to $74.6 million, from $81.4 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 6% to $81.4 million,
from $86.6 million for 2014.
o The year-over-year decrease from 2016 to 2015 in maintenance revenues can be mainly attributed to the timing of maintenance renewals and related
revenue recognition, and is consistent with our lower software and services revenues.
o The year-over-year decrease in maintenance revenues from 2015 to 2014 can be attributed to foreign currency movements.
Total Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses for: (i) 2016 decreased 2% to $628.3 million, from $639.4 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 5% to $639.4
million, from $675.6 million for 2014.
o The $11.1 million decrease in total operating expenses between 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to favorable foreign currency movements of
approximately $8 million, operational cost improvements, to include the divestiture of Invotas in September 2015, and lower restructuring and
reorganization costs, which offset the increased cost of sales, reﬂective of our increased revenues.
- The $36.2 million decrease in total operating expenses between 2015 and 2014 is due mainly to $24 million of favorable foreign currency movements, our
focus on cost improvements (to include the benefits we received from the 2014 restructuring activities), and a reduction in restructuring and
reorganization costs.
The components of total expenses are discussed in more detail below. Cost of Cloud and Related Solutions (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of cloud and related
solutions revenues consists principally of the following: (i) data processing and network communications costs; (ii) statement production costs (e.g., labor, paper,
envelopes, equipment, equipment maintenance, etc.);
