Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US. requires us to select appropriate accounting policies,
and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our accounting policies, different business conditions or the use
of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Financial Statements.
We have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial position and the results of our operations. These critical accounting policies were
determined by considering our accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting policies identified
relate to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of goodwill and other long-lived assets; (iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss contingencies. These critical
accounting policies, as well as our other significant accounting policies, are disclosed in the notes to our Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition. The revenue recognition policy that involves the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments that may have a material impact on our
business’ operations relates to the accounting for certain software license and services arrangements. For the 2016, 2015, and 2014, software and services revenues was
approximately 10%, 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenues.
The accounting for software license arrangements, especially when software is sold in a multiple-element arrangement, can be complex and may require considerable
judgment. Key factors considered in accounting for software license and related services include the following criteria: (i) the identification of the separate elements of
the arrangement; (ii) the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements; (iii) the assessment of whether
the software, if hosted, should be accounted for as a services arrangement and thus outside the scope of the software revenue recognition literature; (iv) the determination
of vendor specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value for the undelivered element(s) of the arrangement; (v) the assessment of whether the software license fees
are fixed or determinable; (vi) the determination as to whether the fees are considered collectible; and (Vii) the assessment of whether services included in the
arrangement represent significant production, customization or modification of the software. The evaluation of these factors, and the ultimate revenue recognition
decision, requires significant judgments to be made by us. The judgments made in this area could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by
changing the amount and/or the timing of the revenue recognized. In addition, because software licenses typically have little or no direct, incremental costs related to the
recognition of the revenue, these judgments could also have a significant effect on our results of operations.
