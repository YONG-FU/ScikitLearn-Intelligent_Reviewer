The contractual obligation amounts reﬂected for our long-term debt are as of December 31, 2016, based upon the following assumptions:
(i) our 2010 Convertible Notes will remain outstanding through their maturity date of March 1, 2017; upon settlement, our cash obligation will not exceed the
principal amount; and interest paid through maturity is at a rate of 3.0% per annum (see further discussion of our cash and non-cash obligations related to the
2010 Convertible Notes in Capital Resources below);
(ii) our 2016 Convertible Notes will remain outstanding through their maturity date of March 15, 2036 (although the 2016 Convertible Notes can be converted during
the period from, and including, December 15, 2021 to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 and holders may require
us to repurchase the 2016 Convertible Notes for cash on each of March 15, 2022, March 14, 2026 and March 15, 2031); upon settlement, our cash obligation will
not exceed the principal amount; and interest paid through maturity is at a rate of 4.25%.
(iii) our Credit Agreement includes the mandatory quarterly amortization payments on the term loan as of December 31, 2016, and the interest paid throughout the life
of the term loan is based upon the interest rate applicable as of December 31, 2016.
Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements.
The operating leases are discussed in Note 9 to our Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2016, our purchase obligations consist primarily of our expected minimum
base fees under the Infocrossing service agreement (discussed in Note 9 to our Financial Statements).
The other obligations reﬂect the requirement for us to pay cash of approximately $11 million ratably over two years related to the deferred income tax liabilities
associated with our repurchase of the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities as discussed in Note 7 to our Financial Statements.
Of the total contractual obligations and commercial commitments above, approximately $438 million is reﬂected on our Balance Sheet.

Capital Resources
The following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources:
Current Sources of Capital Resources.
0 Cash,,Cash,EquivalentsandShort:termlnvestmentssAs of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $276.5
million, of which approximately 77% is in US. Dollars and held in the US. We have $4.3 million of restricted cash, used primarily to collateralize
outstanding letters of credit. For the remainder of the monies denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the US, we do not anticipate any
material amounts being unavailable for use in running our business.
0 Qperating Cash Flows. As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash ﬂows to fund our operating
activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs.
0 RevolvingLoanFacilityiAs of December 31, 2016, we had a $200 million revolving loan facility, the 2015 Revolver, with a syndicate of financial
institutions. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2015 Revolver and had the entire $200 million available to us. The 2015
Credit Agreement provides us with additional capital capacity, and greater ﬂexibility to manage our capital structure over the next five years. Our long-
term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements.
