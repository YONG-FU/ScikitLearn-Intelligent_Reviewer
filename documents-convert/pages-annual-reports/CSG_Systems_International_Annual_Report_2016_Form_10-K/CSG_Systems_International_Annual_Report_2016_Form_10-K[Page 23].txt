(6) In 2016, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of In terest (Subtopic 835-30) and ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . ASU
2015-0 3 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability,
cons istent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classiﬁed as noncurrent. We adopted both ASU’s on January 1, 2016, which
resulted in a reclassiﬁcation of our Balance Sheets for the periods presented.
