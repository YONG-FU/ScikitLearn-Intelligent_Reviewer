Signiﬁcant Clients and Industry Concentration . A large percentage of our historical revenues have been generated from our largest clients, which are Comcast
Corporation (“Comcast”), the combined Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”)/Time Warner Cable, Inc. (“Time Warner”) entity, resulting from Charter’s acquisition
of Time Warner in May 2016, and the subsequent assignment of the Time Warner agreement to Charter, and DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”). To provide a
consistent basis of comparison, the Charter and Time Warner revenues and accounts receivable balances are combined in the following tables for all periods prior to the
acquisition without adjustment.
Revenues from these clients represented the following percentages of our total revenues for the following years:
2016 2015 2014
{Comcast 26% 24% 22%)]
Charter/Time Warner (combined for all periods) 21% 21% 20%
DISH 13 % 14% 15%!
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the percentage of net billed accounts receivable balances attributable to these clients were as follows:
As of December 31,
I 2016 2015
Comcast 25% 30W)l
Charter/Time Warner (combined for all periods) 24% 13 %
DISH 10% 13 %!
We expect to continue to generate a significant percentage of our future revenues from our largest clients, mentioned above. There are inherent risks whenever a large
percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of clients. Should a signiﬁcant client: (i) terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us, in whole
or in part for any reason; (ii) significantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our solutions, the price paid for our services, or the scope of services that
we provide; or (iii) experience significant ﬁnancial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
