Credit Agreement.
In February 2015, we entered into an amended and restated $350 million credit agreement with several ﬁnancial institutions (the “2015 Credit Agreement”). The 2015
Credit Agreement provided borrowings in the form of: (i) a $150 million aggregate principal five-year term loan (the “2015 Term Loan”); and (ii) a $200 million
aggregate principal five-year revolving loan facility (the “2015 Revolver”).
The interest rates under the 2015 Credit Agreement are based upon our choice of an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75% - 2.75%, or an alternate
base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75% -1.75%, with the applicable margin, depending on our then-net secured total leverage ratio. We pay a commitment fee of
0.250% - 0.375% of the average daily unused amount of the 2015 Revolver, with the commitment fee rate also dependent upon our then-net secured total leverage
ratio. As of December 31, 2016, our interest rate on the 2015 Term Loan is 2.75% (adjusted LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum), effective through March 31, 2017, and our
commitment fee on the unused 2015 Revolver is 0.25%. As of December 31, 2016, we had no borrowing outstanding on our 2015 Revolver and had the entire $200
million available to us.
The 2015 Credit Agreement includes mandatory repayments of the aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Term Loan (payable quarterly) for the first (5% of total),
second (5% of total), third (10% of total), fourth (15% of total), and fifth years (15% of total), with the remaining principal balance due at maturity (50% of total). The
2015 Credit Agreement has no prepayment penalties and requires mandatory repayments under certain circumstances, including: (i) asset sales or casualty proceeds; and
(ii) proceeds of debt or preferred stock issuances.
The 2015 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants. In addition, the 2015 Credit Agreement has customary negative covenants that place limits on our
ability to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) create liens on its property; (iii) make investments; (iv) enter into mergers and consolidations; (v) sell assets; (vi) declare
dividends or repurchase shares; (vii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and (viii) prepay certain indebtedness; and (ix) issue capital stock of subsidiaries. We
must also meet certain financial covenants to include: (i) a maximum total leverage ratio; (ii) a maximum secured leverage ratio; (iii) a minimum interest coverage ratio;
and (iv) a limitation on capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants related to the 2015 Credit
Agreement.
