(2) C ash ﬂows from operating activities for the ﬁrst quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by a prospective change in the timing of payment terms for a key
vendor related to postage.
(3) For the third quarter of 2016, cash ﬂows from operating activities were negatively impacted by the increase in the accounts receivable balance primarily
related to the timing around certain recurring client payments that were delayed at quarter-end.
(4) Cash ﬂows from operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2016 were negatively impacted by year-end working capital timing ﬂuctuations, and a payment
made at year-end as part of the closure of several years of outstanding tax audits with the IRS.
We believe the above table illustrates our ability to generate recurring quarterly cash ﬂows from our operations, and the importance of managing our working capital
items. The quarterly and annual variations in our net cash provided by operating activities are related mostly to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities (related
mostly to ﬂuctuations in timing at quarter-end of client payments and changes in accrued expenses), and generally over longer periods of time, do not signiﬁcantly
impact our cash ﬂows from operations.
Significant ﬂuctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2016 and 2015 that impacted our cash ﬂows from operating activities are as follows:

Management of our billed accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong quarterly cash ﬂows from operating activities. Our billed trade
accounts receivable balance includes significant billings for several non-revenue items (primarily postage, sales tax, and deferred revenue items). As a result, we
evaluate our performance in collecting our accounts receivable through our calculation of days billings outstanding (“DBO”) rather than a typical days sales
outstanding (“DSO”) calculation. DBO is calculated by taking the average monthly net trade accounts receivable balance for the period divided by billings for the
period (including non-revenue items).
Our gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts receivable (“Allowance”) as of the end of the indicated quarterly
periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in thousands, except DBOS):
Quarter Ended _ Gross _ Allowance _ N cit Billeid _ DBOs
2016: 1
March 31 $ 185,297 $ (3,647) $ 181,650 61
1 June 30 182,640 (3,726) 178,914 63 1
September 30 204,516 (2,906) 201,610 69
1 December 31 212,010 (3,080) 208,930 70 l
2015:
1 March 31 $ 183,283 $ (3,187) $ 180,096 64 1
June 30 176,206 (3,937) 172,269 65
I September 30 181,225 (3,878) 177,347 62 1
December 31 182,454 (3,600) 178,854 60
The increases in gross and net billed accounts receivable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 are primarily related to the timing around certain
recurring customer payments that were delayed at each quarter end, thus negatively impacting our DB0 for the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
As a global provider of software and professional services, a portion of our accounts receivable balance relates to clients outside the US. As a result, this diversity
in the geographic composition of our client base may adversely impact our DBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an
inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions. For example, our ability to bill (i.e., send an invoice) and collect
arrangement fees may be dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various client administrative matters, local country billing protocols and
processes (including local cultural differences), and/or non-client administrative matters; (ii) us meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones; or (iii) the
overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to another vendor on a project.
