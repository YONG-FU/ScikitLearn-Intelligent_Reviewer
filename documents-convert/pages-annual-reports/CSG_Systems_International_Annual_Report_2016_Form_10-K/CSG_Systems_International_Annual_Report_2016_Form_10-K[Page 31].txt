R&D Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation) . R&D expense for: (i) 2016 decreased 3 % to $ 98.7 million, from $102.0 million for 2015; and ( ii) 2015 decreased 3% to
$102.0 million, from $104.7 million for 2014.
o The decrease in R&D expense between 2016 and 2015 is primarily due to the reassignment of personnel and the related costs previously allocated to
development projects to other area of the business.
0 The decrease in R&D expense between 2015 and 2014 can be attributed to favorable foreign currency movements.
Our R&D efforts are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable service providers worldwide to provide a more personalized customer experience
while introducing new digital products and services. This includes the continued investment in our business support solutions aimed at improving a providers’ time-to-
market for new offerings, ﬂexibility, scalability, and total cost of ownership.
As a percentage of total revenues, R&D expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 13.0%, 13.5%, and 13.9%, respectively. We anticipate the level of R&D investment to
trend up due to the heightened level of our planned investments for 2017.
Selling, General and Administrative Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation) (“SG&A ”) . SG&A expense for: (i) 2016 was $140.5 million, relatively consistent when
compared to $139.8 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 9% to $139.8 million, from $153.5 million for 2014.
° SG&A expense increased $0.7 million between 2016 and 2015, due primarily to higher incentive compensation for 2016, which was offset by favorable
foreign currency movements.
0 The decrease in SG&A expense between 2015 and 2014 reﬂect: (i) the financial beneﬁts of the restructuring activities undertaken in 2014 to reduce our sales
and marketing costs; (ii) focus on cost improvements, to include the divestiture of Invotas; and (iii) impact of foreign currency movements. Additionally, it
should be noted that 2014 SG&A expense benefited from a settlement agreement ending litigation that we had asserted against a third party for patent
infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. In exchange for the release from the lawsuit we initiated, we recorded $3.9 million (net of a time value
discount and legal costs incurred) as a reduction of SG&A expenses in that period.
As a percentage of total revenues, SG&A expense for 2016, 2015, and 2014 was 18.5%, 18.6%, and 20.4%, respectively.
Depreciation Expense . Depreciation expense for all property and equipment is reﬂected separately in the aggregate and is not included in the cost of revenues or the
other components of operating expenses. Depreciation expense for: (i) 2016 was $13.6 million, an 8% decrease from $14.8 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 was $14.8
million, a slight increase from $14.1 million for 2014. The decrease in depreciation expense between 2016 and 2015 is reﬂective of the reduced level of capital
expenditures made over the last two years. Going forward, we expect our capital expenditures to return to a more normal investment level.
Restructuring and Reorganization Charges. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we implemented various cost reduction and efficiency initiatives that resulted in restructuring and
reorganization charges of $0.4 million, $3.1 million, and $14.0 million, respectively. These initiatives included: (i) the divestitures of our Invotas cyber security business
and our Quaero marketing analytics business; (ii) the reorganization of our Content Direct solution to facilitate its alignment across our offerings, including management
programs and incentives; (iii) reducing our workforce to further align it around our long-term growth initiatives; and (iv) the abandonment of space at some of our facility
locations. We completed these initiatives in order to better align and allocate our resources around our long-term growth initiatives.
See Note 6 to our Financial Statements for additional information regarding these initiatives.
