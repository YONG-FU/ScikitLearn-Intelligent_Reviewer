debt is impacted by changes in interest rates and changes in the price and vol atility of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016 , the fair value of the 2016
Convertible Notes and the 2010 Convertible Notes was estimated at $ 258.2 million and $ 74.8 million , respectively, using quoted market prices.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Due to foreign operations around the world, our balance sheet and income statement are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the ï¬‚uctuations in the value of
currencies in which we conduct business. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the
related expenses for that revenue could be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated approximately 89% of our revenues in US. dollars. We expect that, in the foreseeable future, we will continue
to generate a very large percentage of our revenues in US. dollars.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying amounts of our monetary assets and monetary liabilities on the books of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in currencies
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of those non-U.S. subsidiaries are as follows (in thousands, in US. dollar equivalents):
December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015

A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the December 31, 2016 exchange rates would not have had a material impact upon our results of operations.
