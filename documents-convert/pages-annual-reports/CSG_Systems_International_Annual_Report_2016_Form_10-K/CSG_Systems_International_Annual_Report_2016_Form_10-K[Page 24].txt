I tem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
This report contains a number of forward-looking statements relative to our future plans and our expectations concerning our business and the industries we serve. These
forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a number of important factors, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially from estimates contained in the forward-looking statements. Some of the risks that are foreseen by management are outlined above within Item 1A., “Risk
Factors”. Item 1A. constitutes an integral part of this report, and readers are strongly encouraged to review this section closely in conjunction with MD&A.
MD&A Basis of Discussion - Impact of Divestiture
In September 2015, we sold our cyber—security business, marketed under the Invotas brand, to certain former management personnel, resulting in a gain on the sale of
$3.7 million, which is included in restructuring and reorganization charges in our 2015 Income Statement. The impact of Invotas to our business prior to the divestiture
date was not material. We retained a minority interest in the business such that the results of operations from the business are not included in our financial statements
subsequent to the divestiture date.
In February 2016, this business was acquired by a third-party. Based on the terms of our agreement with former management personnel, we received additional
consideration contingent upon a liquidation event, as defined in the agreement, resulting in an additional gain on the sale of approximately $6.6 million, which reduced
our 2016 restructuring and reorganization charges in our Income Statement.

Revenues. Our revenues for 2016 were $761.0 million, a 1% increase when compared to $752.5 million for 2015. The increase can be primarily attributed to a 5%
increase in our cloud and related solutions revenues. The increase in our cloud and related solutions revenues for 2016 was driven largely by the conversion of new
customer accounts onto ACP during the year, and increases in revenues from recurring managed services arrangements. These increases more than offset the decline in
our software and services and maintenance revenues.
Operating Results. Operating income for 2016 was $132.6 million, or a 17.4% operating income margin percentage, compared to $113.1 million, or a 15.0% operating
income margin percentage for 2015, with the increase mainly attributed to the scale benefits we are achieved from increasing the number of customer accounts to our
cloud solutions, and operational cost improvements made throughout 2015 and 2016, to include the divestiture of Invotas in 2015, discussed above.
Diluted EPS. Diluted EPS for 2016 was $1.90 compared to $1.87 for 2015 with the increase primarily attributed to the higher operating margin, which more than offset
the negative impact of the loss on the repurchase of the 2010 Convertible Notes and higher interest expense, both related to the refinancing of this instrument earlier this
year.
