(1) On July 13, 2012, we acquired the Ascade business, and as a result, approximately six months of their operations are included in our 2012 results (approximately $9 million of
revenue impact) and a full twelve months of their operations are included in our 2013, through 2016 results. The overall cost of the Ascade acquisition was approximately $19
million, and was paid from existing cash.
(2) In September 2015, we sold our cyber-security business, marketed under the Invotas brand, to certain former management personnel, resulting in a gain on the sale of $3.7
million. In February 2016, this business was acquired by a third-party. Based on the terms of the agreement, we received additional consideration upon a liquidation event, as
deﬁned in the agreement, which resulted in an additional gain on the sale of $6.6 million. The impact of Invotas to our business prior to the divestiture date was not material.
On July 1, 2013, we sold a small print operation, and on December 31, 2013, we sold our marketing analytics business marketed under the Quaero brand. As a result of these
divestitures, 2014 revenue levels were approximately $13 million lower when compared to our 2013 revenues generated from these businesses. We sold these businesses for a
total of approximately $6 million, and recorded a total loss on the dispositions of approximately $3 million.
(3) In March 2016, we completed an offering of $230 million of 4.25% senior convertible notes due March 15, 2036. The net proceeds of approximately $223 million will be used
to settle the outstanding 2010 Convertible Notes, due March 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we have repurchased approximately $115 million of the 2010 Convertible
Notes for approximately $216 million. The remainder of the proceeds will be used to settle the outstanding principal amount of the 2010 Convertible Notes.
In February 2015, we refinanced our Credit Agreement. As a result, under the reﬁnanced Credit Agreement, we: (i) extended the term of the agreement to February 2020; (ii)
increased the amount of the revolving credit facility from $100 million to $200 million; and (iii) borrowed $150 million, resulting in a net increase of available cash of $30
million, after paying off the outstanding $120 million balance from the term loan under the previous Credit Agreement.
In November 2012, we refinanced our Credit Agreement, and as a result, under the reﬁnanced Credit Agreement, we: (i) borrowed $150 million, thus paying down $18 million
of outstanding debt; and (ii) extended the term from 2015 to 2017.
See Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our debt.
(4) In June 2013, our Board approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend to be paid to our stockholders for the first time in our history. Quarterly dividends are typically
paid each year in March, June, September, and December with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. Because of the timing of when we initiated our
dividend, 2013 only includes three quarterly dividends.
(5) In March 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) Agreement with a counterparty to repurchase $50 million of our common stock. Final share
settlement occurred in December 2015, with total shares purchased under the ASR Agreement of 1.6 million.
