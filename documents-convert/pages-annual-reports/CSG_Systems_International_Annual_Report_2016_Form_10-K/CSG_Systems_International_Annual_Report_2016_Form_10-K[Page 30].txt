(iii) client support organizations (e.g., our client support call center, account management, etc.) ; (iv) various product delivery and support organizations (e.g., managed
services delivery, product management, product maintenance, etc.); (v) facilities and infrastructure costs related to the statement production and support organizations;
and (vi) amortization of acquired intangibles. The costs related to new product development (including significant enhancements to existing products and services) are
included in R&D expenses.
The cost of cloud and related solutions for: (i) 2016 increased 5% to $283.0 million, from $270.7 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 2% to $270.7 million, from
$277.1 million for 2014. Total cloud and related solutions cost of revenues as a percentage of our cloud and related solutions revenues for 2016, 2015, and 2014, were
46.6%, 46.9%, and 49.3%, respectively.
0 The year-over-year increase in cost of cloud and related solutions between 2016 and 2015 is reﬂective of the increases we experienced in cloud and
related solutions revenues and are primarily related to increased ACP cloud-based costs and the reassignment of personnel and the related costs from other
areas of the business to client directed and funded work.
0 The year-over-year decrease in cost of cloud and related solutions between 2015 and 2014 is mainly due cost savings initiatives, and other decreases in
variable costs, and to a lesser degree, favorable foreign currency movements.
Cost of Software and Services (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of software and services revenues consists principally of the following: (i) professional services
organization; (ii) various product support organizations (e.g., delivery, etc.); (ii) (iii) facilities and infrastructure costs related to these organizations; and (iv) third-party
software costs and/or royalties related to certain software products. The costs related to new product development (including significant enhancements to existing
products and services) are included in R&D expenses.
The cost of software and services for: (i) 2016 decreased 28% to $49.2 million, from $68.6 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 decreased 14% to $68.6 million, from $79.6
million for 2014.
o The year-over-year decrease in cost of software and services between 2016 and 2015 is mainly due to targeted efficiencies and cost improvements within
our professional services practice, estimated costs overruns recorded in the first quarter of 2015 related to a large software and services implementation
project, discussed below, and foreign currency movements.
0 The year-over-year decrease in cost of software and services between 2015 and 2014 is primarily attributed to favorable foreign currency movements, and
to a lesser degree, targeted efficiencies and cost improvements within our professional services practice.
Total cost of software and services as a percentage of our software and services revenues for 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 62.0%, 73.2%, and 77.6%, respectively, with
the level and variability of these percentages reﬂective of the negative impact of two large implementation projects. In the first quarter of 2014, we incurred a loss of
approximately $4 million related to a large software and implementation project (to be substantially completed in 2019) due to estimated cost overruns. In the first
quarter of 2015, we incurred a loss of approximately $5 million on another large software and services implementation project (substantially completed in the third
quarter of 2016) due to estimated cost overruns.
Variability in quarterly revenues and operating results are inherent characteristics of companies that sell software licenses and perform professional services. Our
quarterly revenues for software licenses and professional services may ﬂuctuate, depending on various factors, including the timing of executed contracts and revenue
recognition, and the delivery of contracted solutions. However, the costs associated with software and professional services revenues are not subject to the same degree
of variability (e.g., these costs are generally fixed in nature within a relatively short period of time), and thus, ﬂuctuations in our cost of software and services as a
percentage of our software and services revenues will likely occur between periods.
Cost of Maintenance (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of maintenance consists principally of the following: (i) client support organizations (e. g., our client support
call center, account management, etc); (ii) various product support organizations (e.g., product maintenance, product management, etc.); (iii) facilities and infrastructure
costs related to these organizations; and (iv) amortization of acquired intangibles.
The cost of maintenance for: (i) 2016 increased 6% to $43.0 million, from $40.4 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 increased 24% to $40.4 million, from $32.6 million for
2014. Total cost of maintenance as a percentage of our maintenance revenues for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were 57.6%, 49.6%, and 37.7%, respectively.
0 The increase in cost of maintenance between 2016 and 2015 can be primarily attributed to the reassignment of personnel and the related costs to maintenance
projects from other projects, and an increase in third party maintenance costs.
0 The increase in cost of maintenance between 2015 and 2014 can be mainly attributed to the reassignment of personnel and the related costs to maintenance
projects from other projects, offset by the favorable movements in foreign currency between years.
