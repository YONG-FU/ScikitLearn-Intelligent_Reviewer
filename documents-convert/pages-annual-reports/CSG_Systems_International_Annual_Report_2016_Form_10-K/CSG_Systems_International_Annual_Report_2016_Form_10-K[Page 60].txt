Convertible Notes.
2016 Convertible Notes. In March 2016, we completed an offering of $230 million of 4.25% senior convertible notes due March 15, 2036 (the “2016 Convertible
Notes”) to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2016 Convertible Notes are unsecured obligations and
will pay 4.25% annual cash interest, payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2016.
The 2016 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the note holders upon the satisfaction of specified conditions and during certain periods. During the
period from, and including, December 15, 2021 to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 and on or after December 15, 2035,
holders may convert all or any portion of their 2016 Convertible Notes at the conversion rate then in effect at any time regardless of these conditions. The 2016
Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 17.4642 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2016 Convertible Notes,
which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $57.26 per share of our common stock. Under the terms of the 2016 Convertible Notes, we will adjust
the conversion rate for any quarterly dividends exceeding $0.185 per share. We will settle conversions of the 2016 Convertible Notes by paying or delivering, as the case
may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. It is our current intent and policy to settle our conversion obligations as follows: (i)
pay cash for 100% of the par value of the 2016 Convertible Notes that are converted; and (ii) to the extent the value of our conversion obligation exceeds the par value,
we can satisfy the remaining conversion obligation in our common stock, cash or a combination thereof
Holders may require CSG to repurchase the 2016 Convertible Notes for cash on each of March 15, 2022, March 15, 2026, and March 15, 2031, or upon the occurrence of
a fundamental change (as defined in the 2016 Convertible Notes Indenture (“2016 Notes Indenture”)) in each case at a purchase price equal to the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.
We may not redeem the 2016 Convertible Notes prior to March 20, 2020. On or after March 20, 2020, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2016 Convertible Notes
if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive)
during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on
which CSG provides notice of redemption. On or after March 15, 2022, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2016 Convertible Notes regardless of the sales price
condition described in the preceding sentence. In each case, the redemption price will equal the principal amount of the 2016 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest.
The 2016 Notes Indenture includes customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the 2016 Convertible Notes may be due and payable
immediately. The Notes Indenture contains customary affirmative covenants, including compliance with terms of certain other indebtedness of the Company over a
defined threshold amount.
The net proceeds from the sale of the 2016 Convertible Notes were approximately $223 million after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. As of December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $115 million aggregate principal amount of our 2010 Convertible Notes for $215.6
million (see additional discussion in 2010 Convertible Notes below) with the net proceeds from the offering of the 2016 Convertible Notes. The remainder of the net
proceeds will be used to settle the outstanding 2010 Convertible Notes.
The original issue discount (“OID”) related to the 2016 Convertible Notes of $15.9 million, as a result of an effective interest rate of the liability component of 5.63%
compared to the cash interest rate of 4.25%, is being amortized to interest expense through December 15, 2021, the first date the 2016 Convertible Notes can be put back
to us by the holders.
