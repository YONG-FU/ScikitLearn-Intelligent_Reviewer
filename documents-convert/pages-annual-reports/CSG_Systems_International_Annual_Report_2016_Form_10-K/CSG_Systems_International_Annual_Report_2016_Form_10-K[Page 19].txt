paid to stockholders in March, June, September, and December of 2016 and 2015, as detailed in the table above. Going forward, we expect to continue to pay dividends
each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount and timing subject to the Board’s approval. In January 2017, our Board declared a dividend of
$01975 per share of common stock to be paid on March 30, 2017 for shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2017.
The payment of dividends is subject to the covenants of our Credit Agreement, and has certain impacts to our convertible debt (the 2010 Convertible Notes and the 2016
Convertible Notes). See Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our long-term debt.
