*** Conﬁdential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately ﬁled with the Commission.
Customer Interaction Tracking® (CIT). CIT is an add-on module offered with ACSR® that provides enhanced methods for tracking the
interaction with Customer’s Connected Subscriber base. The interaction may be manually initiated by a CSR or automatically generated by the
Customer Care and Billing System (e.g., Past Due letter sent, Statement generated, Non-Pay Disconnect generated, etc.). CSRS have the ability to use
CIT to enter notes, log information, and schedule follow-up actions. Together, these components enable Customer to maintain a complete history of
interactions and account activities with its Subscribers, both internally and externally. CIT additionally provides note taking functionality as well as
an interaction history feature that allows specific actions to be recorded in a transaction history log and allows for scheduling of Subscriber call backs
and assignment capabilities. The call backs can be reviewed by management as well as moved among CSRs.
