certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.3 million of cash restricted as to use to collateralize outstanding letters of

Cash F lows From Operating Activities. We calculate our cash ﬂows from operating activities beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or
non-operating activity (e. g., depreciation, amortization, amortization of OID, impairments, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.), and then factoring in
the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Our primary source of cash is from our operating activities. Our current business model consists of a significant amount of recurring revenue sources related to our long-
term cloud-based and managed services arrangements (mostly billed monthly), and software maintenance agreements (billed monthly, quarterly, or annually). This
recurring revenue base provides us with a reliable and predictable source of cash. In addition, software license fees and professional services revenues are sources of
cash, but the payment streams for these items are less predictable.
The primary use of our cash is to fund our operating activities. Over half of our total operating costs relate to labor costs (both employees and contracted labor) for the
following: (i) compensation; (ii) related fringe beneﬁts; and (iii) reimbursements for travel and entertainment expenses. The other primary cash requirements for our
operating expenses consist of: (i) data processing and related services and communication lines for our outsourced cloud-based business; (ii) paper, envelopes, and
related supplies for our statement processing solutions; (iii) hardware and software; and (iv) rent and related facility costs. These items are purchased under a variety of
both short-term and long-term contractual commitments. A summary of our material contractual obligations is provided below.
