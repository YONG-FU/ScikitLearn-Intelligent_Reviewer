During 2016, we repurchased $115.3 million aggregated principal amount of our 2010 Convertible N otes at a total purchase price of $215.6 million, and recognized a
loss on the repurchases of $8.6 million, to include the write-off of amortized deferred ﬁnancing costs and 01D. In addition, during 2016, we had holders convert $ 5
0,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2010 Convertible Notes for a total price of $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2016 , the principal outstanding on the 2010

The 2010 Convertible Notes are convertible into our common stock, under the specified conditions and settlement terms outlined below. As a result of us declaring a
quarterly cash dividend beginning in June 2013, the conversion rate has also been adjusted quarterly. As of December 31, 2016, the conversion rate was 44.3684 shares
of our common stock per $1,000 par value of the 2010 Convertible Notes (equivalent to a conversion price of $22.54 per share of our common stock). The Indenture
related to the 2010 Convertible Notes (“Notes Indenture”) includes anti-dilution provisions for the holders such that the conversion rate (and thus the initial conversion
price) can be adjusted in the future for certain events, to include stock dividends, the issuance of rights, options or warrants to purchase our common stock at a price
below the then-current market price, and certain distributions of common stock, property or rights, options or warrants to acquire our common stock to all or substantially
all holders of our common stock. Additionally, the conversion rate may be adjusted prior to the maturity date in connection with the occurrence of speciﬁed corporate
transactions for a “make-whole” premium as set forth in the Notes Indenture.
Prior to September 1, 2016, holders of the 2010 Convertible Notes could convert their securities at any time in the ﬁscal quarter following the period in which the price of
our common stock trades over 130% of the conversion price for at least 20 consecutive trading days in the last 30 trading days of a fiscal quarter. Beginning September
1, 2016, the holders of the 2010 Convertible Notes can elect to convert their securities at any time, with settlement occurring on March 1, 2017. As of December 31,
2016, we classiﬁed the $34.7 million principal amount of the 2010 Convertible Notes as a current liability and reclassified the difference between the principal amount
payable in cash upon conversion and the total settlement value of the 2010 Convertible Notes, or the intrinsic value of the conversion obligation, of approximately $40
million from stockholders’ equity to current portion of long-term debt conversion obligation on our Balance Sheet.
Upon conversion of the 2010 Convertible Notes, we will settle our conversion obligation as follows: (i) we will pay cash for 100% of the par value of the 2010
Convertible Notes that are converted; and (ii) to the extent the value of our conversion obligation exceeds the par value, we will satisfy the remaining conversion
obligation in our common stock. Based on our December 31, 2016 closing stock price of $48.40 per share, the 2010 Convertible Notes would have had a total settlement
value of approximately $75 million.
The remaining OID related to the 2010 Convertible Notes is being amortized to interest expense through March 1, 2017, the maturity date of the 2010 Convertible Notes.
