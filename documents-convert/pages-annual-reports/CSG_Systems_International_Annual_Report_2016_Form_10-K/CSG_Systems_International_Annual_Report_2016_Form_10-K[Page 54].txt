Earnings Per Common Share (“EPS”). Basic and diluted EPS amounts are presented on the face of our Income Statements.
No reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS numerators is necessary as net income is used as the numerators for all periods presented. The reconciliation of the basic
and diluted EPS denominators related to the common shares is included in the following table (in thousands):
2016 2015 2014
Basic weighted-average common shares 30,968 31,051 32,449 1
Dilutive effect of restricted common stock 603 624 569
l Dilutive effect of 2010 Convertible Notes 1,062 1,633 717 l
Dilutive effect of Stock Warrants 381 130 1
Diluted weighted-average common shares : 33,014: : 33,43 8: : 33,736]
In 2016, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.
The Convertible Notes have a dilutive effect only in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price exceeds the current effective conversion price (see Note 5).
The Stock Warrants have a dilutive effect only in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price exceeds the exercise price of $26.68 per warrant (under the
treasury stock method), and are not subject to performance vesting conditions (see Note 10).
Potentially dilutive common shares related to unvested restricted stock and Stock Warrants excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the effect was antidilutive,
were not material in any period presented.
Stock-Based Compensation . Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees and non-employee directors. We measure
stock-based compensation cost at the grant date of the award, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) over the
requisite service period. Benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense, if any, are reported as a financing cash inﬂow rather than as an
operating cash inﬂow.
Income Taxes. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or
refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a
change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted. In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2015-O3,
Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). This ASU requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a
reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. This ASU is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and
must be applied retrospectively. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on January 1, 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of $5.4 million of debt issuance costs
from other assets to long-term debt on our December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), requiring that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent. Prior
guidance required us to record deferred tax balances as either current or non-current in accordance with the classification of the underlying attributes. This ASU is
effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted and may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets
or retrospectively to all periods presented. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on January 1, 2016, which resulted in a decrease of $18.1 million in current deferred
income tax assets, an increase in non-current deferred income tax assets of $9.1 million and a decrease in non-current deferred income tax liabilities of $9.0 million on
our December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet.
Accounting Pronouncement Issued But Not Yet Eﬁ’ective. The FASB has issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Eﬁ’ective Date which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for
one year. In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20 Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Collectively, this ASU is a single comprehensive model which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under US. GAAP. Under the new guidance,
revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration that is expected to be received for those
goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash ﬂows arising from customer
contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The accounting guidance is
