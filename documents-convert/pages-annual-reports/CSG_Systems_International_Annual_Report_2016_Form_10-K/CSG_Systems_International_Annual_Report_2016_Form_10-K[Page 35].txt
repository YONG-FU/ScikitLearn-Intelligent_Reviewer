The unbilled accounts receivable balances above are primarily the result of several transactions with various milestone and contractual billing dates which have
not yet been reached. Unbilled accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and professional services transactions and may ﬂuctuate
between quarters, as these type of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters, as well as certain milestone billing events.
Trade Accounts Payable
Trade accounts payable decreased $8.3 million, to $35.1 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $43.4 million as of December 31, 2015, due primarily to a
prospective change in the timing of payment terms for a key vendor related to postage costs.

Accrued employee compensation increased $5.7 million to $65.3 million as of December 31, 2016, compared to $59.6 million as of December 31, 2015, with the
increase mainly due to an increase in accrued incentive compensation.
