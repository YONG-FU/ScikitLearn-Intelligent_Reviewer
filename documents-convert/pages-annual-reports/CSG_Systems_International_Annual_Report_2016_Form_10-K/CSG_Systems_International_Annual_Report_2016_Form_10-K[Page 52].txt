Deferred Revenue and Unbilled Accounts Receivable . Client payments and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred
revenue. Deferred revenue amounts expected to be recognized within the next twelve months a re classified as current liabilities. Revenue recognized prior to the
scheduled billing date is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable.
Postage. We pass through to our clients the cost of postage that is incurred on behalf of those clients, and typically require an advance payment on expected postage
costs. These advance payments are included in client deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (“Balance Sheets” or “Balance Sheet”) and are
classified as current liabilities regardless of the contract period. We net the cost of postage against the postage reimbursements for those clients where we require advance
deposits, and include the net amount (which is not material) in cloud and related solutions revenues.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As
of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash equivalents consist primarily of institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and time deposits held at major banks.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $4.3 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of restricted cash that serves to collateralize outstanding letters of credit. This
restricted cash is included in cash and cash equivalents in our Balance Sheet.
Short-term Investments and Other Financial Instruments . Our financial instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. Because of their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable approximate their fair value.
Our short-term investments and certain of our cash equivalents are considered “available-for—sale” and are reported at fair value in our Balance Sheets, with unrealized
gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Realized and unrealized gains
and losses were not material in any period presented.
Primarily all short-term investments held by us as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 have contractual maturities of less than two years from the time of acquisition. Our
short-tenn investments at December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted almost entirely of fixed income securities. Proceeds from the sale/maturity of short-term investments in
2016, 2015, and 2014 were $157.8 million, $193.0 million, and $197.5 million, respectively.

Valuation inputs used to measure the fair values of our money market funds were derived from quoted market prices. The fair values of all other ﬁnancial instruments are
based upon pricing provided by third-party pricing services. These prices were derived from observable market inputs.
We have chosen not to measure our debt at fair value, with changes recognized in earnings each reporting period. The following table indicates the carrying value and
estimated fair value of our debt as of the indicated periods (in thousands):
