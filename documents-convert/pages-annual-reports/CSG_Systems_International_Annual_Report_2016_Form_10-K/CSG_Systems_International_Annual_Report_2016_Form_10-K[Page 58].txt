Income Statements.
(3) Acquired client contracts represent assets acquired in our prior business acquisitions. Acquired client contracts are being amortized over their estimated useful
lives ranging from five to ten years based on the approximate pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be
realized. Classification of the amortization of acquired client contracts generally follows where the acquired business’ cost of revenues is categorized in our
Income Statements.
