Operating Income. Operating income and operating income margin for: (i) 2016 was $ 132.6 million, or 17.4 % of total revenues, compared to $113.1 million, or 15.0%
of total revenues for 2015; and (ii) 2015 was $113.1 million, or 15.0% of total revenues, co mpared to $75.7 million, or 10.1% of total revenues for 2014.
o The increases in operating income and operating income margin between 2016 and 2015 can be mainly attributed to the overall reduction in operating
expenses, as discussed above, and to a lesser degree, the scale beneﬁts from adding more customer accounts to our cloud solutions and higher revenues.
- The increases in operating income and operating income margin between 2015 and 2014 are due primarily to the overall reduction in operating expenses,
discussed above, and the scale benefits we are achieving from increasing the number of customer accounts and clients on our solutions.
For the fourth quarter of 2016, our operating margin percentage was 13.0%, which reﬂects our planned increased investments aimed at our long-term business growth,
and coupled with higher levels of employee incentive compensation earned in the fourth quarter. Going forward, we expect our operating income and operating margin
percentage to trend downward from our 2016 full year level, as we look to increase our strategic investments in R&D, our go-to-market programs, and the operating
environments for our cloud solutions (e. g. resiliency, security, etc).
Interest Expense and Amortization of Original Issue Discount (“01D”). Our interest expense relates primarily to our 2010 and 2016 Convertible Notes and our Credit
Agreement. See Note 5 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our long-term debt, to include the non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of
the convertible debt OID.
Interest expense for: (i) 2016 increased 48% to $16.3 million, from $11.0 million for 2015; and (ii) 2015 increased to $11.0 million, from $10.5 million for 2014.
o The increase in interest expense between 2016 and 2015 is mainly due to the interest on the 2016 Convertible Notes, which were issued in March 2016,
offset by the decrease in interest on the 2010 Convertible Notes due to repurchases throughout 2016.
o The increase in interest expense between 2015 and 2014 can be mainly attributed to the higher average debt balance outstanding in 2015 as compared to
2014 as a result of the additional $30 million that was borrowed in conjunction with the refinancing of the credit agreement in February 2015.
Loss on Repurchase of Convertible Notes. During 2016, we repurchased $115.3 million aggregated principal amount of the 2010 Convertible Notes for an aggregated
purchase price of $215.7 million, and recognized a loss on the repurchases of $8.7 million.
Income Tax Provision. Our effective income tax rates for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows:
2016 2015 (i) 2014 (i)
| 37% 35% 42%
(1) Our 2015 effective tax rate was positively impacted by improved earnings in our non-U.S. operations.
As ﬁirther discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we will adopt Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Compensation — Stock
Compensation (Topic 718) in the first quarter of 2017. This ASU requires a change in the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deﬁciencies, related to share-based
payment transactions, which are currently recorded in equity, and will be recorded as a component of income tax expense in the income statement. We anticipate the
adoption of this ASU will have an approximate three to four percentage point decrease on our 2017 effective income tax rate.
Liquidity
Cash and Liquidity . As of December 31, 2016, our principal sources of liquidity included cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $276.5 million,
compared to $240.9 million as of December 31, 2015. We generally invest our excess cash balances in low-risk, short-term investments to limit our exposure to market
and credit risks.
As part of our 2015 Agreement, we have a $200 million senior secured revolving loan facility (“Revolver”) with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in
February 2020. As of December 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Revolver. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and
financial covenants. As of December 31, 2016, and the date of this filing, we believe that we are in compliance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement.
