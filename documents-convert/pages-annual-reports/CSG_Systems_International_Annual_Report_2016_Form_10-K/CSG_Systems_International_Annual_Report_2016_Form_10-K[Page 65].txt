generated in the future, we will realize 100% of the benefit of our US. Federal deferred income tax assets, t hus no valuation allowance has been established. As of
December 31, 2016, we have deferred income tax assets related to state and foreign income tax jurisdictions of $2.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively, and have
established valuation allowances ag ainst those deferred income tax assets of $2.5 million and $15.4 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have an acquired US. Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward of approximately $45 million and $50 million,
respectively, which will begin to expire in 2023 and can be utilized through 2030. The acquired US. Federal NOL carryforward is attributable to the pre-acquisition
periods of acquired subsidiaries. The annual utilization of this US. Federal NOL carryforward is limited pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have: (i) state NOL carryforwards of approximately $63 million for both years, which will expire
beginning in 2017 and end in 2037; and (ii) foreign subsidiary NOL carryforwards of approximately $87 million and $91 million, respectively, which will expire
beginning in 2017, with a portion of the losses available over an indefinite period of time.
Our 2004 Convertible Debt Securities, which we fully extinguished in 2011, were subject to special US. Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt
instruments. These regulations allowed us to take a tax deduction for interest expense on our US. Federal income tax return at a constant rate of 9.09% (subject to certain
adjustments), compounded semi-annually, which represented the estimated yield on comparable non-contingent, non-convertible, fixed-rate debt instruments with terms
and conditions otherwise similar to the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities. This interest expense tax deduction was greater than the interest expense reﬂected in the
accompanying Income Statements, thus creating a deferred income tax liability. The extinguishment of the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities resulted in: (i) the holders of
the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities not having the ability to achieve the 9.09% target yield, and (ii) a requirement for us to pay an amount equal to the cumulative
deferred income tax liability to the US. tax authorities (without interest or penalties). During 2011, we paid cash of approximately $6 million related to the deferred
income tax liabilities associated with the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities repurchased in 2011. In 2016 and 2015, we paid cash of $5.6 million in each of the years
related to the deferred income tax liabilities associated with the 2004 Convertible Debt Securities repurchased in 2009 and 2010. The remaining balance owed of
approximately $11 million will be paid ratably over the next two years.
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate, including US. Federal, state
and foreign income tax jurisdictions. Various judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes.
During the ordinary course of business, there are certain transactions and calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, we
may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities, which could result in adverse outcomes. For these reasons, we establish a liability
associated with unrecognized tax benefits based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This liability is adjusted based upon changing facts and
circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the expiration of a statute of limitations or the refinement of an estimate.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):
2016 7 2015 _ 2014
:Balance,ﬁginningoifyear $ 4,079 $ 3,417 $ 3,713 1

Reductions for tax positions of prior years (543 )_ (413 )_ (677)
:Balance, end of year $ 1,891 $ 4,079 $ 3,417 1
We recognize interest and penalty expense associated with our liability for unrecognized tax beneﬁts as a component of income tax expense in our Income
Statements. In addition to the $1.9 million, $4.1 million, and $3.4 million of liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had
$0.4 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, of income tax-related accrued interest, net of any federal beneﬁt of deduction. If recognized, the $1.9 million of
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016, would favorably impact our effective tax rate in future periods.
We ﬁle income tax returns in the US. Federal jurisdiction, various US. state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions. The US, UK, and Australia are the
main taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. The years open for audit vary depending on the taxing jurisdiction. During 2016, the US. Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) completed its audits of our 2010 through 2012 tax years and in December 2016 we made an additional payment of approximately $8 million and entered into an
agreement with the IRS closing the audits for those tax years. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts will decrease
by up to $0.3 million over the next twelve months due to completion of audits and the expiration of statute of limitations.
