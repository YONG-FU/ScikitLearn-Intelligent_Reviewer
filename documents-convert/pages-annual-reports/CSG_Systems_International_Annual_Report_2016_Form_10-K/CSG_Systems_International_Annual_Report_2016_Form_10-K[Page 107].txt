Settlement. For purposes of this Section 3(e)(ii), beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder. Within three (3) Business Days of any written request
of the Holder, the Company shall confirm in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. If on any
attempted exercise of this Warrant the resulting issuance of Warrant Shares would result in the Holder exceeding the Maximum
Aggregate Ownership Amount or the Maximum Aggregate Voting Amount (each, an “ Attempted Exercise ”) and the Company shall not
have previously obtained Stockholder Approval, then the Company shall only issue to the Holder such number of Warrant Shares as may
be issued below the Maximum Aggregate Ownership Amount or Maximum Aggregate Voting Amount, as the case may be, and the
Company shall, at its expense, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Stockholder Approval; provided , however , that, if such
Stockholder Approval has not been obtained within ****** ( ** ) days after the Exercise Date with respect to the Attempted Exercise,
then at any time thereafter prior to such Stockholder Approval being obtained the Holder shall be permitted to (x) deliver to the Company
a notice (a “ Net Cash Settlement Election Notice ”), pursuant to which the Holder may elect that the Attempted Exercise be settled
through Net Cash Settlement pursuant to Section 2(d) (a “ Net,C,ash,S,ettlement,Ele,ction,”) or (y) withdraw its Exercise Notice with
respect to such Attempted Exercise. In the event of any Attempted Exercise, notwithstanding any delay in settling such exercise, if and
when such exercise is settled (including as a result of a Net Cash Settlement Election), the Fair Market Value for purposes of calculating
the number of Warrant Shares issuable (in the case of a Net Share Settlement) or the amount of cash payable (in the case of a Net Cash
Settlement) shall be determined as of the original Exercise Date and not any subsequent date based upon such delayed settlement.
(iii) The Holder shall cooperate with and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the
Company in order carry out the provisions of this Section 3(e). If and when the Holder (or any subsequent transferee thereof) elects to
sell any of the Warrant Shares issued pursuant to this Warrant in a manner that complies with an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act, and the Company is requested to issue to the Company’s transfer agent an opinion of counsel permitting removal of any
restrictive legend thereon, then, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Company in support of such opinion, the Holder shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company (A) an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company,
to the effect that the proposed transaction may be effected without registration under the Securities Act, together with a duly executed
officer’s certificate containing reasonably requested certifications and representations related thereto, or (B) any other evidence
reasonably satisfactory to counsel to the Company to the effect that the proposed transaction may be effected without registration under
the Securities Act', provided , however , that (x) no such legal opinion will be required for any transaction effected in compliance with
Rule 144 under the Securities Act and (y) no such legal opinion or other evidence will be required for any transaction in which the Holder
sells or otherwise transfers this Warrant or any Warrant Shares to Comcast Corporation (or any successor publicly-held parent company
of the Holder) or any subsidiary thereof in a transaction in which this Warrant or any Warrant Shares (as applicable) remain restricted
legended securities subject to the provisions of this Section 3(e)(iii).
4. No Impairment . The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through reorganization,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms
