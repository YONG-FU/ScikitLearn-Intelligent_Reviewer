reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation or merger, be exercisable for the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or
property (“ Alternate Consideration ”) of the Company or of the successor corporation resulting from such consolidation or surviving
such merger, if any, to which the holder of the number of Warrant Shares underlying this Warrant (at the time of such reorganization,
reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation or merger, but assuming the satisfaction of all vesting milestones set forth in Section 3(a))
would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, consolidation or merger. In such event, the
aggregate Exercise Price otherwise payable for the shares of Common Stock (or such other class of Capital Stock) issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant shall be allocated among the Alternative Consideration receivable as a result of such reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, consolidation, or merger in proportion to the respective Fair Market Values of such Alternate Consideration. If and to

affiliated with the Company (or, in the case of a consolidation or merger, any other party thereto) and affirmatively make an election (or
of all such holders if none of them makes an election). From and after any such reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
consolidation or merger, all references to “Warrant Shares” herein (including with respect to the calculation of the amount of cash
payable upon a Net Cash Settlement or required to be deposited as Escrowed Proceeds upon a Fundamental Change) shall be deemed to
