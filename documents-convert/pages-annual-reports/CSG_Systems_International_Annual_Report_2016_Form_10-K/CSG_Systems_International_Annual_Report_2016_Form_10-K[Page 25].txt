Signiﬁcant Client Relationships
Comcast . Comcast continues to be our largest client. For 2016 and 2015, revenues from Comcast were $196 million and $177 million, respectively, representing
approximately 26% and 24% of our total revenues. This increase is driven primarily by the conversion of additional Comcast customer accounts to our platform, as noted
below. Our agreement with Comcast runs through June 30, 2019, with an option to extend the agreement for two consecutive one-year terms by exercising the renewal
options no later than January 1, 2019 for the ﬁrst extension option, and January 1, 2020 for the second extension option.
Since July 2014, when we entered into an expanded and extended contract with Comcast, we have converted approximately seven million residential Comcast customer
accounts onto ACP. We believe we have the opportunity to convert up to an additional two to three million Comcast customer accounts that are currently on one of our
competitor’s platforms onto our solution over the next year as part of Comcast’s future standardization initiatives for their residential business. However, the timing of
and the number of additional customer accounts to be converted to CSG, if any, is at the discretion of Comcast. Therefore, there can be no assurances as to the timing or
the number of additional customer accounts converted to us by Comcast, or whether we will experience any further material increase in revenues or profits under the
Amended Agreement. See our Risk factors for additional discussion.
A copy of the Comcast agreement and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
Charter/Time Warner. In May 2016, Charter, our then fourth largest client, received final approval from regulators and closed on its acquisition of Time Warner, which
was previously our third largest client. Consequently, the Time Warner agreement was assigned to Charter in connection with the merger and the Time Warner customer
accounts serviced by us are now owned by Charter. As a result, Charter now receives more favorable volume-tier pricing terms due to their larger, combined business
with us.
Subsequent to this acquisition, Charter is our second largest client. Our revenues from the combined Charter/Time Warner entity for 2016 and 2015 were $160 million
and $155 million, respectively, representing approximately 21% of our total revenues for both periods. Our agreement with Charter runs through December 31,
2019. The Time Warner customer accounts currently still operate under the assigned Time Warner agreement, which is set to expire on March 31, 2017. We are working
with Charter to legally combine our contract with the two businesses under one master agreement. Pending completion of this documentation, we intend to pursue an
extension of the assigned Time Warner agreement.
Both the Charter and Time Warner agreements and related amendments, with confidential information redacted, are included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with
the SEC.
DISH. DISH is our third largest client. For 2016 and 2015, revenues from DISH were $102 million and $107 million, respectively, representing approximately 13% and
14% of our total revenues. Our agreement with DISH runs through December 31, 2017, with two options to extend the term for two additional years each by exercising
renewal options on or before June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2019.
The DISH agreement and related amendments, with conﬁdential information redacted, is included in the exhibits to our periodic filings with the SEC.
