Total revenue and TAG noted above included declines of $77 million and $40 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the
same period of 2015, associated with the agreement we entered into with Mozilla Corporation (“Mozilla”) in November 2014 to compensate Mozilla for making us
the default search provider on certain of Mozilla’s products in the United States. The decline in total revenue was due to a decline in Firefox browser search
volume, while the decline in TAC was associated with an amendment to the Mozilla Agreement in the third quarter of 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue and TAG increased $350 million and $660 million, respectively, or 8 percent and 303 percent, compared to
2014. For the year ended December 31 , 2015, revenue ex-TAC (a non—GAAP ﬁnancial measure) decreased $310 million, or 7 percent, compared to 2014. The
increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in search and display revenue resulting from an increase in
revenue from distribution partners, including Mozilla, revenue from mobile devices and incremental revenue from the BrightRoll acquisition, a programmatic
video advertising platform that we acquired in December 2014. This growth was partially offset by declines in our legacy desktop display business, search
revenue driven by a decline in Yahoo search trafﬁc, and a decline in other revenue associated with Alibaba Group royalty revenue pursuant to the TIPLA, for
which we ceased recognizing fees revenue in September 2014 due to our sale of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) of Alibaba Group in the Alibaba Group’s
initial public offering (the “Alibaba Group IPO”). The increase in TAC for the year ended December 31, 2015, which exceeded the revenue increases for the
same period resulting in a decline in revenue ex-TAC, was primarily driven by higher payments to distribution partners, including Mozilla, TAC increase
associated with Yahoo Gemini, and incremental TAC related to the BrightRoll acquisition. Yahoo Gemini is our uniﬁed marketplace for search and native
advertising on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites. Gemini ads appear on search results pages in response to queries and also as native ads alongside display
content. Advertisers place ads on the Gemini platform through our simple self-serve interface, as well as through Yahoo’s traditional sales force; we do not
source Gemini ads from Microsoft or other third-party providers. Because we are the primary obligor to Gemini advertisers, we recognize Gemini revenue gross
of the related TAC paid to Afﬁliates.
Of the $350 million increase in revenue and $660 million increase in TAC for the year ended December 31, 2015, $394 million and $375 million were attributable
to the agreement we entered into in November 2014 to compensate Mozilla for making us the default search provider on certain of Mozilla’s products in the
United States.
See “Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that contributed to the changes in revenue and TAC during this period.
Mavens Revenue
One of our primary strategies is to invest in and grow our Mavens offerings. Revenue from our Mavens offerings is generated from, without duplication, (i) mobile
(as deﬁned below), (ii) video ads and video ad packages, (iii) native ads, and (iv) Tumblr and Polyvore ads and fees.
Mavens revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $2,010 million, compared to $1,660 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
change in revenue presentation associated with the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement contributed $386 million to Mavens revenue in the
year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the revenue presentation noted above, Mavens revenue would have been $1,624 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $36 million, or 2 percent, compared to the same period of 2015. The decline in Mavens revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a decline in video advertising on Afﬁliate sites associated with pricing and demand, partially offset by an
increase in mobile advertising and, to a lesser extent, social advertising.
