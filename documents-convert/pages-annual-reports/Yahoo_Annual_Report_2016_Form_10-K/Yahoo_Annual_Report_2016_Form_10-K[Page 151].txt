are signiﬁcant factual and legal issues to be resolved. Based on current information, the Company does not believe that a loss from these matters is probable
and therefore has not recorded an accrual for litigation or other contingencies relating to the Security Incidents. The Company will continue to evaluate
information as it becomes known and will record an accrual for estimated losses at the time or times it is determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably
estimable.

Stock Repurchases. In November 2013, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program with an authorized level of $5 billion, which expired in December
2016. In March 2015, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program with an authorized level of $2 billion, all of which was still available as of December 31 ,
2016. The March 2015 program, according to its terms, will expire in March 2018. Repurchases under the repurchase programs may take place in the open
market or in privately negotiated transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions, and may be
made under a Rule 10b5—1 plan.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding shares of common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company repurchased approximately 4 million shares of its common stock under its November 2013 program at
an average price of $47.65 per share for a total of $204 million.
In September and October 2014, the Company entered into two unrelated accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR”) with a ﬁnancial institution to
repurchase shares of its common stock. Under the September 2014 agreement, the Company prepaid $1.1 billion and approximately 15 million shares were
initially delivered to the Company on September 30, 2014 and are included in treasury stock. Final settlement occurred on October 17, 2014, resulting in a total
of approximately 23.5 million shares, inclusive of shares initially delivered, repurchased for $933 million, all of which are included in treasury stock. The Company
received a return of cash for the remaining amount not settled in shares of $167 million. Under the October 2014 agreement, the Company prepaid the maximum
repurchase amount of $1.0 billion and approximately 15 million shares were initially delivered on October 30, 2014. Final settlement occurred on December 9,
2014, resulting in a total of approximately 16 million shares, inclusive of shares initially delivered, repurchased for $800 million, all of which are included in
treasury stock. The Company received a return of cash for the remaining amount not settled in shares of $200 million. Both ASR agreements were entered into
pursuant to the Company’s existing share repurchase program.
The Company accounted for the September 2014 ASR as two separate transactions: (i) approximately 15 million shares of common stock initially delivered to
the Company, and $600 million was accounted for as a treasury stock transaction and (ii) the remaining $500 million unsettled portion of the contract was
determined to be a fonNard contract indexed to the Company’s own common stock. The initial delivery of approximately 15 million shares resulted in an
immediate reduction, on the delivery date, of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted
net income per share. The Company has determined that the fonNard contract, indexed to its common stock, met all of the applicable criteria for equity
classiﬁcation. The Company recorded $600 million as treasury stock and recorded $500 million, the implied value of the fonNard contract, in additional paid-in
capital on the
