Overview
Yahoo! Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Yahoo,” the “Company,” “we,” or “us”), is a guide to digital information discovery, focused on informing,
connecting, and entertaining our users through our search, communications, and digital content products. By creating highly personalized experiences, we help
users discover the information that matters most to them around the world—on mobile or desktop.
We create value for advertisers with a streamlined, simple advertising technology that leverages Yahoo’s data, content, and technology to connect advertisers
with their target audiences. Advertisers can build their businesses through advertising to targeted audiences on our online properties and services (“Yahoo
Properties”) and a distribution network of third-party entities (“Affiliates”) who integrate our advertising offerings into their websites or other offerings (“Afﬁliate
sites”). Our revenue is generated principally from search and display advertising.
We are proud of our rich history that has evolved with the Internet, beginning in 1994 when our founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo, then graduate students at
Stanford University, created Jerry and Dave’s Guide to the World Wide Web , a simple directory of websites to help people navigate the Internet. Yahoo was
incorporated in 1995 and is a Delaware corporation. We completed our initial public offering on April 12, 1996, and our stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market under the symbol “YHOO.” Yahoo is a global company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.
