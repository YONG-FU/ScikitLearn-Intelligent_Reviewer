pursuant to which we will transfer to Yahoo Holdings prior to the consummation of the Sale all of our assets and liabilities relating to our operating business,
other than specified excluded assets and retained liabilities (the “Reorganization”).
On February 20, 2017, Yahoo and Verizon entered into an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement amending the Original Stock Purchase Agreement (the
“SPA Amendment” and, together with the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the “Amended Stock Purchase Agreement”), and, concurrently with the execution
of the SPA Amendment, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings entered into an Amendment to Reorganization Agreement amending the Original Reorganization
Agreement (the “RA Amendment”). Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the SPA Amendment and the RA Amendment, Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings, and
Verizon entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Settlement and Release Agreement”).
The SPA Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the consideration to be paid by Verizon to Yahoo in connection with the Sale by $350,000,000 to
$4,475,800,000, (ii) provided that certain data security incidents to which Yahoo has been subject will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
certain closing conditions have been satisfied and in determining whether a “Business Material Adverse Effect” has occurred, and (iii) provided that the date after
which each of Yahoo and Verizon may terminate the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement if the Closing (as deﬁned in the Amended Stock Purchase
Agreement) has not occurred has been extended to July 24, 2017.
The RA Amendment provides, among other things, that Yahoo and Verizon will each be responsible for 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related
to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by the Company.
Under the terms of the Settlement and Release Agreement, among other things, Verizon released certain claims, subject to certain exceptions, it (and its
afﬁliates and representatives) may have against the Company (or its afﬁliates and representatives) relating to certain data security incidents and other data
breaches incurred by the Company.
Upon completion of the Sale, Verizon will also receive for its beneﬁt and that of its current and certain of its future affiliates, a non—exclusive, worldwide,
perpetual, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property not core to the operating business held by Excalibur lP, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (“Excalibur”), that is not being transferred to Yahoo Holdings with the operating business.
The excluded assets include our cash and marketable securities as of the closing of the Sale, our shares in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (“Alibaba Group”) and
Yahoo Japan Corporation (“Yahoo Japan”), certain other minority equity investments, and all of the equity in Excalibur. The retained liabilities will include the
0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (“Notes”) we issued in November 2013, securityholder litigation, certain director and ofﬁcer indemniﬁcation
obligations, and, pursuant to the RA Amendment, 50 percent of certain post—closing cash liabilities related to certain data security incidents and other data
breaches incurred by Yahoo. Following the closing of the Sale, the excluded assets and retained liabilities will remain in Yahoo which will be renamed Altaba Inc.
and will become an independent, publicly traded, management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The closing of the Sale is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, the approval of the Sale by our stockholders, the closing of the Reorganization,
and certain other customary closing conditions.
