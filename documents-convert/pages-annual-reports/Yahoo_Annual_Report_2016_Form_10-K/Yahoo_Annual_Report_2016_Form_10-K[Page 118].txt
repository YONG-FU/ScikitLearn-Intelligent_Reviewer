The Company’s investment portfolio includes equity securities of Alibaba Group and Hortonworks, as well as liquid high-quality ﬁxed income debt securities
including government, agency and corporate debt, money market funds, commercial paper, certiﬁcates of deposit and time deposits held with ﬁnancial
institutions. The fair value of any debt or equity security will vary over time and is subject to a variety of market risks including: macro-economic, regulatory,
industry, company performance, and systemic risks of the equity markets overall. Consequently, the carrying value of the Company’s investment portfolio will
vary over time as the value of the various marketable securities changes.
Investments in instruments that earn a ﬁxed rate or a floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have
their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while ﬁoating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Fixed
income securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer. The longer the term of the securities, the
more susceptible they are to changes in market rates.
Available-for—sale marketable debt securities are reviewed periodically to identify possible other-than-temporary impairment. The Company has no current
requirement or intent to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position. The Company expects to recover up to (or beyond) the initial cost of investment for
securities held.
