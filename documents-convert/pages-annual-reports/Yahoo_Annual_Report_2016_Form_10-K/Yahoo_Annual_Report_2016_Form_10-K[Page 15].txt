and messaging. Similarly, our competitors or other participants in the online advertising marketplace offer advertising exchanges, ad networks, demand side
platforms, ad serving technologies, sponsored search offerings, and other services that directly compete for advertisers with our offerings. Additionally, as the
use of programmatic advertising continues to increase, we compete with companies that have also invested in programmatic platform offerings. We also
compete with traditional print and broadcast media companies to attract domestic and international advertising spending. Some of our existing competitors and
possible entrants have greater brand recognition for certain products, services and apps, more expertise in particular market segments, and greater operational,
strategic, technological, ﬁnancial, personnel, or other resources than we do. Many of our competitors have access to considerable ﬁnancial and technical
resources with which to compete aggressively, including by funding future growth and expansion and investing in acquisitions, technologies, and research and
development. Further, emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide new products, services and apps faster than we can. In addition, competitors
may consolidate or collaborate with each other, and new competitors may enter the market. Some of our competitors in international markets have a substantial
competitive advantage over us because they have dominant market share in their territories, have greater local brand recognition, are focused on a single
market, are more familiar with local tastes and preferences, or have greater regulatory and operational ﬂexibility due to the fact that we may be subject to both
U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements.
If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing and deploying compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers,
developers, or distributors, our revenue and growth rates could decline.
We generate the majority of our revenue from search and display advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of current or potential
advertisers would cause our revenue and operating results to decline.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 90 percent of our total revenue came from search and display advertising. Our ability to retain and grow
search and display revenue depends upon:
- maintaining and increasing our daily active users, logged in users, page views and engagement;
- introducing engaging new products that are popular with users and advertisers and are distributable on mobile and other alternative devices and platforms;
- maintaining and expanding our advertiser base on desktop computers and mobile devices;
- achieving a better trafﬁc mix from our Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliates and improving our monetization rates on such trafﬁc;
- broadening our relationships with advertisers to small- and medium-sized businesses;
- successfully implementing changes and improvements to our advertising management platforms and formats and obtaining the acceptance of our
advertising management platforms by advertisers, website publishers, and online advertising networks;
- successfully acquiring, investing in, and implementing new technologies;
- successfully implementing changes in our sales force, sales development teams, and sales strategy;
- continuing to innovate and improve the monetization capabilities of our display and native advertising and our mobile products;
- effectively monetizing mobile and other search queries;
