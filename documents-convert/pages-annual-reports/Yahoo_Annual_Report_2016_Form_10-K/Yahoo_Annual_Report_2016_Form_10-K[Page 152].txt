Stock Plans . The Stock Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based awards to employees, including executive ofﬁcers, and consultants. The Stock Plan
permits the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and dividend
equivalents.
Options granted under the Stock Plan before May 19, 2005 generally expire 10 years after the grant date, and options granted after May 19, 2005 generally
expire seven years after the grant date. Options generally become exercisable over a four-year period based on continued employment and vest either monthly,
quarterly, semi-annually, or annually.
The Stock Plan permits the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (collectively referred to as “restricted stock awards”). The restricted stock award
vesting criteria are generally the passing of time, meeting certain performance-based objectives, or a combination of both, and continued employment through
the vesting period (which varies but generally does not exceed four years). Restricted stock award grants are generally measured at fair value on the date of
grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. Such value is recognized as an expense over the
corresponding service period.
The Stock Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 784 million shares, of which 96 million shares were still available for award grant purposes as of
December 31, 2016. Each share of the Company’s common stock issued in settlement of “full-value awards” (which include all awards other than options and
stock appreciation rights) granted on or after June 25, 2009 under the Stock Plan counted as 1.75 shares against the Stock Plan’s share limit. Each share of the
Company’s common stock issued in settlement of “full-value awards” granted on or after June 25, 2014 under the Stock Plan is counted as 2.5 shares against
the Stock Plan’s share limit.
