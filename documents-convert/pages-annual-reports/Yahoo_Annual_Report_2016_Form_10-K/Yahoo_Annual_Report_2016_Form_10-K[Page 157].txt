granted in February 2013, February 2014, and March 2015. The 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 performance-based RSU awards are generally eligible to vest in
equal annual target amounts over four years (three years for Ms. Mayer) based on the Company’s attainment of annual ﬁnancial performance goals as well as
the executive’s continued employment through each vesting date. The number of shares that ultimately vest each year will range from 0 percent to 200 percent
of the annual target amount, based on the Company’s performance. Annual ﬁnancial performance metrics and goals are established for these RSU awards at
the beginning of each year and the tranche of each RSU award related to that year’s performance goal is treated as a separate annual grant for accounting
purposes. The 2016 ﬁnancial performance metrics (and their weightings) established for the performance RSUs are: GAAP revenue (one-third), revenue
ex-TAC (one-third), and adjusted EBlTDA (one-third). The grant date fair value of the ﬁrst tranche of the March 2016 performance RSUs was $10 million, the
grant date fair value of the second tranche of the March 2015 performance RSUs was $8 million, the grant date fair value of the third tranche of the February
2014 performance RSUs was $4 million, and the grant date fair value of the fourth tranche of the February 2013 performance RSUs was $8 million. These
values are being recognized over the tranches’ twelve-month service periods. The Company began recording stock-based compensation expense for these
tranches in March 2016, when the ﬁnancial performance goals were established.
