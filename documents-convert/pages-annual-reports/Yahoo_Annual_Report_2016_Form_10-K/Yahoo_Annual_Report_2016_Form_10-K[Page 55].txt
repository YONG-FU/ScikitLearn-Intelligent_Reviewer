Revenue
We generate revenue principally from search and display advertising on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites, with the majority of our revenue coming from
advertising on Yahoo Properties. Our margins on revenue from advertising on Yahoo Properties are higher than our margins on revenue from advertising on
Afﬁliate sites, as we pay TAC to our Afﬁliates. Additionally, we generate revenue from other sources including listings—based services, e-commerce transactions,
royalties, patent licenses, and consumer and business fee-based services.
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, we reclassiﬁed certain amounts from other revenue to either search or display revenue. To conform to the current presentation, we
reclassiﬁed $29.7 million and $11.6 million to search and display revenue, respectively, previously included in other revenue for the year ended December 31,
2015, and we reclassiﬁed $39.1 million and $12.1 million to search and display revenue, respectively, previously included in other revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2014.
Search Revenue
Search revenue is generated from mobile and desktop clicks on text-based links to advertisers’ websites that appear primarily on search results pages (“search
advertising”). We recognize revenue from search advertising on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites. Search revenue is recognized based on Paid Clicks. A Paid
Click occurs when an end—user clicks on a sponsored listing on Yahoo Properties or Afﬁliate sites for which an advertiser pays on a per click basis. In October
2015, we reached an agreement with Google that provides us with additional ﬂexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads. Google’s offerings
complement the search services provided by Microsoft and Yahoo Gemini. We are considered the principal in the sale of trafﬁc to Microsoft (in markets that have
transitioned pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search
