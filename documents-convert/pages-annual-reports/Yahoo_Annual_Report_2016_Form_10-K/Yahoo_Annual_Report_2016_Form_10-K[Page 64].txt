General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $37 million, or 5 percent, compared to 2015, primarily attributable to
declines in compensation costs of $32 million, facilities and equipment expense of $25 million, travel and entertainment expense of $9 million, depreciation and
amortization expense of $3 million, and marketing and public relations expense of $3 million, partially offset by an increase in outside service provider expense of
$36 million (including advisory fees) and an increase in stock—based compensation expense of $8 million. The decline in compensation costs was primarily
attributable to a 15 percent decline in headcount year—over—year. The decline in facilities and equipment expense was driven by lower building and moving
expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $2 million compared to 2014, primarily attributable to increases of
$26 million due to net gains on disposal of assets, business tax refunds received and legal settlements in 2014 for which there are no similar beneﬁts in 2015,
depreciation and amortization expense of $14 million, travel and entertainment expense of $4 million and marketing and public relations expense of $4 million.
These increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by declines in facilities and equipment expense of $16 million, outside service
provider expense of $16 million and compensation costs of $14 million. The decline in compensation costs was primarily attributable to a 19 percent decline in
headcount year-over-year.
Amortization of Intangibles
We have purchased, and may continue purchasing, assets and/or businesses, which may include the purchase of intangible assets. Intangible assets include
customer, affiliate, and advertiser-related relationships and tradenames, trademarks and domain names. Amortization of developed technology and patents is
included in the cost of revenue—other, and not in amortization of intangibles.
