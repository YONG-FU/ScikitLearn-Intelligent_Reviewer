The fair value of option grants, including assumed options from acquisitions, is determined using the Black—Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:
Stock Options Purchase Plan (5)
Years Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,,
2014 2015 2014
Expected dividend yﬂd (1) 034, 0_% 034: l

Qpected volatility (3) 3i5_% 3i5_% 3_6;8_% l
gpected life (inyears) (4) 3.83 2.50 0.25
(1) The Company currently has no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on its common stock in the near future.
(2) The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term consistent with the expected term of the awards in effect at the time of grant.
(3) The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on its common
stock, with a term of one year or greater.
(4) The expected life of stock options granted under the Plans is based on historical exercise patterns, which the Company believes are representative of
future behavior. New grants issued by the Company had an expected life of 4 years in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, the Company did not issue new stock
options. Options assumed in acquisitions had expected lives of less than 3 years.
(5) During the first quarter of 2015, the Company discontinued the offering of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to its employees.
