relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in our consolidated statements of cash ﬂows prepared in accordance with GAAP which
incorporates all cash movements during the period.
In this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we also present adjusted GAAP revenue and cost of revenue—TAC amounts for the year ended December 31,
2016 that exclude the effect of the change in revenue presentation related to implementation of the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement.
We believe providing this additional information to investors is useful because it provides investors with comparable revenue and cost of revenue—TAC
measures for comparison to our historical reported ﬁnancial information.

For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue and TAG increased $201 million and $773 million, respectively, or 4 percent and 88 percent, compared to
2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue ex-TAC (a non—GAAP ﬁnancial measure) decreased $572 million, or 14 percent, compared to 2015. The
increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in search revenue of $559 million, partially offset by declines
in other revenue and display revenue of $254 million and $104 million, respectively.
The increase in search revenue was primarily due to the change in revenue presentation related to the implementation of the Eleventh Amendment to the
Microsoft Search Agreement, as noted above. The revenue and TAG increase from the change in revenue presentation was $812 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, search revenue declined $253 million, or 12 percent, primarily in the Americas
segment due to a decline in Paid Clicks on Yahoo Properties and Affiliate sites driven by a decline in trafﬁc, partially offset by an increase in Afﬁliate site revenue
due to improved pricing.
The decline in display revenue was primarily associated with a decline in revenue on Afﬁliate sites due to a decline in video advertising and, to a lesser extent,
audience advertising, partially offset by an increase in native advertising. This was partially offset by an increase in display revenue from Yahoo Properties for
the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in display revenue from Yahoo Properties was primarily due to an increase in audience advertising, and to a
lesser extent, video advertising, partially offset by a decline in premium advertising and, to a lesser extent, native advertising.
The decline in other revenue was primarily attributable to the completion of recognition of deferred revenue under the Technology and Intellectual Property
License Agreement (“TIPLA”) with Alibaba Group pursuant to which we recognized $199 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 (for which no similar
revenue was recognized in 2016), and a decline in listings—based revenue of $36 million due to a decline in e-commerce revenue and a directory product shut
down in 2015.
