Note 19 Microsoft Search Agreement
On December 4, 2009, the Company entered into the Microsoft Search Agreement. On February 18, 2010, the Company received regulatory clearance from
both the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission and on February 23, 2010 the Company commenced implementation of the Microsoft
Search Agreement on a market-by—market basis.
On April 15, 2015, the Company and Microsoft entered into the Eleventh Amendment, pursuant to which the terms of the Microsoft Search Agreement were
amended. Previously under the Microsoft Search Agreement, Microsoft was the exclusive algorithmic and paid search services provider to Yahoo on personal
computers for Yahoo Properties and for search services provided by Yahoo to Afﬁliate sites. Microsoft was the non-exclusive provider on mobile devices.
Pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, Microsoft will provide such services on a non-exclusive basis for Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites on all devices.
Commencing on May 1, 2015, Yahoo agreed to the Volume Commitment and displays only Microsoft’s paid search results on such search result pages.
Prior to the Eleventh Amendment, the Company was entitled to receive the Revenue Share Rate with respect to revenue generated from paid search results on
Yahoo Properties and on Afﬁliate sites after deduction of the Afﬁliate sites’ share of revenue and certain Microsoft costs. The Revenue Share Rate was
88 percent for the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the Microsoft Search Agreement and then increased to 90 percent on February 23, 2015. Pursuant to the Eleventh
Amendment, the Revenue Share Rate increased to 93 percent, but Microsoft now receives its 7 percent revenue share before deduction of the Afﬁliate site’s
share of revenue. The Company is responsible for paying the Afﬁliate for the Afﬁliate site’s share of revenue.
Additionally, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment, the Company has the ability in response to queries on both personal computers and mobile devices to
request algorithmic listings only, paid
