The Company has implemented multiple restructuring plans to reduce its cost structure, align resources with its product strategy and improve efficiency, which
have resulted in workforce reductions and the consolidation of certain real estate facilities and data centers.
The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to the Company’s plan announced in February 2016 to reduce its
workforce by approximately 15 percent by the end of 2016 and exit six offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Milan and Burbank, California,
subject to applicable laws and consultation processes, as a part of the strategic plan to simplify the Company’s product portfolio. During the year ended
December 31, 2016, in connection with this action, the Company incurred pre-tax cash charges of $47 million for severance pay expenses and related cash
expenditures, pre-tax cash charges of $17 million related to the consolidation and exit of facilities related to non—cancelable lease costs and other related costs,
pre-tax non—cash charges of $7 million related to stock-based compensation expense and less than $1 million related to impairment costs.
