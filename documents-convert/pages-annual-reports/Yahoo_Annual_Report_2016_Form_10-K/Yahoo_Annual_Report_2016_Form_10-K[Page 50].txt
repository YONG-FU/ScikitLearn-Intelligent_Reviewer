Revenue under the Search Agreement represented approximately 35 percent, 35 percent, and 37 percent of our revenue for the years ended December 31,
2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The increase in revenue from Microsoft from 2015 to 2016 was due to the change in revenue presentation related to the
Eleventh Amendment that took place in the second quarter of 2016 for which we now account for amounts paid to Afﬁliates in transitioned markets as cost of
revenue—TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue, resulting in revenue from the Microsoft Search Agreement being reported on a gross rather than net
basis. Excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation related to the Eleventh Amendment, revenue under the Search Agreement represented
approximately 25 percent of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. This was partially offset by a shift in composition of revenue due to the use of
Google and Yahoo Gemini (our uniﬁed marketplace for search and native advertising on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites) to source search results and
advertisements as allowed by the Eleventh Amendment. See Note 19—“Microsoft Search Agreement” in the Notes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for
additional information.
Key FinanCIal Metrics
The key ﬁnancial metrics we use are as follows: revenue; revenue less trafﬁc acquisition costs (“TAC”), or revenue ex-TAC; income (loss) from operations; net
income (loss) attributable to Yahoo! Inc; adjusted EBITDA; net cash provided by (used in) operating activities; and free cash ﬂow. Revenue ex-TAC, adjusted
EBITDA, and free cash ﬂow are financial measures that are not deﬁned in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We use
these non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures for internal managerial purposes and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below
for a description of, and limitations speciﬁc to, each of these non-GAAP ﬁnancial measures.
