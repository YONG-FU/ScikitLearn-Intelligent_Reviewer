For the year ended December 31, 2016, free cash ﬂow increased $4.1 billion, compared to 2015, primarily due to the satisfaction of the $3.3 billion income tax
liability related to the sale of Alibaba Group ADSs in the first quarter of 2015, for which there were no similar transactions in 2016, the net cash proceeds from
disposition of property and equipment associated with the sale of land of $246 million in the second quarter of 2016, and a cash tax refund of $190 million
associated with our claim to carry back 2015 losses and tax attributes to earlier taxable years.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, free cash ﬂow decreased $3.6 billion, compared to 2014, primarily due to satisfaction of the $3.3 billion income tax

investment initiatives in our Mail, Search, and Mavens offerings.

according to its terms, will expire in March 2018. Repurchases under the March 2015 program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, including structured and derivative transactions such as accelerated share repurchase transactions, and may be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.
