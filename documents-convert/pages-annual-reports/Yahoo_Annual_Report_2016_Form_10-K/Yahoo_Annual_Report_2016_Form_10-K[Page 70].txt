2012 repatriation in which we made a one-time distribution of cash from certain of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries. In 2015, the tax effect of our
non-U.S. operations is a detriment. This results primarily from our election to deduct foreign taxes for U.S. tax purposes rather than claim a tax credit. In
2016, we repatriated cumulative earnings from our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. This resulted in a $17 million tax expense (primarily related to
$172 million of dividend income recognizable in the U.S. with an associated $67 million U.S. tax credit for foreign income taxes that have been paid on
such earnings) related to this repatriation that is included in “effect of non-U.S. operations.” This $17 million tax expense is included as part of the total
income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016.
(4) In 2014, we settled the IRS income tax examination for the 2007 through 2010 returns resulting in a benefit of approximately $25 million. In 2015 and
2016, we settled states and foreign tax audits for various taxable years resulting in a beneﬁt of $2 million and $8 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, we repatriated cumulative earnings from our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and also intend to repatriate our future earnings from
these foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, we do not have a plan to repatriate approximately $3.3 billion of earnings related to our equity method
investment in Yahoo Japan. If those earnings were to be repatriated in the future, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment
for foreign tax credits). It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be repatriated.
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, we received a cash tax refund of $190 million associated with our claim to carry back 2015 losses and tax attributes to earlier taxable
years.
Our gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2016 was $1.1 billion, of which $1.0 billion is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.
The gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts as of December 31, 2016 increased by $7 million from the recorded balance as of December 31, 2015 primarily related to
transfer prices among entities in different tax jurisdictions.
We are in various stages of examination and appeal in connection with our taxes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Those audits generally span tax
years 2005 through 2015. As of December 31, 2016, our 2011 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under examination. We have appealed
the proposed California Franchise Tax Board’s adjustments to the 2005 through 2008 returns, but no conclusions have been reached to date. Our 2009 through
2010 California tax returns are currently under examination. Our 2011 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the California Franchise Tax
Board for California tax purposes. While it is difﬁcult to determine when the examinations will be settled or their ﬁnal outcomes, certain audits in various
jurisdictions are expected to be resolved in the foreseeable future. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable adverse
adjustment to our tax returns and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash
ﬂows. It is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax beneﬁts could be reduced by up to approximately $20 million in the next twelve months.
In the first quarter of 2015, we satisﬁed the $3.3 billion income tax liability related to the sale by YHK, our wholly-owned subsidiary, of Alibaba Group ADSs in the
Alibaba Group IPO on September 24, 2014. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued deferred tax liabilities of $13.6 billion associated with the Alibaba Group
shares that we retained. Such deferred tax liabilities will be subject to periodic adjustments due to changes in the fair value of the Alibaba Group shares.
We may have additional tax liabilities in China related to the sale to Alibaba Group of 523 million Alibaba Group shares that took place during the year ended
December 31, 2012 and related to the
