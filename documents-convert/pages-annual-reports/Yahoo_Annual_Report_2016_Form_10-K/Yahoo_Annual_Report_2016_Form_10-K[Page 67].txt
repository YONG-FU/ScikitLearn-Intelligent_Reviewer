We have implemented various restructuring plans to reduce our cost structure, align resources with our product strategy and improve efﬁciency, which have
resulted in workforce reductions and the consolidation of certain real estate facilities and data centers.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded expense of $65 million, $20 million, and $4 million related to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Paciﬁc
segments, respectively. The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to the plan we announced in February 2016 to
reduce our workforce by approximately 15 percent by the end of 2016 and exit six offices in Dubai, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Milan and Burbank,
California, subject to applicable laws and consultation processes, as a part of the strategic plan to simplify our product portfolio. During the year ended
December 31, 2016, in connection with this action, we incurred pre-tax cash charges of $47 million for severance pay expenses and related cash expenditures,
pre-tax cash charges of $17 million related to the consolidation and exit of facilities related to non—cancelable lease costs and other related costs, pre-tax
non-cash charges of $7 million related to stock-based compensation expense and less than $1 million related to impairment costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded expense of $69 million, $31 million, and $4 million related to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Paciﬁc
segments, respectively. The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to severance, facility and other related costs
pursuant to restructuring plans that we initiated in 2015.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded expense of $76 million, $25 million, and $2 million related to the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Paciﬁc
segments, respectively. The amounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 were primarily related to the consolidation of a data center as we
ceased use of that facility pursuant to a restructuring plan we initiated in 2011 and severance charges related to restructuring plans that we initiated in 2014 as
part of our location strategy and to align resources.
The $43 million restructuring liability as of December 31, 2016 consists of $3 million for employee severance expenses, which we expect to substantially pay out
by the end of the second quarter of 2017, and $40 million related to non-cancelable lease costs, which we expect to pay over the terms of the related obligations
through the fourth quarter of 2025, less estimated sublease income.
