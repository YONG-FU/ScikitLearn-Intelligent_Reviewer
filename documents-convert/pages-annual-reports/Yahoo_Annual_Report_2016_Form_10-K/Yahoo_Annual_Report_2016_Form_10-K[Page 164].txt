Note 17 Transactions with Related Parties
Revenue from related parties, excluding Yahoo Japan, represented approximately 1 percent of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and
2016. Management believes that the terms of the agreements with these related parties are comparable to the terms obtained in arm’s-length transactions with
unrelated similarly situated customers of the Company.
See Note 8—“lnvestments in Equity Interests Accounted for Using the Equity Method of Accounting” for additional information related to transactions involving
Yahoo Japan.
Note 18 Segments
The Company continues to manage its business geographically. The primary areas of measurement and decision-making are Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle
East, and Africa), and Asia Paciﬁc. Management relies on an internal reporting process that provides revenue, revenue ex-TAC (which is deﬁned as revenue
less cost of revenue—TAC), direct costs excluding TAC by segment, and consolidated income (loss) from operations for making decisions related to the
evaluation of the ﬁnancial performance of, and allocating resources to, the Company’s segments.
