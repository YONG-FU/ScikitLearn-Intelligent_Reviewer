The fair values of the Company’s Level 1 ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair
values of the Company’s Level 2 financial assets and liabilities are obtained using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for
identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices (e.g., interest rates and yield curves). The Company utilizes a
pricing service to assist in obtaining fair value pricing for the marketable debt securities. The fair value for the Company’s Level 3 ﬁnancial asset was obtained
using a Black-Scholes model.
