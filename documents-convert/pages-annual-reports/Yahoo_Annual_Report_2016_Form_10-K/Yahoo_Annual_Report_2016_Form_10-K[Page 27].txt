local currencies into U.S. dollars. Our ﬁnancial results are also subject to changes in exchange rates that impact the settlement of transactions in non-local
currencies. The carrying values of our equity investments in any equity investee are also subject to ﬂuctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies.
We use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency fonNard contracts, to partially offset certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The use of such instruments may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse ﬁnancial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. Any losses on these instruments that we experience may adversely impact our ﬁnancial results, cash ﬂows and ﬁnancial condition. Further, we hedge a
portion of our net investment in Yahoo Japan Corporation (“Yahoo Japan”) with currency fonNard contracts. If the Japanese yen has appreciated at maturity
beyond the contract execution rate, we would be required to settle the contract by making a cash payment which could be material and could adversely impact
our cash flows and financial condition. See Part II, Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this Annual Report.
Acquisitions and strategic investments could result in adverse impacts on our operations and in unanticipated liabilities.
We have acquired, and have made strategic investments in, a number of companies (including through joint ventures). Such acquisitions and strategic
investments to date were accompanied by a number of risks, including:
- the difficulty of integrating the operations, personnel, systems, and controls of acquired companies as a result of cultural, regulatory, systems, and
operational differences;
- the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
- the incurrence of additional operating losses and operating expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
- the difﬁculty of integrating acquired technology and rights into our services and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
- the failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible
assets;
- the failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;
- the potential for patent and trademark infringement and data privacy and security claims against the acquired companies, or companies in which we have
invested;
- litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions, acquired companies, or companies in which we have invested;
- the impairment or loss of relationships with customers and partners of the companies we acquired or in which we invested or with our customers and
partners as a result of the integration of acquired operations;
- the impairment of relationships with, or failure to retain, employees of acquired companies or our existing employees as a result of integration of new
personnel;
- the impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets;
- our lack of, or limitations on our, control over the operations of ourjoint venture companies;
- in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with
specific countries; and
