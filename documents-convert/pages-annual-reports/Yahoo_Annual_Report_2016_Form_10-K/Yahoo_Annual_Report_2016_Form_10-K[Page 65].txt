After recording the goodwill impairment charge for Tumblr during the fourth quarter of 2015 based on our assessment performed as of October 31, 2015, the fair
value of the Tumblr reporting unit approximated its carrying value. As such, any signiﬁcant unfavorable changes in the forecast would result in the fair value
being less than the carrying value. Subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment assessment performed as of October 31, 2015, we continued to monitor the
actual performance of our reporting units. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we determined that there were indicators present to suggest that it was
more likely than not that the fair value of the Tumblr reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The signiﬁcant changes for the Tumblr reporting unit
subsequent to the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 31, 2015 included a decline in the 2016 and beyond forecasted revenue, operating
income and cash ﬂows.
