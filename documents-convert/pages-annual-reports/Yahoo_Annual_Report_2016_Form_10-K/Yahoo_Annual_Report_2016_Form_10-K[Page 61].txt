payments are expensed ratably over the term the ﬁxed payment covers or as trafﬁc is delivered. We have an agreement to compensate Mozilla for making us
the default search provider on certain of Mozilla’s products in the United States. We record those payments as cost of revenue—TAC. Additionally, pursuant to
the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement, we now record amounts paid to Affiliates under the Microsoft Search Agreement in transitioned
markets as cost of revenue—TAC rather than as a reduction to revenue.
The following table presents cost of revenue—TAC and those expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

Cost of revenue—TAC for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $773 million, or 88 percent, compared to 2015, primarily due to the change in revenue
presentation related to the implementation of the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement that took place in the second quarter of 2016 for
which we now record amounts paid to Afﬁliates in transitioned markets as cost of revenue—TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue, resulting in
revenue from the Microsoft Search Agreement being reported on a gross rather than net basis. The revenue and TAG increase from the change in revenue
presentation was $812 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Signiﬁcant Transactions—Microsoft Search Agreement” above for further detail. For
the year ended December 31, 2016, excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, TAC decreased $39 million or 4 percent. The decline in cost of
revenue—TAC for the year ended December 31, 2016 was attributable to declines in display TAC of $113 million and TAG associated with the Mozilla
Agreement of $40 million due to an amendment entered into in the third quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by an increase in search TAC primarily from
Yahoo Gemini.
Cost of revenue—TAC for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $660 million, or 303 percent, compared to 2014, primarily due to increased payments to
distribution partners (including Mozilla which contributed $375 million) as well as increased TAC associated with Yahoo Gemini, and incremental TAC from the
BrightRoll acquisition.
Cost of Revenue—Other
Cost of revenue—other consists of bandwidth costs, stock-based compensation, content and other expenses associated with the production and usage of Yahoo
Properties, including content expense and amortization of developed technology and patents. Cost of revenue—other also includes costs for Yahoo’s technology
platforms and infrastructure, including depreciation expense and other operating costs, directly related to revenue generating activities.
