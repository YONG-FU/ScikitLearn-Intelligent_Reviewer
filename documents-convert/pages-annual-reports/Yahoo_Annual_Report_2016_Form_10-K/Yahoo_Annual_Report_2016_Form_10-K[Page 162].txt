The Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $29 million and $36 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 against certain deferred income tax
assets that are not more likely than not to be realized in future periods. In evaluating the Company’s ability to realize its deferred income tax assets, the
Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including operating results, ongoing tax planning, and forecasts of future taxable income on a
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 relates to certain foreign and some U.S. states deferred tax assets that are
not more likely than not to be realized. The Company continues to monitor its business strategies, weighing positive and negative evidences in assessing its
realization of deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company repatriated cumulative earnings from its wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and recorded a $17 million tax expense
(primarily related to $172 million of dividend income recognizable in the U.S. with an associated $67 million U.S. tax credit for foreign income taxes that have
been paid on such earnings) related to this repatriation that is included in “effect of non-U.S. operations.” This $17 million tax expense is included as part of the
total income tax beneﬁt for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company also intends to repatriate its future earnings from these foreign subsidiaries. As of
December 31, 2016, the Company does not anticipate a repatriation of its undistributed foreign earnings of approximately $3.3 billion. Those earnings are
principally related to its equity method investment in Yahoo Japan. If these earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the Company may be subject to
additional U.S. income taxes. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be repatriated.
The total amount of gross unrecognized tax beneﬁts was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2016, of which up to $0.7 billion would affect the Company’s effective
tax rate if realized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2014, 2015, and 2016 is as follows (in thousands):
