Pending Sale of the Operating Business to Verizon Communications Inc.
On July 23, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Original Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Verizon Communications Inc. (“Verizon”),
pursuant to which we have agreed to sell, and Verizon has agreed to purchase (the “Sale”), all of the outstanding shares of Yahoo Holdings, Inc, a newly formed
wholly-owned subsidiary of Yahoo (“Yahoo Holdings”) (and prior to the sale of Yahoo Holdings, to cause Yahoo Holdings to sell to a foreign subsidiary of Verizon
all of the equity interests in a foreign subsidiary of Yahoo Holdings that will hold certain foreign subsidiaries relating to our operating business), which,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Sale, will own our operating business. Under the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the aggregate consideration
to be paid to us by Verizon in connection with the Sale was $4,825,800,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Original Stock Purchase
Agreement.
Concurrently with the execution of the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Reorganization Agreement (the “Original Reorganization
Agreement”) with Yahoo Holdings, pursuant to which we will transfer to Yahoo Holdings prior to the consummation of the Sale all of our assets and liabilities
relating to our operating business, other than speciﬁed excluded assets and retained liabilities (the “Reorganization”).
On February 20, 2017, Yahoo and Verizon entered into an Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement amending the Original Stock Purchase Agreement (the
“SPA Amendment” and, together with the Original Stock Purchase Agreement, the “Amended Stock Purchase Agreement”), and, concurrently with the execution
of the SPA Amendment, Yahoo and Yahoo Holdings entered into an Amendment to Reorganization Agreement amending the Original Reorganization
Agreement (the “RA Amendment”). Additionally, concurrently with the execution of the SPA Amendment and the RA Amendment, Yahoo, Yahoo Holdings, and
Verizon entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Settlement and Release Agreement”).
The SPA Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the consideration to be paid by Verizon to Yahoo in connection with the Sale by $350,000,000 to
$4,475,800,000, (ii) provided that certain data security incidents to which Yahoo has been subject will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
certain closing conditions have been satisﬁed and in determining whether a “Business Material Adverse Effect” has occurred, and (iii) provided that the date after
which each of Yahoo and Verizon may terminate the Amended Stock Purchase Agreement if the Closing (as deﬁned in the Amended Stock Purchase
Agreement) has not occurred has been extended to July 24, 2017.
The RA Amendment provides, among other things, that Yahoo and Verizon will each be responsible for 50 percent of certain post-closing cash liabilities related
to certain data security incidents and other data breaches incurred by the Company.
