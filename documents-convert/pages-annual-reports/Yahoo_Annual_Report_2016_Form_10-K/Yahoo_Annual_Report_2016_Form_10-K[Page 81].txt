ﬁnancing activities. This use of cash was partially offset by $59 million in cash proceeds received from employee stock option exercises and employee stock
purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan, and an excess tax beneﬁt from stock-based awards of $58 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2014, the $4 billion used in ﬁnancing activities was due to $4.2 billion used for the repurchase of 102 million shares of our
common stock at an average price of $40.94 per share, $22 million used for distributions to noncontrolling interests, and $295 million used for tax withholding
payments related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and other ﬁnancing activities. This use of cash was partially offset by $308 million in cash
proceeds received from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan, and an excess tax
beneﬁt from stock-based awards of $150 million.
In 2016, 2015, and 2014, $18 million, $58 million, and $150 million, respectively, of excess tax beneﬁts from stock-based awards for options exercised in current
and prior periods were included as a source of cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities. These excess tax beneﬁts represent the reduction in income taxes othenNise
payable during the period, attributable to the actual gross tax beneﬁts in excess of the expected tax beneﬁts for options exercised in current and prior periods.
We have accumulated excess tax deductions relating to stock options exercised prior to January 1, 2006 available to reduce income taxes othen/vise payable. To
the extent such deductions reduce income taxes payable in the current year, they are reported as ﬁnancing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
ﬂows. See Note 14—“Employee Benefits” in the Notes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for additional information.
Capital Expenditures, Net
Capital expenditures, net are generally comprised of purchases of computer hardware, software, server equipment, furniture and ﬁxtures, real estate, and
capitalized software and labor for internal use software projects.
Capital expenditures, net were $11 million net benefit in 2016, $543 million net expenditure in 2015, and $396 million net expenditure in 2014. Capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 were reduced by net cash proceeds of $246 million received from the sale of land in Santa Clara, California.
Excluding the proceeds received from the land sale, capital expenditures, net were $235 million. The $308 million decrease in capital expenditures, net
(excluding land sale proceeds) for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the completion of certain Company initiatives, facilities expansions
and improvements in 2015, more efﬁcient use of existing data center capacity and overall increased controls over expense and capital expenditures. Capital
expenditures increased $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, primarily due to incremental investment in hardware to support
Company initiatives, facilities expansions and improvements, partially offset by a decline in capitalizable software projects.
We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be slightly higher than the amount reported in 2016 excluding the land sale proceeds and will be funded by our cash
ﬂows from operating activities.
