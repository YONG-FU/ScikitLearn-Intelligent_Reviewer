goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the
reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The ASU also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or
negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. Therefore, the
same impairment assessment applies to all reporting units. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or
negative carrying amount of net assets. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative
impairment test is necessary. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim or annual
goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that the adoption of this
guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of operations and cash ﬂows.
