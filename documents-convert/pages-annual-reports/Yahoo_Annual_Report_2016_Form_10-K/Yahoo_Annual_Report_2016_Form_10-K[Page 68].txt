Interest and investment income consists of income earned from cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and marketable debt securities. Interest and
investment income increased $27 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, compared to 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in interest income on our portfolio of investments as a result
of increases in short-term interest rates as well as a higher average invested balance.
Interest expense is related to the $1.4375 billion of Notes we issued in November 2013, interest expense on notes payable related to building obligations, and
capital lease obligations for data centers. Interest expense increased $2 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
compared to 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily due to the accreted non—cash interest expense related to the Notes.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $10 billion related to the sale of Alibaba Group ADSs.
We hold warrants that vested upon the December 12, 2014 initial public offering of Hortonworks Inc. (“Hortonworks”), which entitle us to purchase an aggregate
of 3.7 million shares of Hortonworks common stock upon exercise of the warrants. We hold 6.5 million preferred warrants that are exercisable for 3.25 million
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, as well as 0.5 million common warrants that are exercisable for 0.5 million shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $8.46 per share. We determined the estimated fair value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes model. For the years ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded losses of $50 million and $19 million, respectively, due to the change in estimated fair value of the Hortonworks
warrants during the period, which was recorded through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended
December 31, 2014, we recorded a gain of $57 million upon the initial public offering of Hortonworks and a $41 million gain related to the mark to market of the
warrants held as of December 31, 2014, which were included within other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
Foreign exchange (loss) gain consists of foreign exchange gains and losses due to re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
non-functional currencies, and unrealized and realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, including gains and losses related to balance sheet
hedges.
