Our operating activities for 2016 and 2014 have generated adequate cash to meet our operating needs. In 2015, we satisﬁed the $3.3 billion income tax liability
associated with the sale of Alibaba Group ADSs in the Alibaba Group’s lPO in 2014, which drove the net use of cash from operations.
As of December 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding Alibaba Group and Hortonworks equity securities) totaling
$7.9 billion compared to $6.8 billion at December 31, 2015. The increase primarily was due to cash provided by operating activities, cash proceeds from the sale
of certain property in Santa Clara, California of $246 million (net of closing costs of $4 million) and a cash tax refund of $190 million associated with our claim to
carry back 2015 losses and tax attributes to earlier taxable years.
As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding Alibaba Group and Hortonworks equity securities) totaling
$6.8 billion compared to $10.2 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease was due to our purchase of Polyvore for $154 million in cash consideration, net of
cash acquired, the repurchase of 4 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $204 million, and the settlement of the $3.3 billion income tax liability
related to the sale of Alibaba Group ADSs in September 2014.
Our foreign subsidiaries held $317 million of our total $7.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities (excluding Alibaba Group and
Hortonworks equity securities) as of December 31, 2016. We have recorded a $17 million tax expense related to the repatriation of cumulative earnings from our
wholly owned foreign subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we do not have a plan to repatriate approximately
$3.3 billion of earnings related to our equity method investment in Yahoo Japan. If those earnings were to be repatriated in the future, we may be subject to
additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits). It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if
these earnings were to be repatriated.
On May 18, 2016, we delivered notice to Citibank to terminate our credit agreement with Citibank, NA, as Administrative Agent entered into on October 19,
2012 (as amended on October 10, 2013,
