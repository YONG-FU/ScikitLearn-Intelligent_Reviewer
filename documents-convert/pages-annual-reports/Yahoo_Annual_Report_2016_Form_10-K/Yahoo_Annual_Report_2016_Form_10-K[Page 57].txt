Display Revenue
Display revenue is generated from the display of graphical, non—graphical, and video advertisements (“display advertising”). We earn revenue from guaranteed or
“premium” display advertising by delivering advertisements according to advertisers’ speciﬁed criteria, such as number of impressions during a ﬁxed period
targeted to a speciﬁc audience or on a speciﬁc placement. Also, we earn revenue from non—guaranteed display advertising, which includes native advertising, by
delivering advertisements on a preemptible basis.
We recognize revenue from display advertising on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites as impressions of or clicks on display advertisements, including native
advertising, are delivered. Impressions are delivered when a sold advertisement appears in pages viewed by users. Clicks are delivered when a user clicks on
an advertisement. Arrangements for these services generally have terms of up to one year. For display advertising on Afﬁliate sites, we pay TAC to Afﬁliates for
the revenue generated from the display of these advertisements on the Afﬁliate sites. The display revenue derived from these arrangements that involve trafﬁc
supplied by Afﬁliates is reported on a gross basis (before deducting the TAC paid to Affiliates as cost of revenue—TAC) when we are the primary obligor to the
advertisers who are the customers of the display advertising service.

During the ﬁrst quarter of 2016, we changed the account coding for certain transactions to properly reflect the allocation of display revenue between Yahoo
Properties and Afﬁliate sites. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current presentation.
Display revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $104 million, or 5 percent, compared to 2015, due to a decline in advertising revenue from
Afﬁliate sites of $144 million, partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue from Yahoo Properties of $39 million. The decline in display revenue on
Afﬁliate sites was attributable to a decline in video advertising driven by volume and pricing declines. The increase in display revenue on Yahoo Properties was
primarily due to an increase in audience advertising driven by increases in volume and pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume and pricing of premium
advertising.
