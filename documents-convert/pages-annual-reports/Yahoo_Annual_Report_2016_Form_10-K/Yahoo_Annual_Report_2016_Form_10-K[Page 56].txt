Agreement) and Google because we are the primary obligor in our arrangements with Microsoft (in transitioned markets) and Google and have discretion in how
search queries from Afﬁliate sites will be fulﬁlled and monetized. We perform the search service for mobile ads served through Yahoo Gemini, and, accordingly,
we are considered the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the search advertising service. Revenue from Afﬁliates is reported gross of
TAC payments for Microsoft (in markets that have transitioned pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement), Google and Yahoo
Gemini. We also generate search revenue from a revenue sharing arrangement with Yahoo Japan for search technology and services as reported.

Search revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $559 million, compared to 2015. The increase in search revenue was primarily due to the
change in the revenue presentation associated with the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement that took place in the second quarter of 2016
for which we now record amounts paid to Afﬁliates in transitioned markets as cost of revenue—TAC rather than as a reduction to GAAP revenue, resulting in
revenue from the Microsoft Search Agreement being reported on a gross rather than net basis. The revenue and TAG increase from the change in revenue
presentation was $812 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Signiﬁcant Transactions—Microsoft Search Agreement,” above, for further detail.
Excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, noted above, search revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 declined $253 million, or
12 percent, primarily in the Americas segment due to a decline in Paid Clicks on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites driven by a decline in traffic. A decline in
revenue of $77 million associated with the Mozilla Agreement also contributed to the decline in search revenue on Yahoo Properties. For the year ended
December 31 , 2016, despite the decline in Paid Clicks on Affiliate sites, advertising revenue on Affiliate sites grew by $112 million (excluding the impact of the
change in revenue presentation) primarily from improved Price-per—Click in the Americas segment due to a signiﬁcant reduction in lower monetizing Afﬁliate
clicks as compared to the same period of 2015.
Search revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $282 million, or 15 percent, compared to 2014, which was attributable to growth in revenue
generated on Yahoo Properties in the Americas segment. This increase resulted from higher search volume on desktop due primarily to the Mozilla Agreement,
which contributed $394 million, as well as an increase in revenue from search advertising on mobile devices. The increase was partially offset by a decline in
click volume on other visits to Yahoo Properties. Affiliate search revenue overall remained ﬂat but consisted of declines in the Asia Paciﬁc and EMEA segments
of $30 million and $13 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in the Americas segment of $42 million.
