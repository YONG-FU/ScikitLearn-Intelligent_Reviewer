Note Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions
The Company entered into note hedge transactions with certain option counterparties (the “Counterparties”) to reduce the potential dilution with respect to
Yahoo’s common stock upon conversion of the Notes or to offset any cash payment the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of
converted Notes. Separately, the Company also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the Counterparties giving them the right to purchase
common stock from the Company. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect with respect to Yahoo’s common stock to the extent that the
market price per share of its common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. The initial strike price of the warrants was $71.24. Counterparties to the
warrants may make adjustments to certain terms of the warrants upon the occurrence of speciﬁed events, including the announcement of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, if the event results in a material change to the trading price of Yahoo’s common stock or the value of the warrants. To date, two Counterparties have
given the Company notices of adjustments reducing their warrant exercise prices. The warrants begin to expire in March 2019.
