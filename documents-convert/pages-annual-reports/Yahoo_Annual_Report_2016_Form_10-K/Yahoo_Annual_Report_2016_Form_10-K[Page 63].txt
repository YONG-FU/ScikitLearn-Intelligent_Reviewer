Product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $122 million, or 10 percent, compared to 2015, primarily attributable to
declines in compensation costs of $82 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $63 million, facilities and equipment expense of $17 million, and travel
and entertainment expense of $5 million. These declines were partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $23 million, an increase of
$10 million related to product initiatives to drive search volume, and an increase in outside service provider expense of $5 million. The decline in compensation
costs was primarily attributable to a 19 percent decline in headcount year-over—year. The decline in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily
associated with a decrease in depreciation from capitalized labor. The decline in facilities and equipment expense was driven by lower telephone, data network,
maintenance and building expenses. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to higher expense in the current year related to
retention grants and performance equity awards.
Product development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $22 million, or 2 percent, compared to 2014, primarily attributable to an
increase of $51 million in stock-based compensation expense, as well as an increase in investment activities supporting our search, communications and other
product initiatives of $35 million. This increase was partially offset by a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of $37 million, facilities and equipment
expense of $15 million and compensation costs of $11 million. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was due to an increase in the number of
awards granted at a higher fair value. The decline in compensation costs is primarily attributable to a 17 percent decline in headcount year—over—year, as well as
a decline in transition and relocation costs.
