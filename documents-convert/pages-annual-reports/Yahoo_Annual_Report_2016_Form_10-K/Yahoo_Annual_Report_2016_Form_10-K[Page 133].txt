Goodwill Impairment Testing
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually (as of October 31) at the reporting unit level or whenever the Company identiﬁes certain triggering
events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Events or circumstances
that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include, among other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, regulatory changes, loss of key
personnel and reporting unit and macro-economic factors such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, ﬂuctuations in
foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is at or one level below the Company’s operating segments. The Company identiﬁed U.S. &
Canada, Latin America, and Tumblr as the reporting units below the Americas operating segment; EMEA is the reporting unit as well as the operating segment;
and Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand, India & Southeast Asia as the reporting units below the Asia Paciﬁc operating segment. These operating
segments are the same as the Company’s reportable segments.
To test for impairment, the Company uses the two-step quantitative test.
Step One
The ﬁrst step of the quantitative test involves comparing the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units to their carrying values, including goodwill.
