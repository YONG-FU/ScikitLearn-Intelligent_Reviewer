Revenue and Revenue ex-TAC by Segment
Americas
Americas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $196 million, or 5 percent, compared to 2015. The increase in Americas revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in search revenue of $478 million, partially offset by declines in other revenue and
display revenue of $235 million and $47 million, respectively. The increase in Americas search revenue was primarily due to the change in revenue presentation
associated with the implementation of the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. The revenue and TAG increase from the change in revenue
presentation was $701 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Signiﬁcant Transactions—Microsoft Search Agreement” above for further detail.
Excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, noted above, Americas search revenue declined $224 million, or 13 percent, for the year ended
December 31, 2016 primarily due to a decline in Paid Clicks on Yahoo Properties and Afﬁliate sites driven by a decline in trafﬁc, partially offset by an increase in
Afﬁliate site revenue due to improved pricing. A decline in revenue of $77 million associated with the Mozilla Agreement also contributed to the decline in
Americas search revenue on Yahoo Properties. The decline in Americas other revenue was primarily due to a decline in fees revenue and, to a lesser extent, a
decline in listings—based revenue. The decline in fees revenue was primarily due to the completion of recognition of deferred revenue pursuant to the TIPLA with
Alibaba Group in which we recognized $199 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 for which no similar revenue was recognized in 2016. Listings—based
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 declined $27 million, compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to partner agreements that ended in
2015 and a directory product shut down in 2015. The decline in Americas display revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was attributable to a decline in
premium advertising and, to a lesser extent, video and native advertising, partially offset by an increase in audience advertising.
Americas revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $459 million, or 13 percent, compared to 2014. The increase in Americas revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to increases in search and display revenue of $323 million and $239 million, respectively, partially
offset by a decline in other revenue of $103 million. The increase in Americas search revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was attributable to an
increase in search revenue from mobile devices as well as $390 million attributable to the Mozilla Agreement, partially offset by a decline in click volume on other
visits to Yahoo Properties and on Afﬁliate sites. The increase in Americas display revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily associated with
an increase in video and native advertising, including incremental revenue following the BrightRoll acquisition and an increase in revenue from mobile devices
driven by native advertising. The increase in Americas display revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 occurred despite
