sale of 140 million Alibaba Group ADSs sold in the Alibaba Group IPO that took place during the year ended December 31 , 2014. Any taxes assessed and paid
in China are expected to be ultimately offset and recovered in the U.S. through the use of foreign tax credits.
Tax authorities from the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo have assessed certain indirect taxes against our Brazilian subsidiary, Yahoo! do Brasil Internet Ltda.,
related to online advertising services. The assessment is for calendar years 2008 through 2012 and as of December 31, 2016 totals approximately $140 million.
We currently believe the assessment is without merit. We believe the risk of loss is remote and have not recorded an accrual for the assessment.
Earnings in Equity Interests
We record our share of the results of earnings in equity interests, including tax impacts, one quarter in arrears, within earnings in equity interests in the
consolidated statements of operations.
The following table presents earnings in equity interests for the periods presented (in thousands):
Years Ended December 31,
2014 2015 2016
Earnings in equity interests 8 1,057,863 8 383,571 $ 363,283 l
The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2015, was due primarily to the financial performance of Yahoo Japan. The decrease for the
year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 2014, was due primarily to the change in accounting for our investment in Alibaba Group, which we now record as
a marketable equity security. Commencing with the Alibaba Group lPO in September 2014, we no longer use the equity method to account for our interest in
Alibaba Group, and our earnings in equity interests and net income have been and will continue to be materially lower.
See Note 8—“lnvestments in Equity Interests Accounted for Using the Equity Method of Accounting” in the Notes to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for
additional information.
Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders’ percentage share of income or losses from the subsidiaries in which we hold a majority, but less
than 100 percent, ownership interest and the results of which are consolidated in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Noncontrolling interests were
approximately $5 million in 2016, compared to $8 million in 2015 and $10 million in 2014. Noncontrolling interests recorded in 2016, 2015, and 2014 were related
to the Yahoo!7 venture in Australia and New Zealand.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Yahoo! Inc.
Net loss attributable to Yahoo! Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $214 million compared to a loss of $4.4 billion in 2015, a decline of $4.1 billion
year—over—year, primarily due to a signiﬁcant decrease in goodwill and asset impairment charges, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in sales and marketing
expense, product development expense, general and administrative expense, cost of revenue—other, a gain on sale of land in 2016, and a decline in TAC
(excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation associated with the Eleventh Amendment). This was partially offset by a decrease in revenue
(excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation associated with the Eleventh Amendment) and an increase in intangible assets impairment charge.
