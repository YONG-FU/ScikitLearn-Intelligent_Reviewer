Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
In addition to uncertainty about our ability to continue to generate revenue from our foreign operations, there are additional risks inherent in doing business
internationally (including through our international joint ventures), including:
- tariffs, trade barriers, customs classiﬁcations and changes in trade regulations;
- difﬁculties in developing, stafﬁng, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural
differences;
- stringent local labor laws and regulations;
- longer payment cycles;
- credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
- proﬁt repatriation restrictions and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
- political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues;
- geopolitical events, including natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism;
- import or export regulations;
- compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials;
- antitrust and competition regulations;
- potentially adverse tax developments;
- seasonal volatility in business activity and local economic conditions;
- economic uncertainties relating to volatility in emerging markets and global economic uncertainty;
- laws, regulations, licensing requirements, and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit foreign ownership or investments;
- different, uncertain or more stringent user protection, content, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and other laws; and
- risks related to other government regulation (including actions restricting access to our products or services), required compliance with local laws or lack of
legal precedent.
The recent advisory referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union, and any resulting changes to UK or EU policies, may, among
other things, adversely affect business activity and economic conditions, cause unfavorable exchange rate ﬂuctuations, create uncertainty regarding international
data protection and transfer, government requests for information, advertising regulations, and tax rates, and affect our ability to recruit and retain employees.
We are subject to numerous and sometimes conﬂicting U.S. and foreign laws and regulations which increase our cost of doing business. Violations of these
complex laws and regulations that apply to our international operations could result in damage awards, ﬁnes, criminal actions, sanctions, or penalties against us,
our ofﬁcers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and our ability to offer products and services, and damage to our reputation. Although
we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or
agents will not violate our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and
could result in harm to our business, operating results, and ﬁnancial condition.
