Net loss attributable to Yahoo! Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4.4 billion compared to income of $7.5 billion in 2014, a decline of $11.9 billion
year—over—year, primarily attributable to a decline in other income associated with a gain on sale of Alibaba Group shares in connection with the Alibaba Group
lPO for which there was no similar activity in 2015, a goodwill impairment charge, an increase in cost of revenue—TAO, an asset impairment charge related to
originally developed and acquired content, a decrease in earnings in equity interests and a decrease in gain on sale of patents. This was partially offset by an
increase in revenue and an increase in benefit for income taxes.

(*) Net income (loss) attributable to Yahoo! Inc. as a percentage of GAAP revenue in 2014, 2015, and 2016 was 163 percent, (88) percent, and (4) percent,
respectively.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, adjusted EBITDA decreased $79 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2015, mainly due to a decline in revenue ex-TAC
(as described above) partially offset by a decline in global operating costs as well as a decline in direct costs across the segments, as described in “Segment
Reporting” below. Revenue ex-TAC, as noted above, was impacted by the completion of recognition of deferred revenue under the TIPLA with Alibaba Group in
the third quarter of 2015 for which no similar revenue was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, adjusted EBITDA decreased $410 million, or 30 percent, compared to 2014, mainly due to higher TAC payments to
support our growth and partnership initiatives across Search, Communications and Digital Content, a lower benefit from patent sales year—over—year, and an
increase in direct costs in the Americas segment, partially offset by a decline in global operating costs.
