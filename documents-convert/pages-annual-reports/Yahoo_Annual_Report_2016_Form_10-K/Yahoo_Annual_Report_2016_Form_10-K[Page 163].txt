Unrecognized tax beneﬁts recorded on consolidated balance sheets $ 1,002,500 $ 996,725,:
The Company’s gross amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts as of December 31, 2016 increased by $7 million from the recorded balance as of December 31,
2015 primarily related to transfer prices among entities in different tax jurisdictions. The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax
positions in income tax expense. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reﬂected
as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made. During 2014, 2015, and 2016, interest and penalties recorded in
the consolidated statements of operations were a charge of $83 million, $7 million, and $24 million (including interest paid of $5 million), respectively. The
amounts of accrued interest and penalties recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2016 were approximately $167 million
and $186 million, respectively.
The Company is in various stages of examination and appeal in connection with its taxes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Those audits generally
span tax years 2005 through 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s 2011 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently under
examination. The Company has appealed the proposed California Franchise Tax Board’s adjustments to the 2005 through 2008 returns, but no conclusions
have been reached to date. The Company’s 2009 through 2010 California tax returns are currently under examination. The Company’s 2011 through 2015 tax
years remain subject to examination by the California Franchise Tax Board for California tax purposes. While it is difﬁcult to determine when the examinations
will be settled or their ﬁnal outcomes, certain audits in various jurisdictions are expected to be resolved in the foreseeable future. The Company believes that it
has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable adverse adjustment to its tax returns and that any settlement will not have a material adverse effect on
its consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s unrecognized tax beneﬁts could be reduced
by up to approximately $20 million in the next twelve months.
The Company may have additional tax liabilities in China related to the sale to Alibaba Group of 523 million Alibaba Group shares that took place during the year
ended December 31, 2012 and related to the sale of the 140 million Alibaba Group ADSs sold in the Alibaba Group IPO that took place during the year ended
December 31, 2014. Any taxes assessed and paid in China are expected to be ultimately offset and recovered in the U.S. through the use of foreign tax credits.
Tax authorities from the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo have assessed certain indirect taxes against the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, Yahoo! do Brasil Internet
Ltda., related to online advertising services. The assessment is for calendar years 2008 through 2012 and as of December 31, 2016 totals approximately
$140 million. The Company currently believes the assessment is without merit. The Company believes the risk of loss is remote and has not recorded an accrual
for the assessment.
