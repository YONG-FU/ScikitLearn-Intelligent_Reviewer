At the completion date of each acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and identiﬁable
intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more frequently if impairment
indicators are present. The majority of the goodwill originating from these acquisitions was subsequently impaired in the fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 5
—“Goodwill” for results of the goodwill impairment test.
