Table,0f,C,ontents
For 2014, potentially dilutive securities representing approximately 3 million were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for these periods
because their effect would have been anti—dilutive.
The Company has the option to pay cash, issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion of the
Notes. The Company’s intent is to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash upon conversion. As a result, upon conversion of the Notes, only the amounts
payable in excess of the principal amounts of the Notes are considered in diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method.
The denominator for diluted net income (loss) per share also does not include any effect from the note hedges. In future periods, the denominator for diluted net
income (loss) per share will exclude any effect of the note hedges, if their effect would be anti—dilutive. In the event an actual conversion of any or all of the Notes
occurs, the shares that would be delivered to the Company under the note hedges are designed to reduce the dilutive effect of the shares that the Company
would issue under the Notes. See Note 11—”Convertible Notes” for additional information.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):
