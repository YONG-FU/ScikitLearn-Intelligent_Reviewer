Item 1 B. Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
Item 2. Properties
Our headquarters is located in Sunnyvale, California and consists of owned space aggregating approximately one million square feet. We lease ofﬁce space in
Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, NonNay, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. In the
United States, we lease ofﬁces in various locations, including Atlanta, Beaverton, Boston, Champaign, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Hillsboro, the Los Angeles Area,
Miami, Mountain View, New York, Omaha, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Our data centers are operated in locations in the United States, Brazil, Europe,
and Asia. In connection with our strategic plan, we are exploring contract terminations and subleases where we feel we no longer need ofﬁce space.
We believe that our existing facilities will be adequate to meet current requirements, and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed
to accommodate any further physical expansion of operations and for any additional sales ofﬁces.
