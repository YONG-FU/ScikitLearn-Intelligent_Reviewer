Deﬁnite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis, as follows:
- Customer, afﬁliate, and advertiser related relationships—one to six years;
- Developed technology and patents—three to six years; and
- Tradenames, trademarks, and domain names—three to seven years.
The Company recognized amortization expense for intangible assets of $132 million, $137 million, and $100 million for 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively,
including $65 million, $58 million, and $42 million, respectively, included in cost of revenue—other. Based on the current amount of intangibles subject to
amortization, the estimated amortization expense for each of the succeeding years is as follows: 2017: $76 million; 2018: $55 million; 2019: $30 million; and
2020 and after: $1 million.
Intangibles Impairment Testing
The Company reviews identifiable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of the assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on the lowest level of identiﬁable estimated undiscounted cash ﬂows
resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount. If the Company
determines that an intangible asset with an indeﬁnite life is more likely than not impaired, a quantitative test comparing the fair value of the indeﬁnite-lived
