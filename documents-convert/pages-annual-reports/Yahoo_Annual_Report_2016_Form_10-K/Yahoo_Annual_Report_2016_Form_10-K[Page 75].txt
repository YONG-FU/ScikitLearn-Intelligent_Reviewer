unfavorable foreign exchange ﬂuctuations related to Canada and Brazil of approximately $17 million. The decrease in Americas other revenue for the year
ended December 31 , 2015 was primarily attributable to declines in fees and listings-based revenue of $34 million and $68 million, respectively, due to a decline
in Alibaba Group royalty revenue under the TlPLA, a decline in shopping trafﬁc, expiration of a partner agreement, and declines in Yahoo Small Business
associated with a reduction in its subscriber base.
Revenue in the Americas accounted for approximately 81 percent of total revenue for 2016, compared to 80 percent in 2015 and 76 percent in 2014.
Americas revenue ex-TAC for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $478 million, or 15 percent, compared to 2015, primarily due to declines in revenue
of $505 million excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation (described further above). Americas TAC for the year ended December 31, 2016
decreased $27 million (excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation) due to declines in display TAC of $102 million and TAC associated with the
Mozilla Agreement of $40 million associated with an amendment entered into in the third quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by an increase in search TAC
primarily from Yahoo Gemini.
Americas revenue ex-TAC for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $163 million, or 5 percent, compared to 2014, due to an increase in TAC, partially
offset by an increase in revenue as discussed above. TAC in the Americas segment increased $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to
increased payments to distribution partners, including Mozilla, TAC associated with Yahoo Gemini, and incremental TAC from the BrightRoll acquisition.
Revenue ex—TAC in the Americas accounted for approximately 77 percent of total revenue ex-TAC for 2016, compared to 78 percent in 2015 and 76 percent in
2014.
EMEA
EMEA revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $54 million, or 16 percent, compared to 2015. The increase in EMEA revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2016 was attributable to an increase in search revenue of $83 million, partially offset by a decline in display revenue of $25 million and
other revenue of $5 million. The increase in EMEA search revenue was primarily due to the change in revenue presentation associated with the implementation
of the Eleventh Amendment to the Microsoft Search Agreement. The revenue and TAG increase from the change in revenue presentation was $106 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the change in revenue presentation, noted above, EMEA search revenue declined $22 million, or
20 percent, for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange ﬂuctuations of $13 million using the foreign exchange rates
from the year ended December 31, 2015 and a decline in Paid Clicks. The decline in EMEA display revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was
primarily due to a decline in premium advertising and, to a lesser extent, audience advertising, partially offset by an increase in native advertising. Additionally,
the decline in display revenue in the EMEA segment was partially due to unfavorable foreign exchange ﬂuctuations of $14 million using the foreign exchange
rates from the year ended December 31, 2015.
EMEA revenue for the year ended December 31 , 2015 decreased $31 million, or 8 percent, compared to 2014, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange
ﬂuctuations of $44 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, using the foreign currency exchange rates from the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding
the impact of foreign exchange, display and search revenue in the EMEA segment increased $21 million and $3 million, respectively, and other revenue declined
$11 million. The increase in display revenue in the segment was attributable to an increase in Affiliate revenue in the region primarily from native advertising.
