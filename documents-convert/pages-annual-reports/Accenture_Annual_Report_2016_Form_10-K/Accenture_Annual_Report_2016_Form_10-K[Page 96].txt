U.S. Pension Plan Termination
On March 18, 2016, Accenture plc’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to terminate the Company’s
U.S. pension plan, effective May 30, 2016, for all active and former employees who are no longer accruing benefits
in the pension plan (approximately 16,200 people). The amendment also provides forthe creation of a separate deﬁned
beneﬁt plan with substantially the same terms for approximately 600 active employees who are currently eligible to
accrue beneﬁts. The US. pension plan is expected to be settled in 12 to 18 months from the termination effective date,
subject to receipt of customary regulatory approvals.
The Company’s ultimate settlement obligation will depend upon both the nature and timing of participant
settlements and prevailing market conditions. Upon settlement, the Company expects to recognize additional expense,
consisting of unrecognized actuarial losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss that totaled
approximately $467,000 as of August 31, 2016, adjusted for the difference between the ultimate settlement obligation
and the Company’s accrued pension obligation. The Company does not expect the settlement of the US. pension
plan obligations to have a material impact on its cash position.
Defined Contribution Plans
In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers defined contribution
plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. Total expenses recorded for deﬁned contribution plans were
$419,932, $397,123 and $331,801 in ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
