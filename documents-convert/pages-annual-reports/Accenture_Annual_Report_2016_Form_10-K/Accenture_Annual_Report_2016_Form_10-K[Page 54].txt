We intend to continue to use a signiﬁcant portion of cash generated from operations for share repurchases during
ﬁscal 2017. The number of shares ultimately repurchased under our open-market share purchase program may vary
depending on numerous factors, including, without limitation, share price and other market conditions, our ongoing
capital allocation planning, the levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity,
general economic and/or business conditions, and board and management discretion. Additionally, as these factors
may change over the course of the year, the amount of share repurchase activity during any particular period cannot
be predicted and may fluctuate from time to time. Share repurchases may be made from time to time through open-
market purchases, in respect of purchases and redemptions ofAccenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture
Canada Holdings Inc. exchangeable shares, through the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans and/or by other means. The
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time, without notice.
Other Share Redemptions
During ﬁscal 2016, we issued 775,023 Accenture plc Class Aordinary shares upon redemptions of an equivalent
number of Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 (the “registration
statement”). The registration statement allows us, at our option, to issue freely tradable Accenture plc Class A ordinary
shares in lieu of cash upon redemptions ofAccenture Holdings plc ordinary shares held by current and former members
of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees.

Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
(1) The liability related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts has been excluded from the contractual obligations table
because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot
be determined. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements
under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
(2) Amounts represent projected payments under certain unfunded retirement plans for former pre-incorporation
partners. Given these plans are unfunded, we pay these benefits directly. These plans were eliminated for
active partners after May 15, 2001.
(3) Other commitments include, among other things, information technology, software support and maintenance
obligations, as well as other obligations in the ordinary course of business that we cannot cancel or where we
would be required to pay a termination fee in the event of cancellation. Amounts shown do not include recourse
that we may have to recover termination fees or penalties from clients.
