their operations to improve effectiveness and save costs. Compared to ﬁscal 2015, we continued to provide a greater
proportion of application outsourcing through use of lower-cost resources in our Global Delivery Network.
As we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be signiﬁcantly
affected by currency exchange rate ﬂuctuations. If the US. dollar strengthens against other currencies, resulting in
unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in US. dollars may be lower.
If the US. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue
growth and results of operations in US. dollars may be higher. When compared to the same periods in fiscal 2015,
the US. dollar strengthened against many currencies during the fourth quarter and ﬁscal year ended August 31, 2016,
resulting in unfavorable currency translation and US. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 2% and 5% lower,
respectively, than our revenue growth in local currency. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges for
ﬁscal 2017, we estimate that our full fiscal 2017 revenue growth in US. dollars will be approximately equal to our
revenue growth in local currency.
The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and
administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly
of compensation, subcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of
services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and
integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business
development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General
and administrative costs primarily include costs for non-client-facing personnel, information systems and ofﬁce space.
Utilization for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was 92%, up from 91% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 90%
in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2015. We continue to hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively
plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the
anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most signiﬁcant portion of
our operating expenses. Based on current and projected future demand, we have increased our headcount, the majority
of which serve our clients, to approximately 384,000 as of August 31, 2016, compared to approximately 358,000 as
of August 31, 2015. The year-over-year increase in our headcount reflects an overall increase in demand for our
services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with acquisitions. Annualized attrition, excluding
involuntary terminations, for the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2016 was 16%, up from 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016
and 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use
involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.
In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and geographies in order to attract and retain appropriate
numbers of qualiﬁed employees. For the majority of our personnel, compensation increases for fiscal 2016 became
effective December 1 , 2015. We strive to adjust pricing and/orthe mix of resources to reduce the impact of compensation
increases on our gross margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely
affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in the types or amounts
of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally
on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.
Gross margin (Net revenues less Cost of services before reimbursable expenses as a percentage of Net revenues)
forthe fourth quarter of ﬁscal 201 6 was 31 .3%, compared with 31 .7% for the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 201 5. Gross margin
for ﬁscal 2016 was 31.3%, compared with 31.6% for fiscal 2015. The reduction in gross margin for ﬁscal 2016 was
principally due to higher labor costs and higher costs associated with acquisition activities compared to fiscal 2015.
Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 17.2% for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with 17.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Sales and marketing and
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues were 16.6% for fiscal 2016, compared with 17.1%
for ﬁscal 2015. We continuously monitor these costs and implement cost-management actions, as appropriate. For
ﬁscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 40 basis
points principally due to improved operational efﬁciency in our business development activities, and General and
administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues decreased 10 basis points.
Operating expenses in fiscal 2015 included a Pension settlement charge of $64 million related to lump sum cash
payments made from our US. defined beneﬁt pension plan to former employees who elected to receive such payments.
