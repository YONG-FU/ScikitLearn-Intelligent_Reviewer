10. RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS
Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans
In the United States and certain other countries, the Company maintains and administers deﬁned benefit
retirement plans and postretirement medical plans for certain current, retired and resigned employees. In addition, the
Company’s U.S. defined beneﬁt pension plans include a frozen plan for former pre-incorporation partners, which is
unfunded. Benefits under the employee retirement plans are primarily based on years of service and compensation
during the years immediately preceding retirement or termination of participation in the plan. The deﬁned beneﬁt
pension disclosures include the Company’s US. and material non-U.S. defined beneﬁt pension plans.
Assumptions
The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the defined benefit pension obligations as of August 31
and the net periodic pension expense were as follows:
Pension Plans Postretirement Plans

Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest cost
components of net periodic pension expense. Historically, the Company selected a discount rate for the US. plans by
matching the plans’ cash flows to that of the average of two yield curves that provide the equivalent yields on zero-
coupon corporate bonds for each maturity. The discount rate assumption for the non-U.S. Plans primarily reflected the
market rate for high-quality, ﬁxed-income debt instruments. Beginning in ﬁscal 2016, the Company utilized a full yield
curve approach to estimate these components by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the
determination of the beneﬁt obligation to the relevant projected cash ﬂows. The Company made this change to improve
the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a
more precise measurement of service and interest costs. This change does not affect the measurement of the
Company’s total benefit obligations. The Company accounted forthis change as a change in estimate and, accordingly,
recognized its effect prospectively beginning in ﬁscal 2016.
The discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of the beneﬁt payments for each of the
Company’s defined beneﬁt pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and are subject to
change each year.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets should, over time, approximate the actual long-term returns
on defined benefit pension and postretirement plan assets and is based on historical returns and the future expectations
for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the asset portfolio.
