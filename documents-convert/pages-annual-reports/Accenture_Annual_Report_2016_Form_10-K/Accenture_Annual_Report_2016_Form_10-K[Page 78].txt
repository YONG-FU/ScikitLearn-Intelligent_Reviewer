Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement
In August 2016, the Company early adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which amends existing
guidance on income taxes to require the classiﬁcation of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the
balance sheet. The Company adopted this ASU using the retrospective method which required reclassiﬁcation of
current deferred taxes as previously reported on the Company’s August 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheets to
non-current, resulting in an increase to non—current deferred tax assets of $815,909 and a decrease to noncurrent
deferred tax liabilities of $22,218.
New Accounting Pronouncements
On March 31, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting, which simpliﬁes the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The new guidance requires excess
tax beneﬁts and tax deﬁciencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. In
addition, the ASU includes provisions that impact the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the
classiﬁcation of excess tax beneﬁts on the cash ﬂow statements. The Company will early adopt the standard effective
September 1, 2016. Following adoption, the primary impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements will
be the recognition of excess tax beneﬁts in the provision for income taxes rather than Additional paid-in capital, which
will likely result in increased volatility in the reported amounts of income tax expense and net income. The Company
estimates this change will reduce its fiscal 2017 effective tax rate by less than two percentage points. The actual impact
of adopting this standard on the effective tax rate will vary depending on the Company’s share price during ﬁscal 2017.
Provisions of the new guidance related to changes to classification of excess tax beneﬁts in the cash ﬂow statements
are expected to be adopted retrospectively. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impacts of the adoption of this
guidance and its preliminary assessments are subject to change.
On March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of
Accounting, which eliminates the requirement to retrospectively apply equity method accounting when an entity
increases ownership or influence in a previously held investment. The ASU will be effective forthe Company beginning
September 1, 2017, including interim periods in its ﬁscal year 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of
this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends existing guidance to require
lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by long-term
leases and to disclose additional quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The ASU will
be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2019, including interim periods in its ﬁscal year 2020, and allows
for a modified retrospective method upon adoption. The Company is assessing the impact of this ASU on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of
ﬁnancial instruments. The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2018, including interim
periods in its fiscal year 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on
its Consolidated Financial Statements.
