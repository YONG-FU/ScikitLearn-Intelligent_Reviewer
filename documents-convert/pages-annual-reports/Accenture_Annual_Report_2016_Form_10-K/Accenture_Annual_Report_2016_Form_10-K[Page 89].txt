The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax beneﬁts in the Provision for income
taxes. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized expense (beneﬁt) of $8,681, $(17,373) and $16,370
in interest and penalties, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $109,269
($95,057, net of tax beneﬁts) and $101 ,843 ($84,530, net of tax beneﬁts) were reﬂected on the Company’s Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company is participating in the US. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program
(“CAP”) beginning with the 2016 ﬁscal year. As part of CAP, tax years are audited on a contemporaneous basis so that
all or most issues are resolved prior to the ﬁling of the tax return. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for
ﬁscal 2013 and 2014. The Company is also currently under audit in numerous state and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.
Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain and could result in signiﬁcant cash tax payments, the Company
does not believe the outcome of these audits will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial
position or results of operations. V\ﬁth limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax audits by
taxing authorities for the years before 2007. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized
tax beneﬁts could decrease by approximately $562,000 or increase by approximately $169,000 in the next 12 months
as a result of settlements, lapses of statutes of limitations and other adjustments. The majority of these amounts relate
to transfer pricing matters in both US. and non-U.S. taxjurisdictions.
