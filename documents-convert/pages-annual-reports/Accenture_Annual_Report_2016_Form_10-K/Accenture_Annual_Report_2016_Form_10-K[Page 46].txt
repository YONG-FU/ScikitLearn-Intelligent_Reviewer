We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income
during fiscal 2016 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during ﬁscal 2016, each operating group
experienced higher costs associated with acquisition activity. The commentary below provides insight into other factors
affecting operating group performance and operating margin for ﬁscal 2016 compared with ﬁscal 2015, exclusive of
the Pension settlement charge recorded in ﬁscal 2015:
- Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to higher contract profitability
and consulting revenue growth.
- Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth.
- Health & Public Service operating income increased due to revenue growth and higher contract profitability.
