Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market
for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use
in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements
are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while
unobservable inputs reﬁectthe Company’s market assumptions. The fair-value hierarchy requires the use of observable
market data when available and consists of the following levels:
- Level 1—Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
- Level 2—Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all signiﬁcant inputs are
observable in active markets; and
- Level 3—Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more signiﬁcant inputs are
unobservable.
