Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, available cash reserves and debt capacity
available under various credit facilities. In addition, we could raise additional funds through public or private debt or
equity financings. We may use our available or additional funds to, among other things:
- facilitate purchases, redemptions and exchanges of shares and pay dividends;
- acquire complementary businesses or technologies;
- take advantage of opportunities, including more rapid expansion; or
- develop new services and solutions.
As ofAugust 31, 2016, Cash and cash equivalents were $4.9 billion, compared with $4.4 billion as ofAugust 31,
2015.
Cash flows from operating, investing and ﬁnancing activities, as reﬂected in our Consolidated Cash Flows
Statements, are summarized in the following table:

Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 545 $ (561) $ (711)_$ 1,105
Amounts in table may not total due to rounding.
Operating activities: The year-over-year increase in operating cash ﬂow was primarily driven by revenue growth
and higher operating income, as well as higher collections on net client balances (receivables from clients, current
and non—current unbilled services and deferred revenues), partially offset by other changes in operating assets and
liabilities, including higher spending on certain compensation payments.
Investing activities: Cash used in investing activities decreased $560 million year-over-year, as higher spending
on business acquisitions, investments and property and equipment was more than offset by proceeds of $815 million
from the Navitaire divestiture and Duck Creek partial divestiture. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business
Combinations and Divestitures) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data.”
Financing activities: The $195 million increase in cash used in ﬁnancing activities was primarily due to an
increase in the net purchases of shares and an increase in cash dividends paid. For additional information, see Note
13 (Material Transactions Affecting Shareholders’ Equity) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8,
“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
We believe that our available cash balances and the cash ﬂows expected to be generated from operations will
be sufﬁcient to satisfy our current and planned working capital and investment needs for the next twelve months. We
also believe that our longer-term working capital and other general corporate funding requirements will be satisﬁed
through cash flows from operations and, to the extent necessary, from our borrowing facilities and future ﬁnancial
market activities.
Substantially all of our cash is held in jurisdictions where there are no regulatory restrictions or material tax effects
on the free flow of funds. Domestic cash inflows for our Irish parent, principally dividend distributions from lower-tier
subsidiaries, have been sufﬁcient to meet our historic cash requirements, and we expect this to continue into the future.
