Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace and compete with a variety of
organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer. Our competitors include:
- large multinational providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers (hardware,
equipment and software), that offer some or all of the services and solutions that we do;
- off-shore service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India, that offer services globally that are
similar to the services and solutions we offer;
- accounting ﬁrms that provide consulting and other services and solutions in areas that compete with us;
- niche solution or service providers or local competitors that compete with us in a specific geographic market,
industry segment or service area, including digital agencies and emerging start-ups and other companies that
can scale rapidly to focus on certain markets and provide new or alternative products, services or delivery
models; and
- in-house departments of large corporations that use their own resources, rather than engage an outside ﬁrm
for the types of services and solutions we provide.
Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies, medium-sized
companies, governments, government agencies and other enterprises. We believe that the principal competitive factors
in the industries in which we compete include:
- skills and capabilities of people;
- technical and industry expertise;
- innovative service and product offerings;
- ability to add business value and improve performance;
- reputation and client references;
- contractual terms, including competitive pricing;
- ability to deliver results reliably and on a timely basis;
- scope of services;
- service delivery approach;
- quality of services and solutions;
- availability of appropriate resources; and
- global reach and scale, including level of presence in key emerging markets.
Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis.
Intellectual Property
We provide value to our clients based in part on a differentiated range of proprietary inventions, methodologies,
software, reusable knowledge capital and other intellectual property. We recognize the increasing value of intellectual
property in the marketplace and create, harvest, and protect this intellectual property. We leverage patent, trade secret,
copyright and trademark laws as well as contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property. We have also
established policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as our clients, partners and others.
