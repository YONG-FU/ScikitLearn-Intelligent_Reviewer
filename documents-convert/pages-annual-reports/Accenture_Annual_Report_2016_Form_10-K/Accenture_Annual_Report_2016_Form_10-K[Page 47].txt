- Products operating income increased due to very signiﬁcant consulting revenue growth and lower sales and
marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
- Resources operating income decreased due to lower outsourcing contract profitability, partially offset by lower
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
Other Expense, net
Other expense, net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses as well as gains and losses associated
with our investments in privately held companies. During ﬁscal 2016, Other expense, net increased $25 million over
ﬁscal 2015, primarily due to higher net foreign exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the
Nigerian Naira.
Gain on Sale of Businesses
We recorded a gain from the Navitaire divestiture of $548 million and a gain from the Duck Creek partial divestiture
of $301 million during ﬁscal 2016. For additional information, see Note 5 (Business Combinations and Divestitures) to
our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 22.4%, compared with 25.8% for fiscal 2015. Absent the $849 million
Gain on sale of businesses and related $104 million in taxes recorded during ﬁscal 2016, the effective tax rate for fiscal
2016 would have been 24.2%. Absent the $64 million Pension settlement charge and related $25 million in taxes
recorded during ﬁscal 2015, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The effective tax rate for
ﬁscal 2016 beneﬁted from a ﬁnal determination of US. Federal taxes for fiscal 2012. The effective tax rate for fiscal
2015 benefited from a ﬁnal determination of US. Federal taxes for ﬁscal years 2010 and 2011. This was offset by
expenses associated with an increase in deferred tax liabilities during fiscal 2015, when we concluded that certain
undistributed earnings of our US. subsidiaries would no longer be considered indeﬁnitely reinvested. For additional
information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.”
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable to
the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees
have in our Accenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational
Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders ofAccenture
plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to
noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for ﬁscal 2016 increased $18 million, or 8%, over ﬁscal 2015.
The increase was due to higher Net income of $1,076 million, primarily driven by the Gain on sale of businesses,
partially offset by a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc.
exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest during ﬁscal 2016.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $6.45 for fiscal 2016, compared with $4.76 for fiscal 2015. The $1.69 increase
in our Diluted earnings per share included the impact of the Gain on sale of businesses, net of taxes, which increased
Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 by $1.11 and the impact of the Pension settlement charge, net of taxes,
which decreased Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding these impacts, Diluted earnings per
share for fiscal 2016 increased $0.52 compared with fiscal 2015, due to increases of $0.34 from higher revenues and
operating results, $0.13 from a lower effective tax rate and $0.08 from lower weighted average shares outstanding.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 from higher non-operating expense. For information
regarding our Earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial
Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
