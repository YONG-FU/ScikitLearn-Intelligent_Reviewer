Other expense, net for ﬁscal 2015 increased $29 million over ﬁscal 2014, primarily due to higher net foreign
exchange losses, including losses incurred on the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for ﬁscal 2015 was 25.8%, compared with 26.1% for ﬁscal 2014. Absent the tax impact of
the $64 million Pension settlement charge recorded during the third quarter of ﬁscal 2015, the effective tax rate for
ﬁscal 2015 would have been 26.0%. The fiscal 2015 tax rate includes higher beneﬁts related to ﬁnal determinations
of tax liabilities for prior years, including a $170 million benefit related to ﬁnal settlement of US. tax audits for ﬁscal
years 2010 and 2011, and benefits related to changes in the geographic distribution of earnings, offset by an increase
in withholding taxes payable on the distribution of US. earnings. For additional information, see Note 9 (Income Taxes)
to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests reflects the income earned or expense incurred attributable
to the equity interest that some current and former members of Accenture Leadership and their permitted transferees
have in ourAccenture Holdings plc and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. subsidiaries. See “Business—Organizational
Structure.” Net income attributable to Accenture plc represents the income attributable to the shareholders ofAccenture
plc. Since January 2002, noncontrolling interests has also included immaterial amounts primarily attributable to
noncontrolling shareholders in our Avanade Inc. subsidiary.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for ﬁscal 2015 decreased $14 million, or 6%, from ﬁscal 2014.
The decrease was due to a reduction in the Accenture Holdings plc ordinary shares and Accenture Canada Holdings
Inc. exchangeable shares average noncontrolling ownership interest, partially offset by higher Net income of $98 million
for ﬁscal 2015.
Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $4.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with $4.52 for fiscal 2014. The $0.24 increase
in our diluted earnings per share included the impact of the $64 million Pension settlement charge, which decreased
diluted earnings per share for ﬁscal 2015 by $0.06. Excluding the impact of this charge, diluted earnings per share for
ﬁscal 2015 increased $0.30 compared with fiscal 2014, due to increases of $0.22 from higher revenues and operating
results, $0.09 from lower weighted average shares outstanding and $0.01 from a lower effective tax rate. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.02 from lower non-operating income. For information regarding our
earnings per share calculations, see Note 2 (Earnings Per Share) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under
