NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
(In thousands of US. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)
Assumed US. Health Care Cost Trend
The Company’s U.S. postretirement plan assumed annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of health care
beneﬁts is 6.8% for the plan year ending June 30, 2017. The rate is assumed to decrease on a straight-line basis to
4.5% for the plan year ending June 30, 2027 and remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage point increase in
the assumed health care cost trend rates would increase the beneﬁt obligation by $81,422, while a one percentage
point decrease would reduce the beneﬁt obligation by $62,615.
U.S. Defined Benefit Pension Plan Settlement Charge
During ﬁscal 2015, the Company offered a voluntary one-time lump sum payment option to certain eligible former
employees who had vested beneﬁts under the Company’s U.S. pension plan that, if accepted, would settle the
Company’s pension obligations to them. This resulted in lump sum payments from plan assets of $279,571 during
ﬁscal 2015. As a result of this settlement and the adoption of the new US. mortality tables released by the Society of
Actuaries, the Company remeasured the assets and liabilities of the US. pension plan, which in aggregate resulted
in a net reduction to the projected beneﬁt obligation of $179,938 as well as a non-cash settlement charge of $64,382,
pre-tax, during ﬁscal 2015.
Pension and Postretirement Expense
Pension expense for ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $94,827, $143,968 (including the above noted settlement
charge) and $87,422, respectively. Postretirement expense for ﬁscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was not material to the
Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
