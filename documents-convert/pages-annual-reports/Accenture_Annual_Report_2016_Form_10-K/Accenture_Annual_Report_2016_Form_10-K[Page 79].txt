ACCENTURE PLC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (continued)
(In thousands of US. dollars, except share and per share amounts or as otherwise disclosed)
On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Accounting Standard Codiﬁcation 606), Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in US. GAAP. The core
principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue forthe transfer of goods or services equal to the amount
that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. The ASU requires additional disclosure about the
nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash ﬂows arising from customer contracts, including signiﬁcant
judgments and changes in judgments. The ASU will be effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2018,
including interim periods in its ﬁscal year 2019, and allows for both retrospective and modiﬁed retrospective methods
of adoption. The Company will adopt the guidance on September 1, 2018 and apply the modified retrospective method.
The Company is assessing the impact of this ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
