We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our Operating income
during fiscal 2015 was similar to that disclosed for Net revenue. In addition, during ﬁscal 2015, each operating group
recorded a portion of the $64 million Pension settlement charge. The commentary below provides insight into other
factors affecting operating group performance and operating margin forfiscal 2015, exclusive of the Pension settlement
charge, compared with ﬁscal 2014:
- Communications, Media & Technology operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth and lower
sales and marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues.
- Financial Services operating income increased primarily due to consulting revenue growth, lower sales and
marketing costs as a percentage of net revenues and higher contract proﬁtability.
- Health & Public Service operating income increased due to outsourcing revenue growth.
- Products operating income increased due to higher contract profitability and consulting revenue growth.
