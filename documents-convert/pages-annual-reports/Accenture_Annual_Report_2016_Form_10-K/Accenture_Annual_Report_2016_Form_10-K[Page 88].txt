The Company recorded valuation allowances of $1,243,207 and $1,229,146 as of August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, against deferred tax assets principally associated with certain tax credit and tax net operating loss
carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. For all other
deferred tax assets, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2016, the Company recorded a net increase
of $14,061 in the valuation allowance. The majority of this change related to valuation allowances on certain tax net
operating loss carryforwards, as the Company believes it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized.
