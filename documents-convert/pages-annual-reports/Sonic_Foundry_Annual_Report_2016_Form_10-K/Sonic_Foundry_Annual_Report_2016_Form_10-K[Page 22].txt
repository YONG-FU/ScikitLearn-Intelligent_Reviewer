(1) Sonic grants employee stock options with exercise prices equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant.
(2) The amount reported in column (1) represents the grant date fair value of the award following the required F ASB
ASC Topic 718 compensation methodology. Grant date fair value is calculated using the Lattice method. See Note
1, “Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Sonic’s
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 for an explanation of the methodology and assumptions
used in F ASB ASC Topic 718 valuation. With respect to the option grants, there can be no assurance that the options
will ever be exercised (in which case no value will be realized by the executive) or that the value on exercise will
equal the F ASB ASC Topic 718 value.
Sonic grants options to its executive officers under our employee stock option plans. As of September 30, 2016, options
to purchase a total of 1,602,822 shares were outstanding under the plans, and options to purchase 366,886 shares remained
available for grant thereunder.
