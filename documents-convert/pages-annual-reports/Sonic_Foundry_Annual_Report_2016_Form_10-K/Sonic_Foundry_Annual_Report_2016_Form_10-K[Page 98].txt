these outstanding warrants as of September 30, 2016 was 3.23 years. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the
lattice model and the same inputs as those used for valuing the Company’s stock option fair value. The fair value of the warrants
was $133 thousand at the date of issuance. The Company determined that the warrants are freestanding and do not fall within the
scope of ASC 480 or ASC 815. The warrants were recorded in conjunction with the stock issued.
See Note 3, Credit Arrangements for disclosures on additional warrants issued during fiscal 2015.
Per Share Computation
Basic earnings (loss) per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period, less shares that may be repurchased, and excludes any dilutive eﬁects of options and warrants. In periods where
the Company reports net income, diluted net income per share is computed using common equivalent shares related to outstanding
options and warrants to purchase common stock. The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net
income (loss). The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted weighted average shares used in the earnings
per share calculations:

RecentAccounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09,
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)”. The guidance substantially converges ﬁnal standards on revenue
recognition between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board providing a framework on addressing revenue
recognition issues and, upon its effective date, replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance, including industry-
speciﬁc guidance, in current US. generally accepted accounting principles. The FASB subsequently issued a one-year deferral
of the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under US. GAAP. In accordance with the
deferral, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Subsequently, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations" ("ASU 2016-08");
ASU 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing"
("ASU 2016-10"); and ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients" ("ASU 2016-12"). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU
2014-09. We are currently evaluating the timing of adopting and the related impact, if any, it may have on our financial statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs” (“ASU 2015-03”), which
amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the ﬁnancial statements. ASU 2015 -03 requires that debt issuance costs
related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt
liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are eﬁective
for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 ,
but early adoption is permitted. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
condensed consolidated financial statements.
