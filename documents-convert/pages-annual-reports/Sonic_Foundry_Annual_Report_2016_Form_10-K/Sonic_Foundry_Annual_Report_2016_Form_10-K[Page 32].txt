compliance, satisfactory internal or external audits, improvement of financial ratings, achievement of balance sheet or
income statement objectives, net cash provided from continuing operations, stock price appreciation, total shareholder
return, cost control, strategic initiatives, net operating profit after tax, pre-tax or after-tax income, cash ﬂow, or a
combination of one or more of these measures, which may be absolute in their terms or measured against or in
relationship to other companies comparably, similarly or otherwise situated. These performance measures may be
adjusted to exclude the effect of various events that may occur during the performance period, including: extraordinary
items and any other unusual or non-recurring items; discontinued operations; gains or losses on the dispositions of
discontinued operations; the cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles; the writedown of any asset; and
charges for restructuring and rationalization programs. In addition, such performance measures:
- may vary by participant and may be different for different performance awards;
- may be particular to a participant or the department, branch, line of business, subsidiary or
other unit in which the participant works and may cover such period as may be specified by
the Committee; and
° shall be set by the Committee within the time period prescribed by, and shall otherwise
comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the cash or
number of shares payable pursuant to performance awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation
under 162(m) of the Code, and the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable performance measures
except in the case of the death or disability of the participant or a change in control of the Company.
Awards that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under 162(m) of the Code may be based
on these or such other performance measures as the Committee may determine.
Adjustments and Recapitalz‘zation. In the event that any change is made to the shares of common stock issuable under
the Amended 2009 Plan, whether through merger, consolidation, stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary cash
dividend, recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or other similar event, then appropriate
adjustments will be made to (i) the maximum number and/or class of securities issuable under the Plan, (ii) the number
and/or class of securities and, if applicable, price per share in effect under each outstanding Award under the Plan,
and (iii) the maximum number of shares issuable to one individual in a calendar year under the Plan.
Change in Control Provisions. In the event of a change in control of the Company, outstanding Awards may be
assumed, continued or substituted by the successor corporation. If the successor corporation does not assume, continue
or substitute such Awards, then all Awards held by a participant, immediately prior to the effectiveness of the change
in control, will become fully vested and exercisable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a change in control, all outstanding Awards held by the participant will,
immediately prior to the effectiveness of the change in control, become vested and exercisable as to an additional
number of shares equal to the number of shares that would have become vested and exercisable on the date twelve
months after the effectiveness of the change in control. If the participant has been employed by the Company for less
than twelve months immediately prior to the change in control, the number of vested and exercisable shares will be
increased by the number of shares that would have become vested and exercisable on the date six months after the
consummation of the change in control. In addition, if, within six months following the change in control, the successor
corporation terminates the employment of a participant without cause, all Awards held by the participant will become
fully vested and exercisable.
Under the Amended 2009 Plan, a “change in control” generally means any of the following events: (i) a person (as
deﬁned by Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, as amended) becomes the beneficial owner of securities
representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; (ii) the
Company’s incumbent directors cease to constitute a majority of the Board; (iii) a consummated merger or
consolidation of the Company with any other corporation; or (iv) the stockholders approve a plan of liquidation or
dissolution or an agreement for the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.
