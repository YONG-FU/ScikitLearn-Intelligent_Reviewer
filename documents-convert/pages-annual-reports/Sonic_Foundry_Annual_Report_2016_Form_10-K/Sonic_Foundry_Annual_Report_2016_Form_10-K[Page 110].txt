Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2016
Beginning with an acquisition in ﬁscal year 2002, the Company has amortized Goodwill for tax purposes over a 15 year life. Tax
amortization is not applicable to the goodwill from the foreign acquisitions that took place during fiscal 2014 since the foreign
goodwill is non-deductible for US federal tax purposes.
The difference between the book and tax balance of certain of the company’s goodwill creates a deferred tax liability and an
annual tax expense. Because of the long term nature of the goodwill timing difference, tax planning strategies cannot be utilized
with respect to the deferred tax liability. The Company’s tax rate differs from the expected tax rate each reporting period as a
result of the aforementioned items. The balance of the Deferred Tax Liability was $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 and $4.3
million at September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company recorded a deferred tax liability related to the Customer Relationship
intangibles value acquired as part of the purchase of Sonic Foundry International BV and Mediasite K. The Company also
recorded tax expense related to the “step-up” gain on its original equity investment in Mediasite K. The Company has some
other temporary differences related to its Mediasite KK subsidiary.
In accordance with accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company has concluded that a reserve for income
tax contingencies is not necessary. The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters
in income tax expense. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015 and has not recognized any interest or penalties in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations for either of the twelve month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.
The Company is subject to taxation in the US, Netherlands, Japan and various state jurisdictions. All of the Company’s tax years
are subject to examination by the US ., Dutch, Japanese and state tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating
losses.
7. Savings Plan
The Company’s defined contribution 401(k) savings plan covers substantially all employees meeting certain minimum eligibility
requirements. Participating employees can elect to defer a portion of their compensation and contribute it to the plan on a pretax
basis. The Company may also match certain amounts and/or provide additional discretionary contributions, as defined. The
Company made matching contributions of $426 thousand and $402 thousand during the years ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The Company made no additional discretionary contributions during 2016 and 2015.
8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are recorded at cost and are not amortized but, instead, tested at
least annually for impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value.
The Company performs annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, and tested goodwill recognized in connection with the
acquisitions of Mediasite, Sonic Foundry International and Mediasite K and determined it was not impaired. For purposes of
the test, goodwill on the Company’s books is evaluated within three separate reporting units.
