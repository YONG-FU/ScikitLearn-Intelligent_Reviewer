(1) The option awards in column (f) represent the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB
ASC Topic 718 for stock options granted during the ﬁscal year. The assumptions and methodology used in
calculating the compensation expense of the option awards are provided in Sonic’s Form 10-K. See Note 1,
“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Sonic’s
Form 10-K. The amounts in this column represent value attributed to the awards at the date of grant and not
necessarily the actual value that will be realized by the executive. There can be no assurance that the options will
ever be exercised (in which case no value will be realized by the executive) or that the value on exercise will equal
the ASC Topic 718 value.
(2) The amounts in column (g) represent cash bonuses which were awarded for performance during the prior ﬁscal year
based on a pre-established formula.
(3) The amount shown under column (i) for the ﬁscal year 2016 includes Sonic ’s matching contribution under our 401(k)
plan of $9,021, $10,149 and $9,945 for Messrs Weis, Minor and Lipps. Mr. Minor receives $650 per month as a car
allowance of which the taxable personal portions were $7,150. Mr. Lipps receives a car allowance of $700 per
month of which there was no taxable personal portion. Mr. Weis received car and housing allowances totaling
$2,500 per month, of which there was no taxable personal portion.
