Economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.
Fiscal 2016 has continued to show some weakness in domestic markets and global uncertainties exist in many areas of focus for
us including the United Kingdom, Japan and the Middle East. Many of our customers rely on local, state or Federal government
funding, both domestically and international. Japan experienced a decline in its gross domestic product in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
While it appears Japanese government subsidies are again supporting growth in higher education, any future delay or elimination
of government programs will have a negative impact on our operations in Japan. Any continuing unfavorable economic conditions
could continue to negatively affect, our business, operating results or financial condition, which could in turn affect our stock
price. Weak economic conditions and the resulting impact on the availability of public funds along with the possibility of state
and local budget cuts and reduced university enrollment could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and services. In
addition, a prolonged economic downturn could cause insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of
customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company’s products and inability or delay of our channel partners and
other customers to pay accounts receivable owed to us.
Economic conditions may have a disproportionate effect on the sale of our products.
Many of our customers will look at the total A/V equipment and labor cost to outﬁt a typical conference room or lecture hall as
one amount for budgetary purposes. Consequently, although our products represent only a portion of the total cost, the cost of the
entire project of outﬁtting a room or conference hall may be considered excessive and may not survive budgetary constraints.
Alternatively, our resellers may modify their quotes to end customers by eliminating our products or substituting less expensive
products supplied by our competitors in order to win opportunities within budget constraints. Event service partners may similarly
suggest that customers eliminate recording and webcasting as a means of reducing event cost. Consequently, declines in spending
by government, educational or corporate institutions due to budgetary constraints may have a disproportionate impact on the
Company and result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
We may need to raise additional capital.
At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $1.8 million, $1.6 million of which was in our foreign operations. There was a remaining
amount of $2.3 million available under our line of credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank at September 30, 2016, with $1.6
million outstanding and a credit limit of $3.9 million in total. The Company has historically financed its operations primarily
through cash from sales of equity securities, and to a limited extent, cash from operations and through bank credit facilities. The
Company has a history of operating losses and while it generated cash from operations of $1.7 million and recorded adjusted
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("adjusted EBITDA") of $1 .0 million in fiscal 2016, the majority
of those proceeds went to repayment of debt. Our adjusted EBITDA measure additionally adds back stock compensation expense
from the SEC definition of EBITDA. While the Company expects to increase revenue in ﬁscal 2017 and manage expense growth
to a level less than anticipated growth in revenues, we cannot ensure that revenue will grow as anticipated and, if revenue is
determined to be growing at a rate less than anticipated, it may be too late to reduce expenses for fiscal 2017. If the funds held
