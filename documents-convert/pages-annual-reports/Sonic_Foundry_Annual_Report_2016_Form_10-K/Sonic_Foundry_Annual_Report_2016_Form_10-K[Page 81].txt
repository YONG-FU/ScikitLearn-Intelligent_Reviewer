For the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company’s foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of $939 thousand
compared to a loss of $701 thousand in the year ended September 30, 2015. The gain in fiscal 2016 is attributable to the
strengthening in the Japanese Yen and the Euro compared to the US dollar during the period as compared to fiscal 2015.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are its cash, revolving line of credit, and in fiscal 2016, cash from operating activities.
During fiscal 2016, the Company generated $1.7 million of cash from operating activities compared with $3.1 million of cash
used for operating activities in ﬁscal 2015. The increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the
Company’s reduced net loss and an increase in cash generated from decreased working capital, predominantly a decrease in
accounts receivable in ﬁscal 2016 rather than an increase recorded in fiscal 2015 .
Capital expenditures for property and equipment were $339 thousand in fiscal 2016 compared to $722 thousand in fiscal 2015.
The Company used $1.6 million of cash for financing activities during fiscal 2016, mainly as a result of net payments on the line
of credit and notes payable. The Company generated proceeds of $1.6 million in fiscal 2015 due to net proceeds on the line of
credit and proceeds from equity transactions, including issuance of common stock and warrants, and exercise of common stock
options.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had a $4.0 million revolving line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. The line of credit
bears interest at prime rate plus 1.25%. At September 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings were $1.6 million. The highest balance
on the line of credit during the year was $3.26 million. At September 30, 2016, there was a remaining amount of $2.3 million
available under the line of credit for advances. At September 30, 2015, outstanding borrowings were $1.4 million.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had $1.1 million of notes payable with Silicon Valley Bank and $1.3 million of notes
payable, net of warrant debt discounts, with PFG. At September 30, 2015, the Company had $1.9 million outstanding related to
notes payable with Silicon Valley Bank and $1.4 million of notes payable, net of warrant debt discounts, with PF G. The Company
used cash for a net $1.2 million in payments on notes during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 compared to cash used
for a net $558 thousand in payments on notes in the same period of fiscal 2015 . These amounts include payments on subordinated
notes payable as a result of the acquisitions completed in ﬁscal 2014. In connection with the Loan and Security Agreement and
Warrant with PF G, amortization expense of $71 thousand related to the debt discount was incurred as a non-cash interest expense
in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2015, amortization expense of $22 thousand was recorded related to the debt discount with PFG.
At September 30, 2016 approximately $1.6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.
The Company believes its cash position plus available resources is adequate to accomplish its business plan through at least the
next twelve months. We will likely evaluate operating and capital lease opportunities to finance equipment purchases in the future
and anticipate utilizing the Company’s revolving line of credit to support working capital needs. We may also seek additional
equity financing, or issue additional shares previously registered in our available shelf registration, although we currently have
no plans to do so.
