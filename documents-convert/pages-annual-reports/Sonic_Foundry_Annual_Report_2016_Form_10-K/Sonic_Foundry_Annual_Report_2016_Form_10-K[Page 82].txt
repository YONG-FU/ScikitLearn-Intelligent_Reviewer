ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Derivative Financial Instruments
Pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K, the Company, as a smaller reporting company, is not required to provide the information
required by this item.
Interest Rate Risk
Our cash equivalents, which consist of overnight money market funds, are subject to interest rate ﬂuctuations, however, we
believe this risk is minimal due to the short-term nature of these investments.
At September 30, 2016, $2.7 million of the Company’s $4.3 million in outstanding debt is variable rate. We do not expect that an
increase in the level of interest rates would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor our
positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are party to any of our financial transactions.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries in the Netherlands is the Euro and in Japan is the Japanese Yen. They are
subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Any increase or decrease in the exchange rate of the US. Dollar compared to the
Euro or Japanese Yen will impact our future operating results and financial position.
