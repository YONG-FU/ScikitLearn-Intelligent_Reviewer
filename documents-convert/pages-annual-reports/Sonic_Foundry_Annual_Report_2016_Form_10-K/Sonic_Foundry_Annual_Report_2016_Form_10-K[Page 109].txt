The Company has a $66 thousand and $124 thousand deferred tax asset at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, recorded
within the prepaid expenses and other current assets line on the consolidated balance sheet and is primarily related to net operating
losses of MSKK.
At September 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $95 million for US. Federal and
$43 million for state tax purposes. For Federal tax purposes, the carryforwards expire in varying amounts between 2019 and 2036.
For state tax purposes, the carryforwards expire in varying amounts between 2016 and 2035. Utilization of the Company’s net
operating loss may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal
Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss
carryforwards before utilization. In addition, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $418 thousand, which expire in varying amounts between 2019 and 2020.
The Company maintains an additional paid-in—capital (APIC) pool which represents the excess tax benefits related to share-based
compensation that are available to absorb future tax deficiencies. If the amount of future tax deficiencies is greater than the
available APIC pool, the Company records the excess as income tax expense in its consolidated statements of income. For fiscal
2016 and fiscal 2015, the Company had a sufficient APIC pool to cover any tax deficiencies recorded and as a result, these
deﬁciencies did not affect its results of operations. At September 30, 2016, the Company has $1.1 million of net operating loss
carry forwards for which a benefit would be recorded in APIC when realized.
Earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to US. taxation upon repatriation to the US. and the
Company’s tax provision reﬂects the related incremental US. tax except for certain foreign subsidiaries whose unremitted
earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized with regard to the remittance
of such earnings after MSKK and Sonic Foundry International BV acquisitions were completed. Because of the availability of
US. foreign tax credits, it is likely no US. tax would be due if such earnings were repatriated. At September 30, 2016, unremitted
earnings of $ 1 .4 million for foreign subsidiaries were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested.
