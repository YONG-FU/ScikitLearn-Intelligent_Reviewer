Restricted Stock Units. There are no immediate tax consequences of receiving an award of restricted stock units under
the Amended 2009 Plan. A grantee who is awarded restricted stock units will be required to recognize ordinary income
in an amount equal to the fair market value of shares issued to such grantee at the end of the restriction period or, if
later, the payment date. If we comply with the restrictions of Section 162(m) of the Code, we will be entitled to a tax
deduction in the same amount and generally at the same time as the grantee recognizes ordinary income.
Performance Awards. The award of a performance award will have no federal income tax consequences for us or the
grantee. The payment of the award is taxable to a grantee as ordinary income. If we comply with the restrictions of
Section 162(m) of the Code, we will be entitled to a tax deduction in the same amount and generally at the same time
as the grantee recognizes ordinary income.
Section 280(G). To the extent payments that are contingent on a change in control are determined to exceed certain
Code limitations, they may be subject to a 20% nondeductible excise tax and our deduction with respect to the
associated compensation expense may be disallowed in whole or in part.
Section 409A. The Company intends for awards granted under the Amended 2009 Plan to comply with Section 409A
of the Code.
New Plan Beneﬁts
Because the Amended 2009 Plan will not be effective unless and until it is approved by the stockholders, no Awards
will be granted under the 2009 Plan in excess of the current share limit until approved. The participants and types of
Awards under the Amended 2009 Plan are subject to the discretion of the Committee and, as a result, the benefits or
amounts that will be received by any participant or groups of participants if the Amended 2009 Plan is approved are
currently not determinable. As of January 10, 2017 there were three executive officers, four non-employee directors,
and approximately 135 employees who are eligible to participate in the Amended 2009 Plan. As of the Record Date,
the closing price per share of our common stock was $4.95.
General
The amendment of the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan requires the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled
to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR proposal 5, to amend the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
PROPOSAL SIX: PROPOSAL TO AMEND THE
2008 SONIC FOUNDRY NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Board of Directors recommends amending the 2008 Sonic Foundry Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan
(the “2008 Plan”) by increasing the shares that may be issued pursuant to the plan from 100,000 to 150,000 (the
“Amended Directors Stock Option Plan”).
The purpose of the Amended Directors Stock Option Plan is to promote the interests of Sonic and its stockholders by
strengthening Sonic’s ability to attract and retain experienced and knowledgeable non-employee directors and to
encourage them to acquire an increased proprietary interest in Sonic. The Amended Directors Stock Option Plan is
intended to increase the number of shares pursuant to the plan in order to provide sufficient shares for further grants.
The 2008 Plan provided for the grant of up to 100,000 stock options, of which 101,500 were granted under the plan
and 8,000 expired, leaving a balance of 6,500 available for grant.
