granted options for 1,613,111 shares and had forfeitures totaling 210,143, leaving a balance of 397,032. During the
quarter ended December 31, 2016, the Company granted options for 300,270 shares under the 2009 Plan and cancelled
2,974 options, leaving a balance at December 31, 2016 of 99,736. We recommend approval of the Amended 2009
Plan to provide for an aggregate number of shares that may be subject to awards under the Amended 2009 Plan of
2,700,000.
We presently anticipate that the number of Available Shares under the Amended 2009 Plan will be sufficient for
issuance of awards under our equity compensation for three years. Except with respect to the number of shares of
common stock subject to equity awards, there are no material differences between the prior 2009 Stock Incentive Plan
and the Amended 2009 Plan.
Why You Should Vote for the Amended 2009 Plan
There are a Limited Number of Options Remaining to be Granted Under the 2009 Plan
Equity awards are currently made to officers and employees exclusively from our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan. As of
December 31, 2016, we had a balance of 99,736 options remaining to be granted under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.
We currently grant approximately 300,000 options per year. If we do not adopt the Amended 2009 Plan we will be
unable to issue a significant number of equity awards unless our stockholders approve a new stock plan. We anticipate
that we will have difficulty attracting, retaining, and motivating officers and employees if we were unable to make
equity awards to them. In addition, we believe that equity awards are an effective compensation vehicle because they
offer significant potential value with a smaller impact on current income and cash ﬂow. Therefore, we are asking our
stockholders to approve the Amended 2009 Plan.
Equity Incentives are an Important Part of our Compensation Philosophy
Approval of the Amended 2009 Plan is critical to our ongoing effort to create stockholder value. As discussed in the
Compensation Discussion and Analysis earlier in this Proxy Statement, equity-based incentives are an integral part of
our compensation program. We grant stock options to substantially all of our employees. We believe we must continue
to offer a competitive equity compensation plan in order to attract, retain and motivate the talent necessary to
successfully grow the Company.
The Amended 2009 Plan Combines Compensation and Governance Best Practices
Some of the key features of the Plans that are designed to protect our stockholders” interest and to reﬂect corporate
governance best practices are as follows:
° Continued broad-based eligibility for equity awards. We grant equity awards to
substantially all of our employees. By doing so, we link employee interests with stockholder
interests throughout the organization and motivate our employees to act as owners of the
Company.
- Reasonable share counting provisions. In general, when awards granted under the Plans
expire or are cancelled, the shares reserved for those awards will be returned to the share
reserve and be available for future issuance under the Plans. However, shares of common
stock received from the exercise of stock options or withheld for taxes will not be returned
to the share reserve.
° Option exercise price. Under the Amended 2009 Plan, the exercise price per share of stock
options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant.
- Repricing is not allowed. Under the Amended 2009 Plan, repricing of stock options
(including reduction in the exercise price of stock options or replacement of an award with
cash or another award type) is prohibited without prior stockholder approval.
