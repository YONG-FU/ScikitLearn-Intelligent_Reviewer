Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2016
Our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.
International product and service billings ranged from 38% to 41% of our total billings in each of the past two years and are
expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our business in the future, particularly as a result of growth in the
operations of businesses acquired in fiscal 2014 in the Netherlands and Japan. International sales are subject to a variety of risks,
including:
- Difficulties in establishing and managing international subsidiaries, distribution channels and operations;
- Difficulties in selling, servicing and supporting overseas products, translating products into foreign languages and
compliance with local hardware requirements;
- Difficulties in managing the demands of large international deployments, many of which distract key sales personnel from
opportunities in other parts of the world;
- Challenges associated with management transition;
- Challenges related to language or cultural differences;
- The uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries, such as China, relating to the protection of intellectual
property or requirements for product certification, protection of personal data or other restrictions;
- Competitive pressure impacting other parts of the world;
- Multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures;
- Currency and exchange rate ﬂuctuations;
- Diﬁiculties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries, including complexities in documenting letters of
credit;
- Economic or political changes in international markets;
- Restrictions on access to the Internet; and
- Diﬁiculty in complying with international employment related requirements
We may need to make acquisitions or form strategic alliances or partnerships in order to remain competitive in our market,
and recent acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships, including the acquisition of Mediasite KK and Sonic Foundry
International, could be difﬁcult to integrate, disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.
We completed the acquisitions of Mediasite KK in Japan and MediaMission (now Sonic Foundry International) in the Netherlands
in fiscal 2014. As a result of these acquisitions, we are integrating products, services, dispersed operations, management systems
and very different cultures. In the future, we may acquire or form strategic alliances or partnerships with other businesses in order
to remain competitive or to acquire new technologies. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:
- The potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;
- Difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;
- Diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;
- Risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market
positions;
- Potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential ﬁnancial and credit risks associated with acquired
customers;
- Potential loss of key employees;
- Inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;
- The inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;
- The diﬁiculty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards
consistent with our other services for such technology;
- Potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;
- Unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;
