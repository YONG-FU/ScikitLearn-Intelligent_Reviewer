The Company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) under which an aggregate of 150,000 common shares
may be issued. The Shareholders approved an amendment to increase the number of shares of common stock subject to the plan
from 100,000 to 150,000 at the Company’s annual meeting in March 2014. All employees who have completed 90 days of
employment with the Company on the first day of each offering period and customarily work twenty hours per week or more are
eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan. An employee who, after the grant of an option to purchase, would hold common stock
and/or hold outstanding options to purchase stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of the
Company will not be eligible to participate. Eligible employees may make contributions through payroll deductions of up to 10%
of their compensation. No participant in the Purchase Plan is permitted to purchase common stock under the Purchase Plan if
such option would permit his or her rights to purchase stock under the Purchase Plan to accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 of
the fair market value of such shares, or that exceeds 1,000 shares, for each calendar year. The Company makes a bi-annual offering
to eligible employees of options to purchase shares of common stock under the Purchase Plan on the first trading day of January
and July. Each offering period is for a period of 6 months from the date of the offering, and each eligible employee as of the date
of offering is entitled to purchase shares of common stock at a purchase price equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value
of common stock on the first or last trading day of the offering period. A total of 23,708 shares are available to be issued under
