ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL
DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on evaluations at September 30, 2016, our principal executive ofﬁcer and principal ﬁnancial officer, with the participation
of our management team, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in Rules 13a—15
(e) and 15d-15 (e) under the Securities Exchange Act) and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under
the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive oﬂicer and our principal financial officer, as appr0priate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures.
Limitations on the effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Management’s Assessment
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human
error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
