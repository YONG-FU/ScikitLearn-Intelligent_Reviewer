Partners for Growth I K LP.
On May 13, 2015, Sonic Foundry, Inc., entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan and Security Agreement”) with
Partners for Growth IV, L.P. (“PFG”), (the “Loan and Security Agreement”).
The Loan and Security Agreement provides for a Term Loan in the amount of $2,000,000, which can be disbursed in two (2)
Tranches as follows: Tranche 1 was drawn in the amount of $1,500,000 shortly after execution thereof; and Tranche 2 in the
amount of $500,000, was drawn on December 15, 2015.
Each tranche of the Term Loan bears interest at 10.75% per annum. Tranche 1 of the Term Loan was payable interest only until
November 30, 2015. Beginning on December 1, 2015, principal is due in 30 equal monthly principal installments, plus accrued
interest, continuing until May 1, 2018, when the principal balance is to be paid in full. Tranche 2 of the Term Loan is payable in
29 equal monthly principal installments, plus accrued interest, beginning January 1, 2015 and continuing until May 1, 2018.
The principal of the Term Loan may be prepaid at any time after May 13, 2016 without a prepayment fee.
Coincident with execution of the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company entered into a Warrant Agreement (“Warrant”) with
PFG. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, the Company issued to PFG a warrant to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common
stock of the Company at an exercise price of $9.66 per share, subject to certain adjustments, of which 37,500 were exercisable
with the disbursement of Tranche 1 and 12,500 became exercisable with the disbursement under Tranche 2. Pursuant to the
Warrant, PFG is also entitled, under certain conditions, to require the Company to exchange the Warrant for the sum of $200,000.
Each warrant issued has an exercise term of 5 years from the date of issuance. On August 12, 2015, the Company and PFG entered
into a waiver agreement to waive a then existing covenant default and to change the exercise price of the aforementioned warrants
from $9.66 per share to $6.80 per share.
The warrants can be settled for cash in the event of acquisition of the company, any liquidation of the company, or expiration of
the warrant. The Company has determined the cash payment date to be the expiration date (May 14, 2020). Due to the fixed
payment amount on the expiration date, the warrant structure is in substance a debt arrangement (the “Warrant Debt”) with a zero
interest rate, a fixed maturity date and a feature that makes the debt convertible to common stock. The Warrant Debt had a fair
value of $58 thousand. The derivative had a fair value of $120 thousand. The conversion feature is an embedded derivative; thus,
for accounting purposes, the conversion feature is bifurcated and accounted for separately from the PF G Debt and Warrant Debt
as a derivative liability measured at fair value at each reporting period.
As of September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability associated with the warrants issued in connection
with the Loan and Security Agreement, was $67 thousand. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability between the
issuance date and September 30, 2016, was recorded as a gain of $69 thousand included in the other income (expense).
