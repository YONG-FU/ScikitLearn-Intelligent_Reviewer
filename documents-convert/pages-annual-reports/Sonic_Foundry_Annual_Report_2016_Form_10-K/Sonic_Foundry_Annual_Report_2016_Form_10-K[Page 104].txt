Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2016
The proceeds from the Loan and Security Agreement were allocated between the PF G Debt and the Warrant Debt (inclusive of
its conversion feature) based on their relative fair value on the date of issuance which resulted in initial carrying values of $1.322
million and $178 thousand, respectively. The conversion feature of $17 8 thousand is treated together as a debt discount on the
PF G Debt and will be accreted to interest expense under the effective interest method over the three-year term of the PFG Debt
and the five-year term of the Warrant Debt. For fiscal 2016, the Company recorded accretion of discount expenses associated
with the warrants issued with the PF G loan of $17 thousand as well as $71 thousand related to amortization of the debt discount.
For ﬁscal 2015, the Company recorded accretion of discount expense associated with the warrants issued with the PFG loan of
$5 thousand as well as $22 thousand related to amortization of the debt discount.
The fair values of term debt and warrant debt are based on the present value of expected future cash ﬂows and assumptions about
current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the Company (Level 3). At December 14, 2015, the carrying amounts of the
Company’s term debt and warrant debt totaled $1.322 million and $178 thousand, respectively. At December 14, 2015, the
Company’s term debt and warrant debt were recorded at fair value. At September 30, 2016, the derivative liability was remeasured
at fair value. The fair value of the bifurcated conversion feature represented by the warrant derivative liability is based on a Black
Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for stock price, exercise price, volatility, expected term, risk free interest rate and
dividend yield similar to those described previously for share-based compensation which were generally observable (Level 2).
