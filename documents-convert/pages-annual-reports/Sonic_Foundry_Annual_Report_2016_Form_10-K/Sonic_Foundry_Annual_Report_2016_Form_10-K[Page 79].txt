Operating Expenses
Selling and Marketing Expenses
Selling and marketing expenses include wages and commissions for sales, marketing and business development personnel, print
advertising and various promotional expenses for our products. Timing of these costs may vary greatly depending on introduction
of new products and services or entrance into new markets, or participation in major tradeshows.
Selling and marketing expense decreased $215 thousand, or 1%, from $18.0 million in ﬁscal 2015 to $17.8 million in ﬁscal 2016.
Fluctuations in the major categories include:
- Advertising and tradeshow expenses decreased $180 thousand.
° Overall costs allocated to selling & marketing decreased by $119 thousand, primarily as a result of a decrease in facilities
expenses (G&A) and an increase in selling & marketing expenses allocated to cost of goods sold.
- Selling and marketing expenses for Sonic Foundry International and MSKK accounted for $312 thousand and $2.8
million, respectively in ﬁscal 2016, an aggregate increase of $160 thousand from the prior year. The increase is mainly
due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal 2016.
