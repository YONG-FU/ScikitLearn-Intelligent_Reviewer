Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2016
Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value
The Company’s other ﬁnancial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable
and debt instruments, excluding the PFG debt. The book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt (excluding
the PF G debt) and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. The carrying value of
capital lease obligations and debt (excluding the PFG debt), including the current portion, approximates fair market value as the
variable and fixed rate approximates the current market rate of interest available to the Company.
Legal Contingencies
In June 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Astute Technology, LLC (“Astute”). The key terms of the
agreement were: 1) a grant of a non-revocable license of Astute patents to the Company; 2) a grant of a fully paid, non-refundable
license of certain Sonic Foundry patents to Astute; 3) both Astute and our customer agreed to identify three meetings they
currently capture that the other party will not seek or respond to any request for proposal; and 4) a payment of $1.35 million to
Astute. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the payments were made in three equal amounts with the first paid in June 2014,
the second paid in October 2014 and the ﬁnal installment paid in March 2015. The Company contributed $1.1 million of the
$1.35 million payable to Astute with our customer paying the residual amount. Of the $1.1 million, $428 thousand related to prior
use and was recorded as a charge to income during ﬁscal 2014. The remaining $672 thousand was recorded as a product right
asset, which is being amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the remaining life of the patents, through 2020. Future amounts due
to Astute were accrued for as of the time of settlement.
No legal contingencies were recorded for the either of the years ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company uses a lattice valuation model to account for all employee stock options granted. The lattice valuation model is a
more ﬂexible analysis to value options because of its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time, such as actual exercise
behavior of option holders. The Company uses historical data to estimate the option exercise and employee departure behavior
in the lattice valuation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company considers
all employees to have similar exercise behavior and therefore has not identified separate homogeneous groups for valuation. The
expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods the options are expected to be outstanding is based
on the US. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. F orfeitures are based on actual behavior patterns. The expected exercise
factor and forfeiture rates are calculated using historical exercise and forfeiture activity for the previous three years.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the assumptions in the following table:

Expected life 4.9 — 5.0 years 4.8 — 5.0 years
