Sonic Foundry, Inc.
Annual Report on Form 10-K
For the Year Ended September 30, 2016
the Company’s intangible assets and other long-lived assets are estimated when events or changes in circumstances such as market
value, asset utilization, physical change, legal factors, or other matters indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
In determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, the Company currently utilizes market data or other assumptions
that it believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market, and
adjusts for non-performance and/or other risk associated with the Company as well as counterparties, as appropriate. When
considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between
observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:
Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible
to the Company at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable
inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or
liability at measurement date.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1, as this level provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while giving the
lowest priority to Level 3.
Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The initial fair values of PF G debt and warrant debt (see Note 3) were based on the present value of expected future cash ﬂows
and assumptions about current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the Company (Level 3). The fair value of the bifurcated
conversion feature represented by the warrant derivative liability, which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis is based on
a Black Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for stock price, exercise price, volatility, expected term, risk free interest
rate and dividend yield similar to those described for share-based compensation which were generally observable (Level 2).
