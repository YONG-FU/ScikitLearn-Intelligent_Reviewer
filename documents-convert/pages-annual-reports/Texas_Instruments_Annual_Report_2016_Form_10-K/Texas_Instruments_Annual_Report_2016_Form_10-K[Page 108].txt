(1) Mr. Anderson does not participate in any of the company’s defined benefit pension plans because he joined Tl after these
plans were closed to new participants.
(2) In 1997, Tl’s U.S. employees were given the choice between continuing to participate in the defined benefit pension plans
or participating in a new enhanced defined contribution retirement plan. Messrs. Templeton and Crutcher chose to participate
in the defined contribution plan. Accordingly, their accrued pension benefits under the qualified and non-qualified plans were frozen
(i.e., they will experience no increase attributable to years of service or change in eligible earnings) as of December 31 , 1997.
Contributions to the defined contribution plan for Mr. Templeton’s and Mr. Crutcher’s benefits are included in the 2016 summary
compensation table.
(3) For each of the named executive officers, credited service began on the date the officer became eligible to participate in
the plan. For Mr. Crutcher, eligibility to participate began on the first day of the month following completion of one year of
employment. For each of the other named executive officers, eligibility to participate began on the earlier of 18 months of
employment, or January 1 following the completion of one year of employment. Accordingly, each of the named executive
officers has been employed by TI for longer than the years of credited service shown above.
(4) Credited service began on the date the named executive officer became eligible to participate in the TI Employees Pension
Plan as described in note 3 above and ceased at December 31, 2004.
'0
g (5) Credited service began on the date the named executive officer became eligible to participate in the TI Employees Pension
ﬁ Plan as described in note 3 above.
2'? (6) The assumptions and valuation methods used to calculate the present value of the accumulated pension benefits shown
I: are the same as those used by TI for financial reporting purposes and are described in Note 10 to the financial statements
:11 contained in Item 8 in Tl’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, except that a named executive
E officer’s retirement is assumed (in accordance with SEC rules) for purposes of this table to occur at age 65 and no
3 assumption for termination prior to that date is used. The amount of the lump-sum benefit earned as of December 31, 2016,
is determined using either (i) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) interest assumption of 1.25 percent or (ii) the
Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) corporate bond yield interest assumption of 4.29 percent for the TI Employees Pension
Plan and 4.33 percent for the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plans, whichever rate produces the higher lump-sum
amount. A discount rate assumption of 4.29 percent for the TI Employees Pension Plan and 4.33 percent for the non-qualified
pension plans was used to determine the present value of each lump sum.
