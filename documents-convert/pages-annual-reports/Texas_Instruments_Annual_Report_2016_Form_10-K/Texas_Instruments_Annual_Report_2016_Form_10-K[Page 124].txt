Appendix A
Non-GAAP reconciliations
This proxy statement refers to ratios based on free cash flow. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the US. (GAAP). Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated by subtracting
Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as
Cash flow from operations). We believe free cash flow and these ratios based on it provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-
generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial
performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures and are reconciled in the table
below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
