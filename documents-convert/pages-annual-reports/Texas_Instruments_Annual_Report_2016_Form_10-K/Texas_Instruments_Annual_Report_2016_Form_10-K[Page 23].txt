Operating expenses were $1.28 billion for R&D and $1.75 billion for 868A. R&D expense decreased $78 million, or 6 percent, and
868A decreased $95 million, or 5 percent. Both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align
costs with growth opportunities, including the completed restructuring actions in Embedded Processing and Japan. These
decreases were partially offset by higher compensation-related costs.
Acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of National Semiconductor and were $329 million, about even with 2014.
These non-cash charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets.
Restructuring charges/other was a net credit of $71 million, which included gains on sales of assets of $83 million that were
partially offset by $12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits. This compared with a net credit of $51 million in
2014, reflecting gains on sales of assets of $75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of ’5
$24 million. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. 3

Operating profit was $4.27 billion, or 32.9 percent of revenue, compared with $3.95 billion, or 30.3 percent of revenue, in 2014. 5

The income tax provision was $1.23 billion compared with $1.05 billion. The increase in the total tax provision was due to higher
income before income taxes and, to a lesser extent, a lower benefit from non-U.S. effective tax rates. Our effective tax rate was
29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014.
Net income was $2.99 billion, an increase of $165 million, or 6 percent, from 2014. EPS was $2.82 compared with $2.57 in 2014.
