The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of Deferred credits and other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
All of the $243 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016, is comprised of positions that, if recognized,
would benefit the effective tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized, $12 million of existing deferred tax assets would
also be realized, related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation.
All of the $84 million liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2015, is comprised of positions that, if recognized,
would benefit the effective tax rate. If these tax liabilities are ultimately realized, $12 million of existing deferred tax assets would
also be realized, related to refunds from counterparty jurisdictions resulting from procedures for relief from double taxation.
As of December 31, 2016, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2010 and following years.
Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2012 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty
procedures for relief from double taxation. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for
the years 2006 through 2011. .
ln non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to
majorjurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007.
7. Financial instruments and risk concentration
Financial instruments
We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not
material as of December 31, 2016. Our fonNard foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2016, had a
notional value of $494 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $158 million to sell Japanese
yen and $123 million to sell euros.
Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our postretirement plan
assets and deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and
liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.
The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2
inputs. See Note 8 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs.
Risk concentration
We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments
that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to
financial institutions with investment-grade ratings.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their
dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments,
incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
