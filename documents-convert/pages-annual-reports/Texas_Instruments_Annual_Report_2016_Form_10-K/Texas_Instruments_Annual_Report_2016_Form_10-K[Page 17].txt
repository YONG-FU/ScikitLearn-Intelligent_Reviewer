* Leased.
T Portions of the facilities are leased and owned. This may include land leases, particularly for our non-U.S. sites. â€˜
Our facilities in the United States contained approximately 13.1 million square feet at December 31, 2016, of which approximately
0.7 million square feet were leased. Our facilities outside the United States contained approximately 10.2 million square feet at
December 31, 2016, of which approximately 1.5 million square feet were leased.
At the end of 2016, we occupied substantially all of the space in our facilities.
Leases covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates, generally within the next five years. We believe our
current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended purpose and our current and foreseeable future needs.
ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.
We are involved in various inquiries and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that the amount
of our liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
