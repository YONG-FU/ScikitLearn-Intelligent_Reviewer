:1 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting
f units is in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value is based upon management estimates and judgment, using
9 unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable
5: inputs are considered Level 3 measurements, as described in Note 8. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we determined no impairment
was indicated.

Plan descriptions
We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans.
For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements.
U. S. retirement plans
0ur principal retirement plans in the U.S. are a defined contribution plan; an enhanced defined contribution plan; and qualified and
non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current
participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans, or to cease accruing a benefit
and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described below.
