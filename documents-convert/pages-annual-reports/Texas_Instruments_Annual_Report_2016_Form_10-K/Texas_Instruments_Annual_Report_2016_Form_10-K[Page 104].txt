(4) The company does not pay above-market earnings on deferred compensation. Therefore, no amounts are reported in this
column for deferred compensation. The amounts in this column represent the change in the actuarial value of the named
executive officers’ benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan (Tl Employees Pension Plan) and the non-qualified
defined benefit pension plans (T l Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan and TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II) from
December 31, 2015, through December 31, 2016. This “change in the actuarial value” is the difference between the 2015
and 2016 present value of the pension benefit accumulated as of year-end by the named executive officer, assuming that
benefit is not paid until age 65. Mr. Templeton’s and Mr. Crutcher’s benefits under the company’s pension plans were frozen
as of December 31, 1997. Mr. Anderson does not participate in any of the company’s defined benefit pension plans.

(ii) perquisites and personal benefits that meet the disclosure thresholds established by the SEC and are detailed in the
