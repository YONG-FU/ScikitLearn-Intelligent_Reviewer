Geographic area information
The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and
equipment, based on physical location. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the
end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where
our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may
include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the
world.

2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein, except for the
adoption of a new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to stock compensation, which includes certain
provisions applied prospectively. See Changes in accounting standards for further information.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share
amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior
periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2016 presentation, retrospectively applying certain provisions of the new
accounting standard related to stock compensation.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.
