8. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities
.ﬂ
g Debt and equity investments
.. We classify our investments as available for sale, trading, equity method or cost method. Most of our investments are classified as
‘5: available for sale.
Available-for-sale and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See
the fair-value discussion below. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an increase or
decrease, net of taxes, in AOCl on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record other-than-temporary impairments on
available-for-sale securities in Ol&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended
to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these
mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A.
Our other investments are not measured at fair value but are accounted for using either the equity method or cost method. These
investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from
equity-method investments are reflected in 0l&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Gains and losses
on cost-method investments are recorded in Ol&E when realized or when an impairment of the investment’s value is warranted
based on our assessment of the recoverability of each investment.
