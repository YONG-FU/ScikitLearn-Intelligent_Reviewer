The committee set the 2016 base-salary rate for each of the named executive officers in January 2016. In keeping with its
strategy, the committee set the annual base-salary rates to be below the estimated median level of salaries expected to be paid to
similarly situated executives (considering job scope and tenure) of companies within the Comparator Group in January 2016.
The salary differences between the named executive officers were driven primarily by the market rate of pay for each officer and
not the application of a formula designed to maintain a differential between the officers.
Equity compensation
In 2016, the committee awarded equity compensation to each of the named executive officers. The grants are shown in the table
under “Grants of plan-based awards in 2016.” The grant date fair value of the awards is reflected in that table and in the “Stock
Awards” and “Option Awards” columns of the 2016 summary compensation table. The table below is provided to assist the reader
in comparing the grant date fair values and number of shares for each of the years shown in the summary compensation table.

In January 2016, the committee awarded equity compensation to each of the named executive officers. The committee’s general
objective was to award to those officers equity compensation that had a grant date fair value at approximately the median market
level, in this case the 40th to 601h percentile of the three-year average of equity compensation (including an estimate of amounts for '2?
2016) granted by the Comparator Group. E
III
In assessing the market level, the committee considered information presented by Tl’s Compensation and Benefits organization '2
(prepared using data provided by the committee’s compensation consultant) on the estimated value of the awards expected to be '5
granted to similarly situated executives (considering job scope and tenure) of companies within the Comparator Group. The award ;
value was estimated using the same methodology used for financial accounting. 2
n.
For each officer, the committee set the desired grant value. The committee decided to allocate the value equally between restricted
stock units and options for each officer, to give equal emphasis to promoting retention, motivating the executive and aligning his
interests with those of shareholders.
Before approving the grants, the committee reviewed the amount of unvested equity compensation held by the officers to assess
its retention value. In making this assessment, the committee used its judgment and did not apply any formula, threshold or
maximum. This review did not result in an increase or decrease of the awards.
