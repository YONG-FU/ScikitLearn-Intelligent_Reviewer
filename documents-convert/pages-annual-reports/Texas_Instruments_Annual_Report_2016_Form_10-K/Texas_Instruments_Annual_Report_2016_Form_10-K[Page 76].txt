Attendance requirements
Attendance at the meeting is limited to stockholders or their legal proxy holders. Each attendee must present a government-issued
photo ID and proof of ownership (see table below) as of the record date. You are a record holder if you hold your shares through
our transfer agent, Computershare. You are a beneficial holder if you hold your shares through an intermediary, such as a bank or
a broker. If you are a beneficial holder and wish to vote your shares at the meeting, you must bring a legal proxy from your broker,
bank or nominee. Guest tickets are not available. Exceptions may be granted to stockholders who require a companion ticket in
order to facilitate their own attendance (for example, due to a physical disability) by contacting Investor Relations.

If you plan to attend as proxy for a stockholder of record, you must present a valid legal proxy from the stockholder of record to
you. If you plan to attend as proxy for a street name stockholder, you must present a valid legal proxy from the stockholder of
record (i.e., the bank, broker or other holder of record) to the street name stockholder that is assignable and a valid legal proxy
from the street name stockholder to you. Stockholders may appoint only one proxy holder to attend on their behalf.
