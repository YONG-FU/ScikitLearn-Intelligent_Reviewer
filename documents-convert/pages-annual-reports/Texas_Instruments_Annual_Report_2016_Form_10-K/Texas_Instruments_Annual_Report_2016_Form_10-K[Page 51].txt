Fair- value considerations ’5
0
We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price "
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for E
the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 2
The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level ofjudgment used to estimate fair-value measurements.
0 Level 1— Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date.
0 Level 2— Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through
correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices
in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing
methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest
rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide
Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or
dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets.
0 Level 3— Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant
management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates
of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities, other than ‘
certain assets held by our postretirement plans.
The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include
cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis
other than fair value.
