(5) SEC rules require the disclosure of earnings on deferred compensation to the extent that the interest rate exceeds a specified
rate (Federal Rate), which is 120 percent of the applicable federal long-term interest rate with compounding. Under the terms
of the Director Plan, deferred compensation cash amounts earn interest at a rate based on Moody’s Seasoned Aaa Corporate
Bonds. For 2016, this interest rate exceeded the Federal Rate by 1.74 percentage points. Shown is the amount of interest
earned on the directors’ deferred compensation accounts that was in excess of the Federal Rate.
