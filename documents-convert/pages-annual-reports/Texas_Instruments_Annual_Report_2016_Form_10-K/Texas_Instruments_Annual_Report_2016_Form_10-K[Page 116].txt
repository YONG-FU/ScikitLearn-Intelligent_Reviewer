Annually the independent registered public accounting firm and the director of internal audits present to the Audit Committee
services expected to be performed by the firm over the next 12 months. The Audit Committee reviews and, as it deems
appropriate, pre-approves those services. The services and estimated fees are presented to the Audit Committee for consideration
in the following categories: Audit, Audit-related, Tax and All Other (each as defined in Schedule 14A of the Securities Exchange
Act). For each service listed in those categories, the committee receives detailed documentation indicating the specific services to
be provided. The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically
provides for a different period. The Audit Committee reviews on at least a quarterly basis the services provided to date by the firm
and the fees incurred for those services. The Audit Committee may revise the list of pre-approved services and related fees from
time to time, based on subsequent determinations.
In order to respond to time-sensitive requests for services that may arise between regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit
Committee, the committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chair (the Audit Committee does not delegate to
management its responsibilities to pre-approve services). The Chair reports pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee and
seeks ratification of such decisions at the Audit Committee’s next scheduled meeting.
The Audit Committee or its Chair pre-approved all services provided by Ernst & Young during 2016.
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the company’s
independent registered public accounting firm for 2017.
