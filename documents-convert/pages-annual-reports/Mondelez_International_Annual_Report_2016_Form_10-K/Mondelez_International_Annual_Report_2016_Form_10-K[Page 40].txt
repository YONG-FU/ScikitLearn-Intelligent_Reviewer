Results of Operations by Reportable Segment
Our operations and management structure are organized into four reportable operating segments:
0 Latin America
0 AMEA
0 Europe
0 North America
On October 1, 2016, we integrated our EEMEA operating segment into our Europe and Asia Paciﬁc operating segments to further leverage and
optimize the operating scale built within the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Belarus, Georgia and Kazakhstan were
combined within our Europe operating segment, while the remaining Middle East and African countries were combined within our Asia Paciﬁc region
to form a new AMEA regional operating segment. We have reﬂected the segment change as if it had occurred in all periods presented.
We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively
and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product
categories and ﬁnancial results in the regions.
Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments were part of our base
business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for our new coffee equity method investment in JDE, we began to record
the earnings from our equity method investments in equity method investment earnings outside of segment operating income. For the six months
ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity
method investments through July 2, 2015 recorded within segment operating income were $52 million in AMEA and $4 million in North America. For
the year ended December 31, 2014 these earnings were $104 million in AMEA and $9 million in North America. See Note 1, Summary of Signiﬁcant
Accounting Policies — Principles of Consolidation, and Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, for additional information.
