Non-amortizable intangible assets consist principally of brand names purchased through our acquisitions of Nabisco Holdings Corp., the Spanish and
Portuguese operations of United Biscuits, the global LU biscuit business of Groupe Danone SA. and Cadbury Limited. Amortizable intangible assets
consist primarily of trademarks, customer-related intangibles, process technology, licenses and non-compete agreements. At December 31, 2016,
the weighted-average life of our amortizable intangible assets was 13.5 years.
Amortization expense for intangible assets was $176 million in 2016, $181 million in 2015 and $206 million in 2014. We currently estimate annual
amortization expense for each of the next ﬁve years to be approximately $171 million, estimated using December 31, 2016 exchange rates.

acquired trademarks and customer-related intangible assets. A preliminary goodwill balance was recorded in the third quarter of 2015
