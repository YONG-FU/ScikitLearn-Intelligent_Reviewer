For our U.S. plans, our investment strategy is to reduce the risk of underfunded plans in part through appropriate asset allocation within our plan
assets. We attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly beneﬁt
payments. The strategy involves using indexed U.S. equity and international equity securities and actively managed U.S. investment grade fixed-
income securities (which constitute 95% or more of ﬁxed-income securities) with smaller allocations to high yield ﬁxed-income securities.
For our non-U.S. plans, the investment strategy is subject to local regulations and the asset / liability proﬁles of the plans in each individual country.
In aggregate, the asset allocation targets of our non-U.S. plans are broadly characterized as a mix of approximately 34% equity securities (including
investments in real estate), approximately 64% ﬁxed-income securities and approximately 2% other alternative securities. Our investment strategy for
our largest non-U.S. plan, which comprises 63% of our non-U.S. pension assets, is designed to balance risk and return by diversifying across a wide
range of return-seeking and liability matching assets, invested in a range of both active and passive mandates. We target an allocation of
approximately 24% in equity securities, 21% credit, 6% private markets, 9% other diversifying assets, and 40% liability matching assets. The strategy
uses indexed global developed equities, actively managed global investment grade and alternative credit, global private equity and real estate, other
diversifying assets including hedge funds, and other liability matching assets including a buy-in annuity policy.
Employer Contributions:
In 2016, we contributed $378 million (of which, $350 million was voluntarily contributed) to our U.S. pension plans and $403 million (of which,
$100 million was a non-recurring contribution related to merging our legacy Cadbury plans in the United Kingdom) to our non-U.S. pension plans. In
addition, employees contributed $16 million to our non-U.S. plans. We make contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans primarily to the
extent that they are tax deductible and do not generate an excise tax liability.
In 2017, we estimate that our pension contributions will be $13 million to our U.S. plans and $455 million to our non-U.S. plans based on current tax
laws. Of the total 2017 pension contributions, $250 million is expected to be non-recurring. Our actual contributions may be different due to many
factors, including changes in tax and other beneﬁt laws, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest
rates.
Future Beneﬁt Payments:
The estimated future beneﬁt payments from our pension plans at December 31, 2016 were (in millions):
Year ending; 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022-2026
lU.S. Plans $ 89 $ 97 $ 103 $ 107 $ 108 $ 568 l
Non-U.S. Plans 357 356 363 378 400 2,138
Multiemployer Pension Plans:
In accordance with obligations we have under collective bargaining agreements, we made contributions to multiemployer pension plans of $25 million
in 2016, $31 million in 2015 and $32 million in 2014. There are risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans that are different from single
employer plans. Assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide beneﬁts to employees of other participating
employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating
employers. If the Company stops participating in its multi-employer pension plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount
based on its allocable share of the unfunded vested beneﬁts of the plans, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
