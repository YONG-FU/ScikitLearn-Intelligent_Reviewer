(1) Includes approximately $325 million of basis differences between the US. GAAP accounting basis for our equity method investments and the US. GAAP
accounting basis of our investees’ equity.
(2) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base
business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method
investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. For the six months ended December 31, 2015, after-tax equity
method investment net earnings were less than $1 million on a combined basis. Earnings from equity method investments recorded within segment operating
income were $56 million for the six months ended July 2, 2015 and $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 1, Summary of Signiﬁcant
Accounting Policies — Principles of Consolidation, for additional information.
Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group:
On October 1, 2012, we divested the Kraft Foods Group grocery business in a spin-off (“Spin-Off”). In 2014, we concluded our
Spin-Off—related transition plans and recorded final Spin-Off transaction, transition and ﬁnancing and related costs (“Spin-Off Costs”) of $35 million in
2014 in pre-tax earnings within selling, general and administrative expenses.
Other Divestitures and Acquisitions:
On January 18, 2017, we reached an agreement to sell most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Bega Cheese Limited for
approximately $460 million Australian dollars ($346 million as of January 18, 2017). As of December 31, 2016, the asset group to be sold consisted
of approximately $25 million of current assets and approximately $125 million of non-current assets based on the December 31, 2016
Australian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. We expect the transaction to close in 2017.
