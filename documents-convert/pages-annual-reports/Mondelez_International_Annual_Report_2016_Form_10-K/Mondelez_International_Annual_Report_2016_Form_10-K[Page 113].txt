As of January 1, 2016, our unrecognized tax beneﬁts were $756 million. If we had recognized all of these benefits, the net impact on our income tax
provision would have been $652 million. Our unrecognized tax beneﬁts were $610 million at December 31, 2016, and if we had recognized all of
these beneﬁts, the net impact on our income tax provision would have been $549 million. Within the next 12 months, our unrecognized tax beneﬁts
could increase by approximately $40 million due to unfavorable audit developments or decrease by approximately $160 million due to audit
settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions. We include accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax
positions in our tax provision. We had accrued interest and penalties of $185 million as of January 1, 2016 and $189 million as of December 31,
2016. Our 2016 provision for income taxes included $15 million for interest and penalties.
Our income tax filings are regularly examined by federal, state and non-U.S. tax authorities. Examination by the IRS of our 2013-2015 US. federal
income tax ﬁlings will begin in the ﬁrst quarter of 2017. US. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three
to ﬁve years; however, these statutes are often extended by mutual agreement with the tax authorities. Years still open to examination by non-U.S.
tax authorities in majorjurisdictions include (earliest open tax year in parentheses): Brazil (2011), China (2007), France (2010), Germany (2010),
India (2005), Italy (2011) and the United Kingdom (2013).
