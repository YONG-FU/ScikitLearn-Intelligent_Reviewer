Adjusted Operating Income:
Applying the deﬁnition of “Adjusted Operating Income”, the adjustments made to “operating income” (the most comparable US. GAAP ﬁnancial
measure) were to exclude Spin-Off costs, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs, Venezuela historical
operating results and remeasurement and deconsolidation losses, the JDE coffee business transactions gain and net incremental costs, operating
income from our historical coffee business, equity method investment earnings reclassiﬁed to after-tax earnings in OS 2015 in connection with the
coffee business transactions, operating results of the AGF divestiture, pre-tax gains on the AGF and Costa Rica confectionery business divestitures,
divestiture-related costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in France, gain on sale of an intangible asset, impairment charges
related to intangible assets, the Integration Program and other acquisition integration costs, acquisition-related costs and mark-to-market impacts
from commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts. We also present “Adjusted Operating Income margin,” which is subject to
the same adjustments as Adjusted Operating Income, and evaluate Adjusted Operating Income on a constant currency basis. We believe these
measures provide improved comparability of underlying operating results.
