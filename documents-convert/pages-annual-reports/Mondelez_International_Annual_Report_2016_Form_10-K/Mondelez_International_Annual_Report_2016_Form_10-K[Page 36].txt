Net revenue decline of 13.5% was driven by unfavorable currency and the impact of the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, partially
offset by the historical results of our Venezuelan operations, our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 1.4%, the impact of acquisitions and the
impact of an accounting calendar change. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $3,565 million, due primarily to the strength of
the US. dollar relative to several currencies, including the euro, Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Australian dollar and British pound sterling. The
adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,149 million for 2015. The
historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation contributed a year-over year increase in net
revenues of $457 million for 2015. Organic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume / mix. Net
pricing was up as we realized the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during the year. Higher net pricing was reﬂected across all
segments. Unfavorable volume / mix was largely due to price elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines.
Unfavorable volume / mix was reﬂected in all segments except North America. The July 2015 acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam added
$128 million in incremental net revenues (constant currency basis) for the year. The February 2015 acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food
business in North America added $37 million in incremental net revenues for the year. The North America segment accounting calendar change
resulted in a year-over-year increase in net revenues of $78 million for the year.
