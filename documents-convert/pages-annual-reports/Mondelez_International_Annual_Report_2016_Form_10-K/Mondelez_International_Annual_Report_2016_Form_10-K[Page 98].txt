Components of Net Periodic Pension Cost:
Net periodic pension cost consisted of the following:

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of prior service cost includes $17 million of pension curtailment losses related to employees who transitioned to
JDE upon the contribution of our global coffee business. Refer to Note 2 , Divestitures and Acquisitions — JDE Coffee Business Transactions , for more information.
(2) Settlement losses include $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 of pension settlement losses for
employees who elected lump-sum payments in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Retired employees who elected lump-sum payments resulted
in net settlement losses in 2016 of $15 million for our U.S. plans and $6 million for our non-U.S. plans and in 2015 of $10 million for our U.S. plans and $2 million for
our non-U.S. plans. Employees who elected lump-sum payments in connection with our 2012-2014 Restructuring Program and cost saving initiatives and retired
employees who elected lump-sum payments resulted in net settlement losses for our U.S. plans of $28 million in 2014. In addition, we incurred special termination
beneﬁt costs of $2 million in 2014 in the non-U.S. plans related to the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program. See Note 6, Restructuring Programs , for more information.
We recorded an additional $90 million of pension settlement losses related to the coffee business transactions within the gain on the coffee business transactions.
Refer to Note 2 , Divestitures and Acquisitions — JDE Coffee Business Transactions , for more information.
For the U.S. plans, we determine the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost using a calculated market return value
that recognizes the cost over a four year period. For our non-U.S. plans, we utilize a similar approach with varying cost recognition periods for some
plans, and with others, we determine the expected return on plan assets based on asset fair values as of the measurement date.
As of December 31, 2016, for the combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, we expected to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive
earnings / (losses) into net periodic pension cost during 2017:
0 an estimated $202 million of net loss from experience differences; and
0 $1 million of estimated prior service credit.
We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net periodic pension cost:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
