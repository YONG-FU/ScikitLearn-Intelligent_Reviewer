2016 compared with 2015:
Net revenues decreased $1,596 million (32.0%), due to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations (21.9 pp), unfavorable currency (14.8 pp),
unfavorable volume / mix (5.3 pp) and the impact of a divestiture (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (10.1 pp). The deconsolidation of our
Venezuelan operations resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1 ,217 million. Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to
the strength of the US. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Argentinean peso and Mexican peso. Unfavorable volume / mix,
which primarily occurred in Brazil and Argentina, was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain
low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven by declines in all categories except for cheese & grocery. Higher net pricing was
reflected across all categories driven primarily by Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.
Segment operating income decreased $214 million (44.1%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan
operations, unfavorable volume / mix and unfavorable currency. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower other
selling, general and administrative expenses (including higher year-over year VAT-related settlements), lower manufacturing costs, lower advertising
and consumer promotion costs, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and the absence of remeasurement losses in 2016
related to our net monetary assets in Venezuela.
2015 compared with 2014:
Net revenues decreased $165 million (3.2%), due to unfavorable currency (21.0 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (5.1 pp) and the adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.1 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (12.0 pp) and the favorable historical results of our
Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation (11.0 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength
of the US. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Argentinean peso. Unfavorable volume /
mix was largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable
volume / mix was driven by declines in chocolate, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits, gum & candy.
The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $5 million. Higher net
pricing was reﬂected across all categories. Both the unfavorable volume / mix and higher net pricing were driven primarily by Brazil and Argentina.
Segment operating income increased $10 million (2.1%), primarily due to higher net pricing, higher remeasurement losses in 2014 related to our net
monetary assets in Venezuela, the favorable historical results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries prior to the December 31, 2015 deconsolidation, lower
manufacturing costs and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher raw material
costs, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, higher other selling, general and administrative expenses (including
lower year-over-year VAT-related settlements), unfavorable volume / mix, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and an
intangible asset impairment charge in 2015 related to a biscuit trademark.
