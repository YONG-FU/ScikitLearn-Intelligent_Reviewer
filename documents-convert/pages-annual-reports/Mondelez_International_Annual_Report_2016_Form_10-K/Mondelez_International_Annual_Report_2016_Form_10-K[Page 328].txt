ARTICLE VII
The Administrative Agent
SECTION 7.01 Authorization and Action . Each Lender hereby appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or
to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall
be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of Notes; provided, however,, that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that exposes the
Administrative Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt
notice of each notice given to it by Mondeléz or the Borrower as required by the terms of this Agreement or at the request of Mondeléz or the Borrower, and any
notice provided pursuant to Section 5.01(c)(iv). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein, no Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any ﬁduciary relationship with any Lender or participant,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against any Agent.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term “agent” herein with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or
other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
intended to create or reﬂect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.
SECTION 7.02 AdministratiyeiAgenth,Reliance.,Etc,.,Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall
be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:
(a) may treat the Lender that made any Loan as the holder of the Debt resulting therefrom until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance entered into by such Lender, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07;
(b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for Mondeléz or the Borrower), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it
and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts,
