Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be exchanged only in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if
temporary Securities of any particular series are issued, the Company will cause deﬁnitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After
the preparation of such deﬁnitive Securities, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for such definitive Securities and of a like Stated
Maturity and with like terms and provisions upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series, at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment
for that series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any particular series, the Company shall
execute and (in accordance with a Company Order delivered at or prior to the authentication of the ﬁrst definitive Security of such series) the Trustee for the
Securities of such series or the Global Exchange Agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of
authorized denominations of the same series and of a like Stated Maturity and with like terms and provisions. Until exchanged as hereinabove provided, the
temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same beneﬁts under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and with like
terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Any temporary Global Security and any permanent Global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered to a Depositary designated pursuant
to Section 301.
Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date speciﬁed in or determined pursuant to the terms of any such temporary Global Security
(the “Exchange Date”), the Securities represented by any temporary Global Security may be exchanged for deﬁnitive Securities (subject to the second succeeding
paragraph) or Securities to be represented thereafter by one or more permanent Global Securities. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary Global Security
shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee for such Security, as the Company’s agent for such purpose, or the agent appointed by the Company pursuant
to Section 301 to effect the exchange of the temporary Global Security for deﬁnitive Securities (the “Global Exchange Agent”), and following such surrender, such
Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent (as appointed by the Trustee as an Authenticating Agent pursuant to Section 614) shall (1) endorse the temporary Global
Security to reﬂect the reduction of its principal amount by an equal aggregate principal amount of such Security, (2) endorse the applicable permanent Global
Security, if any, to reﬂect the initial amount, or an increase in the amount of Securities represented thereby, (3) manually authenticate such definitive Securities or
such permanent Global Security, as the case may be, (4) subject to Section 303, deliver such definitive Securities to the Holder thereof or, as the case may be,
deliver such permanent Global Security to the Depositary to be held outside the United States for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream, for credit to the
respective accounts at Euroclear and Clearstream, designated by or on behalf of the beneﬁcial owners of such Securities (or to such other accounts as they may
direct) and (5) redeliver such temporary Global Security to the Depositary, unless such temporary Global Security shall have been canceled in accordance with
Section 309 hereof; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security, upon such presentation by the Depositary, such
temporary Global Security shall be accompanied by a certiﬁcate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear as to the portion of such
temporary Global Security held for its account then to be exchanged for deﬁnitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, and a
certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Clearstream, as to the portion of such temporary Global Security held for its account then to
be exchanged for deﬁnitive Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities, as the case may be, each substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B to this
Indenture. Each certiﬁcate substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, shall be based on certiﬁcates of the account
holders listed in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, as being entitled to all or any portion of the applicable temporary Global Security. An
account holder of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, desiring to effect the exchange of interest in a temporary Global Security for an interest in deﬁnitive
Securities or one or more permanent Global Securities shall instruct Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, to request such exchange on its behalf and shall
deliver to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certiﬁcate substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
Exchange Date. Until so exchanged, temporary Global Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the same beneﬁts under this Indenture as definitive Securities
and permanent Global Securities of the same series authenticated and delivered hereunder, except as provided in the fourth succeeding paragraph.
The delivery to the Trustee for the Securities of the appr0priate series or the Global Exchange Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream of any certiﬁcate
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto may be relied upon by the Company and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent as conclusive evidence that a
corresponding certiﬁcate or certificates has or have been delivered to Euroclear or to Clearstream, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.
On or prior to the Exchange Date, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee for the Securities of the appropriate series or the Global Exchange Agent deﬁnitive
Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of such temporary Global Security, executed by the Company. At any time, on or after the
Exchange Date, upon 30 days’ notice to the Trustee for the Securities of the appr0priate series or the Global Exchange Agent by Euroclear or Clearstream, as the
case may be, acting at the request of or on behalf of the beneficial owner, a Security represented by a temporary Global Security or a permanent Global Security, as
the case may be, may be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities without charge and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent
shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary Global Security or such permanent Global Security, an equal aggregate principal
amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations and with like terms and provisions as the portion of such temporary Global Security
or such permanent Global Security to be exchanged, which, shall be in the form of Registered Securities. On or prior to the thirtieth day following receipt by the
Trustee for the Securities of the appr0priate series or the Global Exchange Agent of such notice with respect to a Security, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the
next succeeding Business Day, the temporary Global Security or the permanent Global Security, as the case may be, shall be surrendered by the Depositary to such
Trustee, as the Company’s agent for such purpose, or the Global Exchange Agent to be exchanged in whole, or from time to time in part, for definitive Securities
without charge following such surrender, upon the request of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, and such Trustee or the Global Exchange Agent shall
(1) endorse the applicable temporary Global Security or the permanent Global Security to reﬂect the reduction of its principal amount by the aggregate principal
amount of such Security, (2) in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Trustee cause the terms of such Security to be entered on a definitive Security, and
(3) manually authenticate such deﬁnitive Security.
