Comparison of Five-Year Cumulative Total Return
The following graph compares the cumulative total return on our Common Stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the
Mondelez International performance peer group index. The graph assumes, in each case, that an initial investment of $100 is made at the beginning
of the ﬁve-year period. The cumulative total return reﬂects market prices at the end of each year and the reinvestment of dividends each year (and
takes into account the value of Kraft Foods Group shares distributed in the spin-off of our grocery business). The vertical line below indicates the
October 1, 2012 Spin-Off date and is intended to facilitate comparisons of performance against peers listed below and the stock market before and
following the Spin-Off.
