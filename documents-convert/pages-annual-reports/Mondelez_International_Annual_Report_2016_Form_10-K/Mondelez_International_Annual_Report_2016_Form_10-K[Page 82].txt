During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the acquisition of a Vietnamese biscuit operation within our AMEA segment. On July 15, 2015, we
acquired an 80% interest in the biscuit operation and on August 22, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest. Total cash paid for the biscuit
operation, intellectual property, non-compete and consulting agreements less purchase price adjustments was 12,404 billion Vietnamese dong
($569 million using applicable exchange rates on July 15, 2015, November 27, 2015 and August 22, 2016). On August 22, 2016, in connection with
acquiring the remaining 20% interest in the biscuit operation, we released escrowed funds of $70 million and retained an agreed $20 million related
to two outstanding acquisition-related matters that are expected to be resolved in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, we released an additional
$5 million of the escrowed funds and are holding $15 million until the outstanding acquisition matters are resolved. On August 22, 2016, we also
made a ﬁnal payment of 759 billion Vietnamese dong ($35 million as of August 22, 2016) for the non-compete and consulting agreements. The
non-compete and consulting agreements were recorded as prepaid contracts within other current and non-current assets and will be amortized into
net earnings over the term of the agreements. During the third quarter of 2016, we also ﬁnalized the valuation and purchase price allocation of the
acquired net assets of the business, which included $10 million of inventory, $49 million of property, plant and equipment, $86 million of intangible
assets, $385 million of goodwill and $31 million of other net liabilities. In periods following the initial July 15, 2015 first closing date, the allocation of
the net asset fair values had an immaterial impact on our operating results. The acquisition added incremental net revenues of $71 million in 2016
and $121 million in 2015 and added incremental operating income of $5 million in 2016 and $21 million in 2015. Within selling, general and
administrative expenses, we recorded integration costs of $7 million in 2016 and $9 million in 2015 and acquisition costs of $7 million in 2015 and
$2 million in 2014.
On April 23, 2015, we completed the divestiture of our 50% equity interest in AGF, our Japanese coffee joint venture, to ourjoint venture partner,
which generated cash proceeds of 27 billion Japanese yen ($225 million as of April 23, 2015) and a pre-tax gain of $13 million (after-tax loss of $9
million) in the second quarter of 2015. Upon closing, we divested our $99 million investment in the joint venture, $65 million of goodwill and
$41 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses. We also incurred approximately $7 million of transaction costs in 2015.
On February 16, 2015, we acquired a U.S. snack food company, Enjoy Life Foods, within our North America segment. We paid cash and settled debt
totaling $81 million in connection with the acquisition. Upon ﬁnalizing the valuation of the acquired net assets during the second quarter of 2015, we
recorded an $81 million purchase price allocation of $58 million in identiﬁable intangible assets, $20 million of goodwill and $3 million of other net
assets. The acquisition-related costs and operating results of the acquisition were not material to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Sales of Property:
On November 9, 2016, we completed the sale of a manufacturing plant in Russia and recorded total expenses of $12 million, including a related ﬁxed
asset impairment charge of $4 million within asset impairments and exit costs. The sale of the land, buildings and equipment generated cash
proceeds of $6 million.
In 2016, we also sold property within our North America segment and from our centrally held corporate assets. In the third quarter, we sold property
in North America that generated cash proceeds of $10 million and a pre-tax gain of $6 million and we sold a corporate aircraft hangar that generated
cash proceeds of $3 million and a pre-tax gain of $1 million. In the second quarter, we also sold separate property in North America that generated
cash proceeds of $40 million and a pre-tax gain of $33 million and we sold a corporate aircraft that generated cash proceeds of $20 million and a
pre-tax gain of $6 million. The gains were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and cash proceeds were recorded in cash
ﬂows from other investing activities in year ended December 31, 2016.
