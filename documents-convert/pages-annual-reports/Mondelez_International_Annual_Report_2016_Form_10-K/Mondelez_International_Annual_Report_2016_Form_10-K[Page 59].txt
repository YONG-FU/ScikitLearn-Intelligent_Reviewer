Adjusted EPS:
Applying the deﬁnition of “Adjusted EPS” (1) , the adjustments made to “diluted EPS attributable to Mondelez International” (the most comparable
U.S. GAAP ﬁnancial measure) were to exclude Spin-Off Costs, 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, 2014-2018 Restructuring Program costs;
Venezuela historical operating results and deconsolidation and remeasurement losses; the JDE coffee business transactions gain, hedging gains
and incremental costs; net earnings from the AGF divestiture; after-tax gain on the Costa Rica confectionery business divestiture and after-tax loss
on the AGF divestiture; divestiture-related costs incurred for the planned sale of a confectionery business in France; gain on sale of intangible asset;
impairment charges related to intangible assets; acquisition integration costs; acquisition-related costs; mark-to-market impacts from commodity and
forecasted currency transaction derivative contracts; a loss on debt extinguishment and related expenses; losses on interest rate swaps no longer
designated as accounting cash flow hedges due to changed ﬁnancing and hedging plans; gain on the equity method investment exchange; and our
proportionate share of unusual or infrequent items recorded by our JDE and Keurig equity method investees. We also evaluate Adjusted EPS on a
constant currency basis. We believe Adjusted EPS provides improved comparability of underlying operating results.
