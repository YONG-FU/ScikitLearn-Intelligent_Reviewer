In 2015, we also began to report stock-based compensation for our corporate employees within general corporate expenses that were reported

segment to general corporate expenses.
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to

Affecting Comparability of Financial Results earlier in this section for items affecting our segment operating results.
