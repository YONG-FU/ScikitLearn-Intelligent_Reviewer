each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or
any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Advances or its other Obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such

by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Mondeléz to require such termination or assignment cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that, if Mondeléz
elects to replace such Lender in accordance with this Section 9.07, it shall promptly execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance
to evidence the assignment and shall deliver to the Administrative Agent any Note (if Notes have been issued in respect of such Lender’s Advances) subject to such
Assignment and Acceptance; providedthat the failure of any such Lender to execute an Assignment and Acceptance shall not render such assignment invalid and
such assignment shall be recorded in the Register.
