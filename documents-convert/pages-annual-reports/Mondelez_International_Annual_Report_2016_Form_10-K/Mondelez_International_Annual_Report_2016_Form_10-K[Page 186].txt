SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise provided pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Sections 311(b) and 311(d)) and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of the Redemption Price) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice,
such Security or speciﬁed portions thereof shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price; provided, however, that unless otherwise speciﬁed as
contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the
Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant record dates according to their terms
and the provisions of Section 307.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal thereof and premium, if any, thereon shall,
until paid, bear interest from the Redemption Date at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Security (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Security’s
Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the specified terms of those Securities).
SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at the Place of Payment (with, if the Company or the Trustee for such
Security so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such Security duly
executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute and such Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, of the same
series and having the same terms and provisions and in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the
Registered Security so surrendered. In the case of a Global Note, the aggregate principal amount of such Global Note shall be reduced in accordance with the
applicable procedures of the Trustee and the Depositary.
SECTION 1108. Tax Redemption; Special Tax Redemption.
(a) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, Securities of any series may be redeemed at the option of the Company in whole, but not in part, on
not more than 60 days’ and not less than 30 days’ notice, on any Redemption Date at the Redemption Price speciﬁed pursuant to Section 301, if the Company
determines that (A) as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of the United States or of any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein affecting taxation, or any change in official position regarding application or interpretation of such laws,
regulations or rulings (including a holding by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States), which change or amendment is announced or becomes
effective on or after a date specified in Section 301 with respect to any Security of such series, the Company has or will become obligated to pay additional amounts
pursuant to Section 1010 with respect to any Security of such series or (B) on or after a date speciﬁed in Section 301 with respect to any Security of such series, any
action has been taken by any taxing authority of, or any decision has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in, the United States or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, including any of those actions specified in (A) above, whether or not such action was taken or decision was
rendered with respect to the Company, or any change, amendment, application or interpretation shall be officially proposed, which, in any such case, in the Opinion
of Counsel to the Company will result in a material probability that the Company will become obligated to pay additional amounts with respect to any Security of
such series, and (C) in any such case specified in (A) or (B) above the Company, in its business judgment, determines that such obligation cannot be avoided by the
use of reasonable measures available to the Company. Any such redemption shall comply with the provisions of Section 1104 hereof
(b) Reserved.
