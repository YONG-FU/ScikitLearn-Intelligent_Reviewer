In 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were no impairments of goodwill. In connection with our 2016 annual impairment testing, each of our reporting units
had sufﬁcient fair value in excess of carrying value. While all reporting units passed our annual impairment testing, if planned business performance
expectations are not met or speciﬁc valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change signiﬁcantly, then the estimated fair
values of a reporting unit or reporting units might decline and lead to a goodwill impairment in the future.
During our 2016 annual testing of non-amortizable intangible assets, we recorded $98 million of impairment charges related to ﬁve trademarks. The
impairments arose due to lower than expected product growth in part driven by decisions to redirect support from these trademarks to other regional
and global brands, as well as slowdowns in local economies. We recorded charges related to biscuits, candy and gum trademarks of $41 million in
AMEA, $32 million in North America, $22 million in Europe, and $3 million in Latin America. The impairment charges were calculated as the excess
of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the intangible assets on a global basis and were recorded within asset impairment and exit
costs. We primarily use a relief of royalty valuation method, which utilizes estimates of future sales, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates in
determining a brand’s global fair value. During our 2016 intangible asset impairment review, we noted nine brands, including the ﬁve impaired
trademarks, with $630 million of aggregate book value as of December 31, 2016 that each had a fair value in excess of book value of 10% or less.
While the other four intangible assets passed our annual impairment testing and we believe our current plans for each of these brands will allow them
to continue to not be impaired, if the product line expectations are not met or speciﬁc valuation factors outside of our control, such as discount rates,
change signiﬁcantly, then a brand or brands could become impaired in the future. In 2015, we recorded a $44 million charge related to candy and
biscuit trademarks in our AMEA segment, $22 million in Europe and $5 million in Latin America. In 2014, we recorded a $48 million charge related to
a biscuit trademark in our AMEA segment and a $9 million charge related to a candy trademark in our Europe segment.
Note 6. Restructuring Programs
On May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a $3.5 billion restructuring program, comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and
$1 billion in non-cash costs (the “2014-2018 Restructuring Program”) and up to $2.2 billion of capital expenditures. On August 31, 2016, our Board of
Directors approved a reallocation within the $5.7 billion total cost of the programs of $600 million of previously approved capital expenditures to be
spent on restructuring program cash costs. There was no change to the total $5.7 billion cost of the programs and no change to the total $4.7 billion
of cash outlays. The $5.7 billion total cost of the programs is now comprised of approximately $4.1 billion of restructuring program costs ($3.1 billion
cash costs and $1 billion non-cash costs) and up to $1.6 billion of capital expenditures. The primary objective of the 2014-2018 Restructuring
Program is to reduce our operating cost structure in both our supply chain and overhead costs. The program is intended primarily to cover severance
as well as asset disposals and other manufacturing-related one-time costs. Since inception, we have incurred total restructuring and related
implementation charges of $2.5 billion related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We have incurred the majority of the program’s charges
through 2016 and we expect to complete the program by year-end 2018.
Restructuring Costs:
We recorded restructuring charges of $714 million in 2016, $711 million 2015 and $274 million in 2014 within asset impairment and exit costs. The
2014-2018 Restructuring Program liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was:
