Deferred debt issuance costs of $40 million as of December 31, 2016 and $46 million as of December 31, 2015 are netted against the related debt in
the table above. These amounts were reclassiﬁed from long-term other assets to offset the related debt in the fourth quarter of 2015, except for
deferred financing costs related to our revolving credit facility which remain in long-term other assets and were immaterial for all periods presented.
As of December 31, 2016, aggregate maturities of our debt and capital leases based on stated contractual maturities, excluding unamortized

On December 16, 2016, we redeemed $850 million of 2.250% ﬁxed rate notes, maturing on February 1, 2019, that were issued on January 16, 2014.
The notes were redeemed at a redemption cost equal to $866 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $7 million. In connection with this
redemption, during the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $19 million loss on debt extinguishment within interest and other
expense,neL
On October 31, 2016, we completed a cash tender offer and retired $3.18 billion of U.S. dollar, euro and British pound sterling-denominated notes.
We ﬁnanced the repurchase of the notes, including the payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received on
October 28, 2016 from the $3.75 billion note issuance and the term loans described below. In connection with retiring this debt, during the three
months ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $409 million loss on debt extinguishment within interest expense related to the amount we paid to
retire the debt in excess of its carrying value and from recognizing unamortized premiums and deferred ﬁnancing costs in earnings at the time of the
debt extinguishment. Cash costs related to tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows
for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also recognized $1 million in interest income related to the partial settlement of fair value hedges due to
the tender.
On October 19, 2016, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mondelez International, Inc.,
launched an offering of $3.75 billion of notes, guaranteed by Mondelez International, Inc. The $1.75 billion of 1.625% notes and the $500 million of
ﬂoating rate notes will mature on October 28, 2019 and the $1.5 billion of 2.0% notes will mature on October 28, 2021. On October 28, 2016, we
received proceeds, net of discounts and associated ﬁnancing costs, of $3.73 billion. Proceeds from the notes issuance were used for general
corporate purposes, including to grant loans or make distributions to Mondelez International, Inc. or its subsidiaries to fund the October 2016 cash
tender offer and near-term debt maturities. We recorded approximately $20 million of deferred ﬁnancing costs and discounts, which will be amortized
into interest expense over the life of the notes. We entered into cross-currency swaps, serving as cash ﬂow hedges, so that the U.S. dollar-
denominated debt payments will effectively be paid in euros over the life of the debt.
