Deferred Stock Units, Performance Share Units and Restricted Stock:
Historically we have made grants of deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock. Beginning in 2016, we only grant deferred
stock units and performance share units and no longer grant restricted stock. We may grant shares of deferred stock units to eligible employees,
giving them, in most instances, all of the rights of shareholders, except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or othen/vise encumber the shares and
our deferred stock units do not have voting rights until vested. Shares of deferred stock units are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions
are not met. Deferred stock units generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance share units granted under our 2005 Plan vest
based on varying performance, market and service conditions. The unvested performance share units have no voting rights and do not pay
dividends. Dividend equivalents accumulated over the vesting period are paid only after the performance share units vest.
The fair value of the deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock at the date of grant is amortized to earnings over the
restriction period. We recorded compensation expense related to deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock of $83 million in
2016, $86 million in 2015 and $94 million in 2014 in our results from continuing operations. The deferred tax beneﬁt recorded related to this
compensation expense was $22 million in 2016, $24 million in 2015 and $26 million in 2014. The unamortized compensation expense related to our
deferred stock units, performance share units and restricted stock was $111 million at December 31, 2016 and is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 2 years.
