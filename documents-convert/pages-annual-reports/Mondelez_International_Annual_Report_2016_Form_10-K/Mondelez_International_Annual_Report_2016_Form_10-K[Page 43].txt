2016 compared with 2015:
Net revenues decreased $186 million (3.1%), due to unfavorable currency (3.7 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business
(1.1 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (1.0 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (1.5 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (1.2 pp). Unfavorable
currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the US. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Chinese yuan, Indian
rupee, South African rand, Egyptian pound, Nigerian naira, Australian dollar and Philippine peso, partially offset by the strength of the Japanese yen
relative to the US. dollar. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of
$66 million. Unfavorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by
declines in candy, cheese & grocery, refreshment beverages and chocolate, partially offset by gains in biscuits and gum. Higher net pricing was
driven by chocolate, candy, biscuits and refreshment beverages, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and gum. The acquisition of
a biscuit operation in Vietnam in July 2015 added net revenues of $71 million (constant currency basis).
Segment operating income increased $117 million (30.1%), primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, higher net pricing, lower other selling,
general and administrative expenses, lower costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, the absence of costs associated with the coffee
business transactions, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower advertising and consumer promotion costs. These favorable items were
partially offset by higher raw material costs, the reclassiﬁcation of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume / mix, unfavorable
currency, the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, and the impact of divestitures.
2015 compared with 2014:
Net revenues decreased $365 million (5.7%), due to unfavorable currency (8.8 pp), unfavorable volume / mix (2.5 pp) and the adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business (0.6 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (4.2 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (2.0 pp).
Unfavorable currency impacts were due primarily to the strength of the US. dollar relative to most currencies in the region, including the Australian
dollar, South African rand, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Nigerian naira, Chinese yuan and Egyptian pound. Unfavorable volume / mix was due largely
to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix was driven
by declines in all categories except biscuits and gum. The adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year
decrease in net revenues of $49 million. Higher net pricing was reﬂected across all categories. The acquisition of a biscuit operation in Vietnam in
July 2015 added net revenues of $128 million (constant currency basis).
Segment operating income decreased $141 million (26.6%), primarily due to higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018
Restructuring Program, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable currency, higher other selling, general and administrative
expenses (including a phase-out of a local tax incentive program), the reclassification of equity method investment earnings, unfavorable volume /
mix, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, costs associated with the coffee business transactions and higher other
acquisition-related integration costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, lower manufacturing costs, the absence of
2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, the impact of the Vietnam acquisition and lower intangible asset impairment charges (related to candy and
biscuit trademarks in 2015 and a biscuit trademark in 2014).
