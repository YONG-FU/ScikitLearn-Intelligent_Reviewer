If at any time the Depositary for Securities of a series in registered form notiﬁes the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for the
Securities of such series or if at any time the Depositary for the Securities of such series shall no longer be eligible under Section 303, the Company shall appoint a
successor Depositary with respect to the Securities for such series. If (i) a successor Depositary for the Securities of such series is not appointed by the Company
within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (ii) the Company delivers to the Trustee for Securities of such series
in registered form a Company Order stating that the Securities of such series shall be exchangeable, or (iii) an Event of Default under Section 501 hereof has
occurred and is continuing with respect to the Securities of such series, the Company’s election pursuant to Section 301 shall no longer be effective with respect to
the Securities for such series and the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a Company Order for the authentication and delivery of deﬁnitive
Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver Securities of such series in deﬁnitive form in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of
the Global Security or Securities representing such series in exchange for such Global Security or Securities.
The Company may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Global
Securities shall no longer be represented by such Global Security or Securities. In such event the Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of a
Company Order for the authentication and delivery of definitive Registered Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Registered Securities of such
series in definitive form and in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security or Securities representing such series in
exchange for such Global Security or Securities. If specified by the Company pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of Securities in registered form, the
Depositary for such series of Securities may surrender a Global Security for such series of Securities in exchange in whole or in part for Securities of such series of
like tenor and terms and in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Company and such Depositary. Thereupon the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge, (i) to each Person specified by such Depositary a new Security or Securities of the same series, of like
tenor and terms and of any authorized denomination as requested by such Person in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person’s
beneﬁcial interest in the Global Security and (ii) to such Depositary a new Global Security of like tenor and terms and in a denomination equal to the difference, if
any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Global Security and the aggregate principal amount of Securities delivered to Holders thereof
Upon the exchange of a Global Security for Securities in deﬁnitive form, such Global Security shall be canceled by the Trustee. Registered Securities issued
in exchange for a Global Security pursuant to this Section shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Global
Security, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee in writing. The Trustee shall deliver such Registered
Security to the persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same beneﬁts under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee for such Security) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar for such series duly executed, by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant
to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1104 and ending at the
close of business on the day of the mailing of the relevant notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Registered Security so selected for
redemption as a whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 305, the Company will not be required to exchange any Securities if, as a result of the
exchange, the Company would suffer adverse consequences under any United States law or regulation.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture
or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants or beneficial
owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certiﬁcates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and
to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express
requirements hereof.
