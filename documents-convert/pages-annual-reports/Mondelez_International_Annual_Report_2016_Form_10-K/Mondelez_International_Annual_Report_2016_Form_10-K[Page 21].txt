Item 2. Properties.
On December 31, 2016, we had 150 manufacturing and processing facilities in 52 countries and 130 distribution centers and depots worldwide.
During 2016, we added 5 new manufacturing facilities and disposed of or ceased operations in 9 manufacturing facilities. We also added 4 new
distribution facilities and no longer own or lease 12 distribution facilities. In addition, a decrease of 49 distribution facilities in predominantly EU and
AMEA primarily reflects distribution facilities that are owned or leased by third party logistics partners. In addition to our owned or leased properties
listed below, we also utilize a highly distributed network of warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by third party logistics
partners, contract manufacturers, co-packers or other strategic partners. We believe we have or will add sufﬁcient capacity to meet our planned
operating needs. It is our practice to maintain all of our plants and other facilities in good condition.
