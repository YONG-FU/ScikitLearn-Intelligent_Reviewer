SECTION 104. Acts of Holders.
(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders
may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by one or more agents duly
appointed in writing.
The Company may at its discretion set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Registered Securities entitled to vote or consent to
any action by vote or consent authorized or permitted under this Indenture, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If not set by the Company prior to
the first solicitation of Holders of Registered Securities of a particular series made by any Person in respect of any such action or, in the case of any such vote, prior
to such vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be 30 days prior to the ﬁrst solicitation of such vote or consent. Upon the ﬁxing of such a record date
those Persons who were Holders of Registered Securities at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled with respect
to such Registered Securities to take such action by vote or consent or to revoke any vote or consent previously given, whether or not such Persons continue to be
Holders after such record date.
(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved by the afﬁdavit of a witness of such execution or
by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or
writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by an ofﬁcer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, or an
official of a public or governmental body, on behalf of such corporation, association, partnership or public or governmental body or by a ﬁduciary, such certificate
or affidavit shall also constitute sufﬁcient proof of his authority.
(c) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be
proved in any other manner which the Trustee for the apprOpriate series of Securities deems sufﬁcient.
(d) The principal amount and serial numbers of Registered Securities held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the
Security Register.
(e) Reserved.
(f) Subject to Section 115, in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities have given any request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under this Indenture, the principal amount of an OID Security that may be counted in making such
determination and that shall be deemed to be Outstanding for such purposes shall be equal to the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable
upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502 at the time the taking of such action by the Holders of such requisite principal
amount is evidenced to the Trustee for such Securities.
(g) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder
of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything
done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee for such Securities, the Security Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not
notation of such action is made upon such Security.
