2016 compared with 2015:
Net revenues decreased $14 million (0.2%), due to the impact of an accounting calendar change made in the prior year (1.1 pp), unfavorable
currency (0.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.2 pp), partially offset by favorable volume/mix (1.4 pp). The prior-year change in North America’s
accounting calendar resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $76 million. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of the
US. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar. Lower net pricing was reﬂected in biscuits, partially offset by higher net pricing in chocolate, gum and
candy. Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by gains in
biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate.
Segment operating income decreased $27 million (2.4%), primarily due to higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, higher
advertising and consumer promotion costs, intangible asset impairment charges, the year-over-year impact of the prior-year accounting calendar
change, higher raw material costs and lower net pricing. These unfavorable items were mostly offset by lower other selling, general and
administrative expenses (including the gain on sale of property), lower manufacturing costs, favorable volume/mix and the gain on the sale of an
intangible asset.
2015 compared with 2014:
Net revenues increased $38 million (0.5%), due to an accounting calendar change (1.2 pp), an acquisition (0.5 pp), favorable volume / mix (0.5 pp)
and higher net pricing (0.3 pp), partially offset by unfavorable currency (2.0 pp). The change in North America’s accounting calendar added net
revenues of $78 million (constant currency basis). The acquisition of the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in February 2015 added net revenues
of $37 million. Favorable volume / mix was driven by gains in biscuits and candy, partially offset by declines in gum and chocolate. Higher net pricing
was reflected in gum and chocolate, partially offset by lower net pricing in biscuits and candy. Unfavorable currency impact was due to the strength of
the US. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar.
Segment operating income increased $183 million (19.8%), primarily due to the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, lower
manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (including the reclassification of corporate stock-based compensation),
the impact of an accounting calendar change, higher net pricing and lower raw material costs. These favorable items were partially offset by higher
costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, unfavorable currency, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs, unfavorable
volume / mix and the reclassiﬁcation of equity method investment earnings.
