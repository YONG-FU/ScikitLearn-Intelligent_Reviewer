Pension Plans
Prior to the July 2, 2015 closing of the coffee business transactions, certain active employees who transitioned to JDE participated in our Non-U.S.
pension plans. Following the transactions, benefits began to be provided directly by JDE to participants continuing with JDE. JDE assumed certain
pension plan obligations and received the related plan assets. In 2015, we reduced our net beneﬁt plan liabilities by $131 million and the related
deferred tax assets by $24 million. For participants that elected not to transfer into the JDE plans, we retained the plan obligations and related plan
assets.
Obligations and Funded Status:
