At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the
Trustee for the Securities of any series as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that
series, by written notice to the Company and such Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:
(1) the Company has paid or deposited with such Trustee a sum sufﬁcient to pay in the currency or currency unit in which the Securities of such series
are payable (except as otherwise speciﬁed pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except as provided in Sections 311(b) and 311(d)):
(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series;
(B) the principal of, and premium, if any, on any Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration and interest thereon from the date such principal became due at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the Securities of such
series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities’ Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with
the speciﬁed terms of those Securities), to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable;
(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest upon overdue interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by the
Securities of such series (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities’ Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in
accordance with the specified terms of those Securities); and
(D) all sums paid or advanced by such Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607;
and
(2) all Events of Default with respect to the Securities of such series, other than the nonpayment of the principal of Securities of that series which has
become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
The Company covenants that if:
(1) default is made in the payment of any interest upon any Security of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default
continues for a period of 30 days; or
(2) default is made in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, on any Security of any series at its Maturity;
the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee for the Securities of such series, pay to it, for the beneﬁt of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then
due and payable on such Securities for principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, with interest upon the overdue principal and premium, if any, and, to the
extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate borne by such
Securities (or, in the case of (i) OID Securities, the Securities’ Yield to Maturity or (ii) Indexed Securities, the rate determined in accordance with the speciﬁed
terms of those Securities); and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of such Trustee, its agents and counsel and all other amounts due to such Trustee under Section 607.
If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, such Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding against the Company for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceedings to judgment or ﬁnal decree, and
may enforce the same against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner
provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any particular series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series may proceed to
protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of that series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the speciﬁc enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.
