We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively
and pursue growth opportunities as they arise in our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product
categories and ﬁnancial results in the regions.
We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to
help investors analyze segment performance and trends. For a deﬁnition and reconciliation of segment operating income to consolidated pre-tax
earnings as well as other information on our segments, see Note 16, Segment Reporting.
