On July 5, 2016, we received an expected cash payment of $275 million from JDE to settle the receivable related to tax formation costs that were
part of the initial sales price.
In connection with the contribution of our global coffee businesses to JDE on July 2, 2015, we recorded a ﬁnal pre-tax gain of $6.8 billion (or
$6.6 billion after-tax) in 2015 after ﬁnal adjustments described below. As previously reported, we deconsolidated net assets totaling $2.9 billion and
reduced accumulated other comprehensive losses for the transfer of coffee business-related pension obligations by $90 million. We also recorded
approximately $1.0 billion of pre-tax net gains related to hedging the expected cash proceeds from the transactions as described further below.
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we and JDE concluded negotiations of a sales price adjustment and completed the valuation of our investment in
JDE. Primarily due to the negotiated resolution of the sales price adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a $313 million reduction in the
pre-tax gain on the coffee transaction, reducing the $7.1 billion estimated gain in the third quarter of 2015 to the $6.8 billion ﬁnal gain for 2015. As
part of our sales price negotiations, we retained the right to collect future cash payments if certain estimated pension liabilities are realized over an
agreed amount in the future. As such, we may recognize additional income related to this negotiated term in the future.
The ﬁnal value of our 43.5% investment in JDE on July 2, 2015 was 6 4.1 billion ($4.5 billion as of July 2, 2015). The fair value of the JDE investment
was determined using both income-based and market-based valuation techniques. The discounted cash ﬂow analysis reﬂected growth, discount and
tax rates and other assumptions reflecting the underlying combined businesses and countries in which the combined coffee businesses operate. The
fair value of the JDE investment also included the fair values of the Can‘e Noire and Merrild businesses, which JDE agreed to divest to comply with
the conditioned approval by the European Commission related to the JDE coffee business transactions. As of the end of the ﬁrst quarter of 2016,
these businesses were sold by JDE. As the July 2, 2015 fair values for these businesses were recorded by JDE at their pending sales values, we did
not record any gain or loss on the sales of these businesses in our share of JDE’s earnings.
In 2014 and 2015, in connection with the expected receipt of cash in euros at the time of closing, we entered into a number of consecutive currency
exchange fon/vard contracts to lock in an equivalent expected value in US. dollars as of the date the JDE coffee business transactions were ﬁrst
announced in May 2014. Cumulatively, we realized aggregate net gains and received cash of approximately $1.0 billion on these hedging contracts
that increased the cash we received in connection with the JDE coffee business transactions from $4.2 billion in cash consideration received to
$5.2 billion. In connection with these currency contracts and the transfer of the sale proceeds to our subsidiaries that deconsolidated net assets and
shares, we recognized a net gain of $436 million in 2015 and $628 million in 2014 within interest and other expense, net.
We also incurred incremental expenses related to readying our global coffee businesses for the transactions that totaled $278 million for the year
ended December 31, 2015 and $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of these total expenses, $123 million was recorded within asset
impairment and exit costs in 2015 and the remainder was recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses of primarily our Europe
segment, as well as within general corporate expenses.
JDE Capital Increase:
On December 18, 2015, AHBV and we agreed to provide JDE additional capital to pay down some of its debt with lenders. Our pro rata share of the
capital increase was 6 499 million ($544 million as of December 18, 2015) and was made in return for a pro rata number of additional shares in JDE
such that our ownership in JDE did not change following the capital increase. To fund our share of the capital increase, we contributed € 460 million
($501 million) of JDE receivables and made a 6 39 million ($43 million) cash payment.
JDE Stock-Based Compensation Arrangements:
On June 30, 2016, we entered into agreements with AHBV and its afﬁliates to establish a new stock-based compensation arrangement tied to the
issuance of JDE equity compensation awards to JDE employees. This arrangement replaced a temporary equity compensation program tied to the
issuance of AHBV equity compensation to JDE employees. New Class C, D and E JDE shares were authorized and issued for investments made by
and vested stock-based compensation awards granted to JDE employees. Under these arrangements, dilution of the JDE shares is limited to 2%.
Upon execution of the agreements and the creation of the Class C, D and E JDE shares, as a percentage of the total JDE issued shares, our Class B
shares decreased from 26.5% to 26.4% and AHBV’s Class A shares decreased from 73.5% to 73.22%, while the Class C, D and E shares, held by
AHBV and its afﬁliates until the JDE employee awards vest, comprised 0.38% of JDE’s shares. Additional Class C shares are available to be issued
when planned long-term incentive plan (“JDE LTIP”) awards vest, generally over the next ﬁve years. When the JDE Class C shares are issued in
connection with the vested JDE LTIP awards, the Class A and B relative ownership interests will decrease. Based on estimated achievement and
forfeiture assumptions, we do not expect our JDE ownership interest to decrease below 26.27%. Following vesting of stock awards and new
employee stock investments, as of December 31, 2016, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.4%.
