We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our net periodic postretirement health care cost:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
For the Years Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31,
2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014
Discount rate 4.60% 4.20% 5.10% 4.77% 4.52% 5.17% l
Health care cost trend rate 6.50% 6.50% 7.00% 5.50% 5.18% 5.11%
Future Beneﬁt Payments:
Our estimated future benefit payments for our postretirement health care plans at December 31, 2016 were (in millions):
Year ending; 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 72022-20267
lU.S. Plans $8 $10 $11 $12 $13 $80 I
Non-U.S. Plans 5 5 5 6 6 34
Other Costs:
We made contributions to multiemployer medical plans totaling $19 million in 2016, $20 million in 2015 and $18 million in 2014. These plans provide
medical beneﬁts to active employees and retirees under certain collective bargaining agreements.
Postemployment Benefit Plans
Obligations:
Our postemployment plans are primarily not funded. The changes in and the amount of the accrued beneﬁt obligation at December 31, 2016 and
2015 were:
2016 2015
(in millions)
Accrued beneﬁt obligation at January 1 $ 95 $ 94 l
Service cost 7 7

Beneﬁts paid (9) (7)

Accrued beneﬁt obligation at December 31 71: 95:]
The accrued beneﬁt obligation was determined using a weighted-average discount rate of 6.2% in 2016 and 2015, an assumed weighted-average
ultimate annual turnover rate of 0.3% in 2016 and 2015, assumed compensation cost increases of 4.0% in 2016 and 2015 and assumed benefits as
deﬁned in the respective plans.
Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those speciﬁed in the respective plans are charged to expense
when incurred.
Components of Net Periodic Postemployment Costs:
Net periodic postemployment costs consisted of the following:
For the Years Ended December 31,
2016 2015 2014
(in millions)
Service cost $ 7 $ 7 $ 9 l
Interest cost 6 5 6

Net periodic postemployment costs $ 12: $ 12: $ 15:
As of December 31, 2016, the estimated net gain for the postemployment beneﬁt plans that we expected to amortize from accumulated other
comprehensive earnings / (losses) into net periodic postemployment costs during 2017 was approximately $4 million.
