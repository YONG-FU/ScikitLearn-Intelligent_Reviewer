V\ﬁthin interest and other expense, net, we recorded pre-tax losses of 397 million in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016 and $34 million in the ﬁrst quarter of 2015
related to amounts excluded from effectiveness testing. These amounts relate to interest rate swaps no longer designated as cash ﬂow hedges due
to changes in financing plans. Due to lower overall costs and our decision to hedge a greater portion of our net investments in operations that use
currencies other than the US. dollar as their functional currencies, we changed our plans to issue U.S. dollar-denominated debt and instead issued
euro and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the current year ﬁrst quarter, and euro, British pound sterling and Swiss franc-denominated notes in the
prior-year ﬁrst quarter. Amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were not material for the remainder of 2016 and 2015 and prior year periods.
