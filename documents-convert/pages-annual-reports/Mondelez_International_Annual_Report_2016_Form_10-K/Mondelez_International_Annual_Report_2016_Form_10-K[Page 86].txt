We spent $315 million in 2016 and $243 million in 2015 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized non-cash pension settlement
losses (See Note 9, Beneﬁt Plans ), non-cash asset write-downs (including accelerated depreciation and asset impairments) and other non-cash
adjustments totaling $321 million in 2016 and $273 million in 2015. At December 31, 2016, $379 million of our net restructuring liability was recorded
within other current liabilities and $85 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.
Implementation Costs:
Implementation costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or
disposal activities. We believe the disclosure of implementation costs provides readers of our ﬁnancial statements with more information on the total
costs of our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. Implementation costs primarily relate to reorganizing our operations and facilities in connection with
our supply chain reinvention program and other identiﬁed productivity and cost saving initiatives. The costs include incremental expenses related to
the closure of facilities, costs to terminate certain contracts and the simpliﬁcation of our information systems. Within our continuing results of
operations, we recorded implementation costs of $372 million in 2016, $291 million in 2015 and $107 million in 2014. We recorded these costs within
cost of sales and general corporate expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded restructuring and implementation costs related to the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program within operating
