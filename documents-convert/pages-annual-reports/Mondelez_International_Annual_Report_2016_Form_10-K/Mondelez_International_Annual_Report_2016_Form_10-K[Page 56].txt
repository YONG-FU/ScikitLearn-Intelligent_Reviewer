(3) Each year we reevaluate our Power Brands and conﬁrm the brands in which we will continue to make disproportionate investments. As such, we may make changes in our
planned investments in primarily regional Power Brands following our annual review cycles. For 2016, we made limited changes to our list of regional Power Brands and
as such, we reclassiﬁed 2015 and 2014 Power Brand net revenues on a basis consistent with the current list of Power Brands.
