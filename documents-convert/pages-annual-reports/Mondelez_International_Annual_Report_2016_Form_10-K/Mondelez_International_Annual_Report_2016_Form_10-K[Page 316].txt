(k) All amounts payable by the Borrower and Mondeléz hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Administrative Agent which (in whole or
in part) constitute the consideration for a supply or supplies for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply or
supplies, and accordingly, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender or the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any Note and
such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, the Borrower or Mondeléz shall pay to such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT, and such
Lender or the Administrative Agent shall correctly and timely issue an appropriate VAT invoice that meets all EU requirements to the Borrower or Mondeléz,
unless such VAT is owed by the Borrower or Mondeléz to the relevant taxing authority under a reverse charge mechanism.
SECTION 2.16 Sharing of Payments, Etc . If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right
of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Loans owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.12, 2.15 or 9.04(b) or (c)) in excess of its ratable share of payments on
account of the Loans obtained by all the applicable Lenders, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Loans made by
them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided , however , that if all or any portion of
such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the
purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender’s ratable share (according to the proportion of
(i) the amount of such Lender’s required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or
payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.16 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
SECTION 2.17 Evidence of Debt .

the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to
such Lender from time to time hereunder in respect of Loans. The Borrower shall, upon notice by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the
Administrative Agent) to the effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for such Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or
otherwise) the Loans owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a Note, in the case of any Five-Year Loans, in the form
of Exhibit A-1 hereto and in the case of any Three-Year Loans, in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, in each case payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns) in a
principal amount up to the Commitment or Loan of such Lender.
