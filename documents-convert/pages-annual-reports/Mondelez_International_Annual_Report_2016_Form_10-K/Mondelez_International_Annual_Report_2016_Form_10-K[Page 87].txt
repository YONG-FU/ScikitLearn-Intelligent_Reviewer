2012-2014 Restructuring Program
On October 1, 2012, we completed the Spin-Off of our North American grocery business, Kraft Foods Group, to our shareholders. Prior to this
transaction, in 2012, our Board of Directors approved $1.5 billion of restructuring and related implementation costs (the “2012-2014 Restructuring
Program”) reflecting primarily severance, asset disposals and other manufacturing-related one-time costs. The primary objective of the 2012-2014
Restructuring Program was to ensure that Mondelez International and Kraft Foods Group were each set up to operate efﬁciently and execute on our
respective business strategies upon separation and in the future.
Of the $1.5 billion of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs, we retained approximately $925 million and Kraft Foods Group retained the balance of
the program. Through the end of 2014, we incurred total restructuring and related implementation charges of $899 million and completed incurring
planned charges on the 2012-2014 Restructuring Program.
Restructuring Costs:
We recorded reversals to the restructuring charges of $4 million in 2015 related to accruals no longer required. We recorded restructuring charges of
$360 million in 2014 within asset impairment and exit costs. During 2014, we recorded out-of—period accruals for $73 million of severance ($52 million
related to 2014 and $21 million related to 2013) in connection with a change in the timing of accruals for ongoing negotiations with workers’ councils
and labor unions.
The 2012-2014 Restructuring Program liability activity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was:

We spent $21 million in 2016 and $66 million in 2015 in cash severance and related costs. We also recognized non-cash pension plan settlement
losses (See Note 9, Beneﬁt Plans) and non-cash adjustments totaling $6 million in 2016 and $4 million in 2015. At December 31, 2016, $18 million
of our net restructuring liability was recorded within other current liabilities and less than $1 million was recorded within other long-term liabilities.
Implementation Costs:
Implementation costs related to our 2012-2014 Restructuring Program primarily relate to activities in connection with the Kraft Foods Group Spin-Off
such as reorganizing our operations and facilities, the discontinuance of certain product lines and incremental expenses related to the closure of
facilities, replicating our information systems infrastructure and reorganizing our sales function. Within our continuing results of operations, we
recorded implementation costs of $99 million in 2014. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.
