(1) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base business.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method investments in after-tax
equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. As the after-tax equity method investment net earnings for the six months ended December 31, 2015 was
less than $1 million, this line item is not shown on our consolidated statement of earnings. Pre-tax earnings from equity method investments recorded within segment
operating income were $56 million for the six months ended July 2, 2015. See Note 1, Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies — Principles of Consolidation, for
additional information. Equity method investment net earnings were lower in the third quarter of 2016 due to the JDE unfavorable tax expense disclosed in Note 2,
Divestitures and Acquisitions — JDE Tax Matter Resolution .
(2) See the following table for signiﬁcant items that affected the comparability of earnings each quarter.
(3) In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a net loss, primarily due to the loss on deconsolidation of Venezuela and coffee business transaction ﬁnal sales price
adjustment. In accordance with US. GAAP, due to the net loss in the quarter, diluted EPS was equal to basic EPS.
Basic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each of the periods presented. Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not
equal the total for the year.
During 2016 and 2015, we recorded the following pre-tax (charges) / gains in earnings from continuing operations:
