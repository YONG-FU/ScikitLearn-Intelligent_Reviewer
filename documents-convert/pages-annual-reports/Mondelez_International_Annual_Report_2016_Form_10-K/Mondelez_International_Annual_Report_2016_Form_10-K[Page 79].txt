JDE Tax Matter Resolution:
On July 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of Spain reached a ﬁnal resolution on a challenged JDE tax position held by a predecessor DEMB company
that resulted in an unfavorable tax expense of € 114 million. As a result, our share of JDE’s equity earnings during the third quarter of 2016 was
negatively affected by 6 30 million ($34 million).
Keurig Transaction:
On March 3, 2016, a subsidiary of AHBV completed a $13.9 billion acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Keurig through a merger
transaction. On March 7, 2016, we exchanged with a subsidiary of AHBV a portion of our equity interest in JDE with a carrying value of 6 1.7 billion
(approximately $2.0 billion as of March 7, 2016) for an interest in Keurig with a fair value of $2.0 billion based on the merger consideration per share
for Keurig. We recorded the difference between the fair value of Keurig and our basis in JDE shares as a $43 million gain on the equity method
investment exchange in March 2016. Immediately following the exchange, our ownership interest in JDE was 26.5% and our interest in Keurig was
24.2%. Both AHBV and we hold our investments in Keurig through a combination of equity and interests in a shareholder loan, with pro-rata
ownership of each. Our initial $2.0 billion investment in Keurig includes a $1.6 billion Keurig equity interest and a $0.4 billion shareholder loan
receivable, which are reported on a combined basis within equity method investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
The shareholder loan has a 5.5% interest rate and is payable at the end of a seven-year term on February 27, 2023. Vlﬁthin equity method
investment net earnings, we recorded equity earnings of $77 million and interest income from the shareholder loan of $20 million in 2016.
Additionally, we received $14 million of interest payments on the shareholder loan and $4 million in dividends on our investment in Keurig for the year
ended December 31, 2016. We continue to account for our investments in JDE and Keurig under the equity method and recognize our share of their
earnings within equity method investment earnings and our share of their dividends within our cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, Keurig reﬂected
a preliminary acquisition purchase price allocation and related remeasurement updates that we have recorded in our fourth quarter 2016 results. We
anticipate the purchase price allocation work will be ﬁnalized in the first quarter of 2017.
Coffee Business Equity Earnings:
We have reﬂected the results of our historical coffee businesses and equity earnings from JDE, Keurig and DSF in our results from continuing
operations as the coffee category continues to be a significant part of our net earnings and business strategy going fon/vard. Historically, our coffee
businesses and the income from equity method investments were recorded within our operating income as these businesses were part of our base
business. While we retain an ongoing interest in coffee through equity method investments including JDE, Keurig and DSF, and we have signiﬁcant
inﬂuence with our equity method investments, we do not control these operations directly. As such, in the third quarter of 2015, we began to
recognize equity method investment earnings, consisting primarily of investments in coffee businesses, outside of operating income. For periods
prior to the third quarter of 2015, our historical coffee business and equity method investment earnings were included within our operating income.
Of the $301 million equity method investment net earnings in 2016, the contribution from JDE was $100 million, from Keurig was $97 million (since
March 7, 2016), from DSF was $75 million and from all other equity investments was $29 million. In 2015, JDE incurred a $58 million loss, which was
fully offset by earnings of $38 million from DSF and $21 million from other equity method investments. V\ﬁthin operating income for the ﬁrst half of
2015, $296 million after-tax ($342 million pre-tax) earnings related to our legacy coffee business, $40 million was from DSF and $16 million was from
our other equity method investments. In 2014, $572 million ($646 million pre-tax) earnings related to our legacy coffee business, $83 million was
from DSF and $30 million was from our other equity method investments.
