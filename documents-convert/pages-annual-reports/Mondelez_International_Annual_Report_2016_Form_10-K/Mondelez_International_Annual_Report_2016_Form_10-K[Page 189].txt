GUARANTEES
SECTION 1401. Guarantee.
(a) Subject to this Article 14, to the extent provided for in any series of Securities under the Indenture, each of the Guarantors hereby will, jointly and
severally, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee, on a senior unsecured basis, to each Holder and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, irrespective of
the validity and enforceability of this Indenture, such series of Securities or the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (1) the principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Security shall be promptly paid in full when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration, redemption or otherwise, and
interest on the overdue principal and interest on the Securities, if any, if lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or
under the Securities shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (2) in case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other obligations, that same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the terms
of the extension or renewal, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment by the Company when due of any amount so guaranteed or
any performance so guaranteed for whatever reason, the Guarantors shall be jointly and severally obligated to pay the same immediately. Each Guarantor agrees
that this is a guarantee of payment and not a guarantee of collection.
(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, the
recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Guarantor hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants
that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the obligations contained in the Securities and this Indenture, or pursuant to
Section 1406.
(0) Each of the Guarantors also agrees, jointly and severally, to pay any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneysâ€™ fees and
expenses) incurred by the Trustee or any Holder in enforcing any rights under this Section 1401.
(d) If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company, the Guarantors or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other
similar official acting in relation to the Company or the Guarantors, any amount paid either to the Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore
discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect.
(e) Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of subrogation in relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby
until payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders and the
Trustee, on the other hand, (1) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article 5 for the purposes of this Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any
declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 5, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and payable
by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee. The Guarantors shall have the right to seek contribution from any non-paying Guarantor so long as the exercise
of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantees.
