The accumulated benefit obligation, which represents beneﬁts earned to the measurement date, was $1,540 million at December 31, 2016 and
$1,463 million at December 31, 2015 for the U.S. pension plans. The accumulated beneﬁt obligation for the non-U.S. pension plans was
$9,531 million at December 31, 2016 and $9,267 million at December 31, 2015.
For salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after January 1, 2009, we discontinued beneﬁts under our U.S. pension plans and replaced them
with an enhanced Company contribution to our employee deﬁned contribution plan. Effective December 31, 2019, beneﬁt accruals will cease under
the U.S. non-union pension plan. For non-union employees participating in that plan on December 31, 2019, we will calculate the pension beneﬁt
obligation based on pay and service as of that date and no longer accrue new beneﬁts.
The combined U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans resulted in a net pension liability of $1,882 million at December 31, 2016 and $2,145 million at
December 31, 2015. We recognized these amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as follows:
As of December 31,
2016 2015
(in millions)
Prepaid pension assets $ 159 $ 69 l
Other accrued liabilities (2_7) (3_1)
Accrued pension costs (2,014) (2,183)]
§ (1.882,) § (2.145,)
Certain of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans are underfunded and have accumulated beneﬁt obligations in excess of plan assets. For these plans, the
projected beneﬁt obligations, accumulated beneﬁt obligations and the fair value of plan assets were:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans

We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our beneﬁt obligations under the pension plans:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
As of December 31, As of December 31,
2016 2015 2016 2015
:Discount rate 4.19% 4.50% 2.31% 3.11% l
gpected rate of return on plan assets 6.25% 6.75% 5.14% 5.87%
Rate of compensation increase 4.00% 4.00% 3.29% 3.18% l
Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian, Eurozone and UK. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, ﬁxed-income debt
instruments with durations that match the expected future cash ﬂows of the beneﬁt obligations. Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S.
plans were developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were
primarily the result of changes in bond yields year-over-year. We determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets’ historical
long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.
At the end of 2015, we changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for pension beneﬁts. For 2015, we measured service and
interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For 2016, we
measured service and interest costs by applying the speciﬁc spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash ﬂows. We believe the new
approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash ﬂows to the
corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a decrease in net periodic pension cost of approximately $64 million for
the year ended December 31, 2016. This change did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a change
in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.
