the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such
transactions and the process leading thereto. Each Obligor agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or
owes a ﬁduciary or similar duty to such Obligor, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
