Note 10. Stock Plans
Under our Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), we are authorized through May 21, 2024 to issue a maximum of
243.7 million shares of our Common Stock to employees and non-employee directors. As of December 31, 2016, there were 74.2 million shares
available to be granted under the Plan.
Stock Options:
Stock options (including stock appreciation rights) are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the grant
date, generally become exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the ﬁrst anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of ten
years.
We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes methodology to measure stock option
expense at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the vesting period. We recorded
compensation expense related to stock options held by our employees of $57 million in 2016, $50 million in 2015 and $47 million in 2014 in our
results from continuing operations. The deferred tax beneﬁt recorded related to this compensation expense was $15 million in 2016, $13 million in
2015 and $12 million in 2014. The unamortized compensation expense related to our employee stock options was $52 million at December 31, 2016
and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year.
Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions were:
Risk-Free Expected Expected Fair Value
Interest Rate gpected Life Volatility: Dividend Yield at Grant Date
2016 1.40% 6 years 23.11% 1.61% $ 7.86 l
2015 1.70% 6 years 18.51% 1.61 % $ 6.12
2014 1.87% 6 years 21.48% 1.64% $ 6.60 l
The risk-free interest rate represents the constant maturity U.S. government treasuries rate with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the
options. The expected life is the period over which our employees are expected to hold their options. Volatility reflects historical movements in our
stock price for a period commensurate with the expected life of the options. The dividend yield reﬂects the dividend yield in place at the time of the
historical grants.
