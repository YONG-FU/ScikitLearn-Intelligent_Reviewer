Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
We have no signiﬁcant off-balance sheet arrangements other than the contractual obligations discussed below.
Guarantees:
As discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , we enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our
vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At
December 31, 2016, we had no material third-party guarantees recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
In addition, at December 31, 2016, we were contingently liable for $758 million of guarantees related to our own performance. These include letters
of credit, surety bonds and guarantees related to the payment of custom duties and taxes.
Guarantees do not have, and we do not expect them to have, a material effect on our liquidity.
Aggregate Contractual Obligations:
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016.

(1) Amounts include the expected cash payments of our debt excluding capital leases, which are presented separately in the table above. The amounts also
exclude $69 million of net unamortized non-cash bond premiums and discounts and mark—to-market adjustments related to our interest rate swaps recorded in
total debt.
(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt. Interest calculated on our euro, British pound sterling and
Swiss franc notes was forecasted using currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2016. An insigniﬁcant amount of interest expense was excluded from the
table for a portion of our other non—U.S. debt obligations due to the complexities involved in forecasting expected interest payments.
(3) Operating lease payments represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co—manufacturing arrangements,
storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include
commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase
obligations if a contract speciﬁes all signiﬁcant terms, including ﬁxed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the
transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a signiﬁcant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reﬂected on the consolidated
balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(5) Other long-term liabilities include estimated future beneﬁt payments for our postretirement health care plans through December 31, 2026 of $195 million. We
are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2026; as such, they are excluded from the above table. There are also another $179 million
of various other long-term liabilities that are expected to be paid over the next 5 years. In addition, the following long—term liabilities included on the
consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension costs, income taxes, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to
reliably estimate the timing of the payments (or contributions beyond 2017, in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. We currently expect to make
approximately $468 million in contributions to our pension plans in 2017. As of December 31, 2016, our total liability for income taxes, including uncertain tax
positions and associated accrued interest and penalties, was $899 million. We currently estimate payments of approximately $232 million related to these
positions over the next 12 months.
