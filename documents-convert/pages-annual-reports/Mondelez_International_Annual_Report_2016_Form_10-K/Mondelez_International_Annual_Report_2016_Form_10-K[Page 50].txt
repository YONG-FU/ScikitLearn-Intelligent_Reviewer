During 2016, one of our subsidiaries, Mondelez International Holdings Netherlands B.V. (“MIHN”), issued debt totaling $4.5 billion. The operations
held by MIHN generated approximately 74.1 percent (or $19.2 billion) of the $25.9 billion of consolidated net revenue during ﬁscal year 2016 and
represented approximately 81.7 percent (or $20.6 billion) of the $25.2 billion of net assets as of December 31, 2016.
On February 3, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion long-term ﬁnancing authority to replace the prior authority.
In the next 12 months, we expect $1.4 billion of long-term debt will mature as follows: 6 750 million ($789 million as of December 31, 2016) in
January 2017, fr. 175 million Swiss franc notes ($172 million as of December 31, 2016) in March 2017 and $488 million in August 2017. We expect
to fund these repayments with a combination of cash from operations and the issuance of commercial paper or long-term debt.
Our total debt was $17.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and $15.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 0.41 at
December 31, 2016 and 0.35 at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, the weighted-average term of our outstanding long-term debt was 6.6
years. Our average daily commercial borrowings were $2.2 billion in 2016, $2.2 billion in 2015 and $1.9 billion in 2014. We had $2.4 billion of
commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016 and none outstanding as of December 31, 2015, as commercial paper interest
rates continued to be favorable in late 2016 and we had a bond maturity reﬁnanced with commercial paper in December 2016. We expect to continue
to use commercial paper borrowings to ﬁnance various short or long-term ﬁnancing needs. We expect to continue to use commercial paper to
ﬁnance various short and long-term ﬁnancing needs and to comply with our long-term debt covenants. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing
Arrangements , for more information on our debt and debt covenants.
Commodity Trends
We regularly monitor worldwide supply, commodity cost and currency trends so we can cost-effectively secure ingredients, packaging and fuel
required for production. During 2016, the primary drivers of the increase in our aggregate commodity costs were higher currency-related costs on our
commodity purchases and increased costs for packaging and other raw materials, partially offset by lower costs for nuts, dairy, energy, sugar, grains
and oils and cocoa.
A number of external factors such as weather conditions, commodity market conditions, currency ﬂuctuations and the effects of governmental
agricultural or other programs affect the cost and availability of raw materials and agricultural materials used in our products. We address higher
commodity costs and currency impacts primarily through hedging, higher pricing and manufacturing and overhead cost control. We use hedging
techniques to limit the impact of ﬂuctuations in the cost of our principal raw materials; however, we may not be able to fully hedge against commodity
cost changes, and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in speciﬁc raw material costs. Due to competitive or market conditions,
planned trade or promotional incentives, ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates or other factors, our pricing actions may also lag commodity cost
changes temporarily.
We expect price volatility and a slightly higher aggregate cost environment to continue in 2017. While the costs of our principal raw materials
ﬂuctuate, we believe there will continue to be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they will generally remain available from
numerous sources.
