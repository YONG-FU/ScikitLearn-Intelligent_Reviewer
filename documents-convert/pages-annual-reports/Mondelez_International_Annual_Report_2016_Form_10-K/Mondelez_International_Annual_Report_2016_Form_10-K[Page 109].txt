In February 2013 and March 2014, Cadbury India Limited (now known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited), a subsidiary of Mondelez
International, and other parties received show cause notices from the Indian Central Excise Authority (the “Excise Authority”) calling upon the parties
to demonstrate why the Excise Authority should not collect a total of 3.7 billion Indian rupees ($55 million as of December 31, 2016) of unpaid excise
tax and an equivalent amount of penalties, as well as interest, related to production at the same Indian facility. We contested these demands for
unpaid excise taxes, penalties and interest. On March 27, 2015, after several hearings, the Commissioner of the Excise Authority issued an order
denying the excise exemption that we claimed for the Indian facility and conﬁrming the Excise Authority’s demands for total taxes and penalties in the
amount of 5.8 billion Indian rupees ($86 million as of December 31, 2016). We have appealed this order. In addition, the Excise Authority issued
additional show cause notices in February 2015 and December 2015 on the same issue but covering the periods January to October 2014 and
November 2014 to September 2015, respectively. These notices added a total of 2.4 billion Indian rupees ($35 million as of December 31, 2016) of
unpaid excise taxes as well as penalties to be determined up to an amount equivalent to that claimed by the Excise Authority and interest. We
believe that the decision to claim the excise tax beneﬁt is valid and we are continuing to contest the show cause notices through the administrative
and judicial process.
In April 2013, the staff of the US. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) advised us and Kraft Foods Group that it was investigating
activities related to the trading of December 2011 wheat futures contracts that occurred prior to the Spin-Off of Kraft Foods Group. We cooperated
with the staff in its investigation. On April 1, 2015, the CFTC filed a complaint against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez Global LLC (“Mondelez
Global”) in the US. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the “CFTC action”). The complaint alleges that Kraft Foods
Group and Mondelez Global (1) manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 201 1; (2) violated position limit levels for
wheat futures and (3) engaged in non-competitive trades by trading both sides of exchange-for-physical Chicago Board of Trade wheat contracts.
The CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties of either triple the monetary gain for each violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (the “Act”) or $1 million
for each violation of Section 6(c)(1), 6(c)(3) or 9(a)(2) of the Act and $140,000 for each additional violation of the Act, plus post-judgment interest; an
order of permanent injunction prohibiting Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez Global from violating speciﬁed provisions of the Act; disgorgement of
proﬁts; and costs and fees. In December 2015, the court denied Mondelez Global and Kraft Foods Group’s motion to dismiss the CFTC’s claims of
market manipulation and attempted manipulation, and the parties are now in discovery. Additionally, several class action complaints were ﬁled
against Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez Global in the US. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by investors in wheat futures and options
on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The complaints make similar allegations as those made in the CFTC action and seek class
action certiﬁcation; an unspeciﬁed amount for damages, interest and unjust enrichment; costs and fees; and injunctive, declaratory and other
unspeciﬁed relief. In June 2015, these suits were consolidated in the Northern District of Illinois. In June 2016, the court denied Mondelez Global and
Kraft Foods Group’s motion to dismiss, and the parties are now in discovery. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters; however,
based on our Separation and Distribution Agreement with Kraft Foods Group dated as of September 27, 2012, we expect to predominantly bear any
monetary penalties or other payments in connection with the CFTC action.
While we cannot predict with certainty the results of any Legal Matters in which we are currently involved, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to
resolve any of these Legal Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our ﬁnancial results.
Third-Party Guarantees:
We enter into third-party guarantees primarily to cover the long-term obligations of our vendors. As part of these transactions, we guarantee that third
parties will make contractual payments or achieve performance measures. At December 31, 2016, we had no material third-party guarantees
recorded on our consolidated balance sheet.
