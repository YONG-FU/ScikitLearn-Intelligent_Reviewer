2016 compared with 2015:
Net revenues decreased $1,917 million (16.4%), due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business (12.9 pp), unfavorable
currency (4.3 pp) and lower net pricing (0.4 pp), partially offset by favorable volume / mix (1.1 pp) and the impact of an acquisition (0.1 pp). The
adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $1,561 million. Unfavorable
currency impacts reﬂected the strength of the US. dollar against most currencies in the region, primarily the British pound sterling. Lower net pricing
was reflected across most categories except gum and refreshment beverages. Favorable volume / mix, including the unfavorable impact of strategic
decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines, was driven by biscuits, chocolate and cheese & grocery, partially offset by declines in gum,
refreshment beverages and candy. The purchase of the license to manufacture, market and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits in November 2016 added
net revenues of $16 million (constant currency basis).
Segment operating income decreased $83 million (6.1%), primarily due to the deconsolidation of our historical coffee business, unfavorable currency,
higher raw material costs, divestiture-related costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, lower net pricing and higher
intangible asset impairment charges. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with the JDE coffee business
transactions, lower manufacturing costs, lower other selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable volume / mix.
2015 compared with 2014:
Net revenues decreased $4,116 million (26.1%), due to unfavorable currency (16.2 pp), the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee
business (9.4 pp) and unfavorable volume / mix (3.3 pp), partially offset by higher net pricing (2.8 pp). Unfavorable currency impacts primarily
reflected the strength of the US. dollar against most currencies in the region, including the euro and British pound sterling. The adjustment for
deconsolidating our historical coffee business resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net revenues of $2,095 million. Unfavorable volume / mix was
largely due to the impact of pricing-related elasticity as well as strategic decisions to exit certain low-margin product lines. Unfavorable volume / mix
was driven by declines in chocolate, gum, refreshment beverages and cheese & grocery, partially offset by gains in biscuits. Higher net pricing was
driven by chocolate, gum and candy, partially offset by lower net pricing in cheese & grocery and refreshment beverages.
Segment operating income decreased $602 million (30.8%), primarily due to the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business,
unfavorable currency, higher raw material costs, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee
business transactions, unfavorable volume / mix, higher advertising and consumer promotion costs and higher intangible asset impairment charges
related to a candy trademark. These unfavorable items were partially offset by higher net pricing, the lower manufacturing costs, absence of 2012-
2014 Restructuring Program costs and lower other selling, general and administrative expenses (net of the unfavorable year-over-year impact from
the 2014 gain on a sale of property in the United Kingdom).
