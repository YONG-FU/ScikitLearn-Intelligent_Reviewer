We used the following weighted-average assumptions to determine our postretirement beneﬁt obligations:
U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
As of December 31, As of December 31,
2016 2015 2016 2015
Discount rate 4.14% 4.60% 4.55% 4.77% l
Health care cost trend rate
v assumed for next year 6.50% 6.50% 5.50% 5.37%
[Ultimate trend rate 5.00% 5.00% 5.68% 5.55% I
Year that the rate reaches the
ultimate trend rate 2020 2020 2018 2018
Year-end discount rates for our U.S., Canadian and UK. plans were developed from a model portfolio of high quality, ﬁxed-income debt instruments
with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations. Year-end discount rates for our remaining non-U.S. plans were
developed from local bond indices that match local beneﬁt obligations as closely as possible. Changes in our discount rates were primarily the result
of changes in bond yields year-over-year. Our expected health care cost trend rate is based on historical costs.
At the end 2015, we changed the approach used to measure service and interest costs for other postretirement beneﬁts. For 2015, we measured
service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. For
2016, we measured service and interest costs by applying the speciﬁc spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash ﬂows. We believe
the new approach provided a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash ﬂows to the
corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. The impact of this change was a decrease in net periodic postretirement cost of approximately $4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change does not affect the measurement of our plan obligations. We accounted for this change as a
change in accounting estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it on a prospective basis.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a signiﬁcant impact on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in
assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Net periodic postretirement health care costs consisted of the following:

(1) For the year ended December 31, 2016, amortization of prior service credit includes $9 million of curtailment gain related to a change in the eligibility
requirement.
As of December 31, 2016, we expected to amortize from accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) into pre-tax net periodic
postretirement health care costs during 2017:
0 an estimated $15 million of net loss from experience differences, and
o an estimated $40 million of prior service credit.
