Equity and Dividends
Stock Plans:
See Note 10, Stock Plans , to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for more information on our stock plans and grant activity during 2016, 2015 and
2014.
Share Repurchases:
See Note 11, Capital Stock , to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our share repurchase and accelerated share
repurchase programs.
We intend to continue to use a portion of our cash for share repurchases. On July 29, 2015, our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated
from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of
Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018. We repurchased $10.8 billion of shares ($2.6 billion in 2016,
$3.6 billion in 2015, $1.9 billion in 2014 and $2.7 billion in 2013) through December 31, 2016. The number of shares that we ultimately repurchase
under our share repurchase program may vary depending on numerous factors, including share price and other market conditions, our ongoing
capital allocation planning, levels of cash and debt balances, other demands for cash, such as acquisition activity, general economic or business
conditions and board and management discretion. Additionally, our share repurchase activity during any particular period may ﬂuctuate. We may
accelerate, suspend, delay or discontinue our share repurchase program at any time, without notice.
Dividends:
We paid dividends of $1 ,094 million in 2016, $1,008 million in 2015 and $964 million in 2014. On July 19, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a
12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per common share or $0.76 per common share on an annual basis. On July 23, 2015, our Board of
Directors approved a 13% increase at that time in the quarterly dividend to $0.17 per common share or $0.68 per common share on an annual basis.
On August 5, 2014, our Audit Committee, with authorization from our Board of Directors, approved a 7% increase at that time in the quarterly
dividend to $0.15 per common share or $0.60 per common share on an annual basis. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our
Board of Directors and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, ﬁnancial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other
factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
For U.S. income tax purposes only, the Company has calculated that 100% of the distributions paid to its shareholders in January 2016 are
characterized as a qualified dividend paid from U.S. earnings and proﬁts. The distributions the Company paid to its shareholders in April, July and
October are characterized as a return of capital to each shareholder, up to the extent of the shareholder’s tax basis. If a shareholder does not have
sufﬁcient tax basis, these distributions could result in taxable gains to the shareholder. Shareholders should consult their tax advisors for a full
understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends, including distributions in excess of our US. earnings and profits.
