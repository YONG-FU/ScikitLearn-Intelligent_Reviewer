The only individually signiﬁcant multiemployer plan we participate in as of December 31, 2016 is the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry
International Pension Fund (the “Fund”). Our contributions to the Fund exceeded 5% of total contributions to the Fund for ﬁscal years 2016, 2015 and
2014. Our contributions to the Fund were $21 million in 2016, $27 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. Our contributions to other multiemployer
pension plans that were not individually signiﬁcant were $4 million in 2016, $4 million in 2015 and $7 million in 2014. Our contributions are based on
our contribution rates under our collective bargaining agreements, the number of our eligible employees and Fund surcharges.

Effective January 1, 2012, the Fund’s zone status changed to “Red”. As a result of this certiﬁcation, beginning in July 2012, we were charged a 10%
surcharge on our contribution rates. The Fund subsequently adopted a rehabilitation plan on November 7, 2012 that required contribution increases
and reductions to beneﬁt provisions. Although our collective bargaining agreements with the Fund expired during 2016, we are obligated to make
contributions to the Fund and we continue to work with the union toward reaching an agreement. The Fund’s actuarial valuation was last completed
as of January 1, 2016. As of August 28, 2016, the 10% surcharge is no longer applicable but we are required to pay higher contributions under the
Fund’s rehabilitation plan.
Other Costs:
We sponsor and contribute to employee deﬁned contribution plans. These plans cover eligible salaried, non-union and union employees. Our
contributions and costs are determined by the matching of employee contributions, as deﬁned by the plans. Amounts charged to expense in
continuing operations for deﬁned contribution plans totaled $44 million in 2016, $45 million in 2015 and $46 million in 2014.
