(e) Sale of Participation . Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Loans owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it), subject
to the following:
(i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower hereunder) shall remain
unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) Mondeléz, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
(iv) each participant shall be entitled to the beneﬁts of Sections 2.12 and 2.15 (subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections,
including the requirements to provide forms and/or certificates pursuant to Section 2.15(e), (f) or (g)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section,
(v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any
consent to any departure by the Borrower or Mondeléz therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of,
or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date ﬁxed
for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Loans or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, and
(vi) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 and 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with reSpect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with the Borrower’s
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each participant and the principal and interest amounts of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this
Agreement (the “ Participant Register ”). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person
whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other Obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other Obligation is in registered form under Section 5f103(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, if
different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(0) of the Code.
