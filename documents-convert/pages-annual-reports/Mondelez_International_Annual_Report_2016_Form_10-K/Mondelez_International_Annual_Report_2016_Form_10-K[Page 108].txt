Stock plan awards to employees and non-employee directors are issued from treasury shares. At December 31, 2016, 134 million shares of
Common Stock held in treasury were reserved for stock options and other stock awards.
Share Repurchase Program:
During 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $7.7 billion of our Common Stock through December 31, 2016. On July 29, 2015,
our Finance Committee, with authorization delegated from our Board of Directors, approved an increase of $6.0 billion in the share repurchase
program, raising the authorization to $13.7 billion of Common Stock repurchases, and extended the program through December 31, 2018.
Repurchases under the program are determined by management and are wholly discretionary. Prior to January 1, 2016, we had repurchased
$8.2 billion of Common Stock pursuant to this authorization. During 2016, we repurchased 62.0 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost
of $41 .97 per share, or an aggregate cost of $2.6 billion, all of which was paid during 2016. All share repurchases were funded through available
cash and commercial paper issuances. During 2015, we repurchased 91.9 million shares of Common Stock at an average cost of $39.43 per share,
or an aggregate cost of $3.6 billion, all of which was paid during 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we have $2.8 billion in remaining share repurchase
capacity.
In December 2013, we initiated an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program. On December 3, 2013, we paid $1.7 billion and received an initial
delivery of 44.8 million shares of Common Stock valued at $1.5 billion. We increased treasury stock by $1.5 billion, and the remaining $0.2 billion
was recorded against additional paid in capital. In May 2014, the ASR program concluded and we received an additional 5.1 million shares, valued at
$0.2 billion, for a total of 49.9 million shares with an average repurchase price of $34.10 per share over the life of the ASR program. The ﬁnal
settlement was based on the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock during the purchase period less a ﬁxed per share discount. Upon
conclusion of the ASR program and receipt of the remaining repurchased shares, the $0.2 billion recorded in additional paid in capital was
reclassiﬁed to treasury stock.
Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings:
We routinely are involved in legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations (“Legal Matters”) arising in the ordinary course
of our business.
As we previously disclosed in February 2011, we received a subpoena from the SEC in connection with an investigation under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (“FCPA”), primarily related to a facility in India that we acquired in the Cadbury acquisition. The subpoena primarily requested
information regarding dealings with Indian governmental agencies and ofﬁcials to obtain approvals related to the operation of that facility. In January
2017, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle charges related to internal controls and books-and-records provisions of the FCPA without
admitting or denying the charges. As part of the settlement, Mondeléz International Inc. agreed to pay a civil penalty of $13 million to resolve the
investigation. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or ﬁnancial condition as a result of resolving this matter.
