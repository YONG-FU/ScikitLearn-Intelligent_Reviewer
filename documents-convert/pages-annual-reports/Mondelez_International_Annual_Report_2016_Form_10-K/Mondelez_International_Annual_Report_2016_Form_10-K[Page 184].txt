Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any Security of any
series, such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional amounts provided for in the terms of such Securities and this Section to the

the payment of additional amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional amounts in those provisions hereof where
such express mention is not made.
If the Securities of a series provide for the payment of additional amounts as contemplated by Section 301(20), at least 10 days prior to the ﬁrst Interest
Payment Date with respect to that series of Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to maturity, the ﬁrst day on which a payment of
principal and any premium is made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, if there has been any
change with reSpect to the matters set forth in the below mentioned Ofﬁcers’ Certificate, the Company will furnish the Trustee for that series of Securities and the
Company’s principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than such Trustee, with an Ofﬁcers’ Certiﬁcate instructing such Trustee and such Paying Agent or
Paying Agents whether such payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities
of that series who are United States Aliens without withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental charge referred to above or
described in the Securities of that series. If any such withholding shall be required, then such Ofﬁcers’ Certificate shall specify by country the amount, if any,
required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of Securities and the Company will pay to the Trustee for such series of Securities or such Paying Agent
such additional amounts as may be required pursuant to the terms applicable to such series. The Company covenants to indemnify the Trustee for such series of

misconduct on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Ofﬁcers’ Certificate furnished pursuant to
this Section 1010. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holder to determine the additional
amounts, or with respect to the nature, extent, or calculation of the amount of any additional amounts owed, or with respect to the method employed in such
calculation of any additional amounts.
