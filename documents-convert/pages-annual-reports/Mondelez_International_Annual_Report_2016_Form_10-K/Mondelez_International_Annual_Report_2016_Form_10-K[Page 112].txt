Our 2016 effective tax rate of 8.9% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and net tax beneﬁts
from $161 million of discrete one-time events. The discrete net tax beneﬁts related to favorable audit settlements and statutes of limitations in various
jurisdictions and the net reduction of our U.K. and French deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2016 that reduced the
corporate income tax rates in each country.
Our 2015 effective tax rate of 7.5% was favorably impacted by the one-time third quarter sale of our coffee business that resulted in a pre—tax gain of
$6,809 million and $184 million of related tax expense, as well as $27 million of tax costs incurred to remit proceeds up from lower-tier foreign
subsidiaries to allow cash to be redeployed within our retained foreign operations. The benefit of the third quarter transaction was partially offset by
the tax costs associated with the sale of our interest in AGF in the ﬁrst half of the year and the impact of deconsolidating our Venezuelan operations
on December 31, 2015. Excluding the impacts of these transactions, our effective tax rate would have been 17.8%, reﬂecting favorable impacts from
the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and net tax beneﬁts from $119 million of discrete one-time events. The remaining
discrete one-time events primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations in several jurisdictions and the
net reduction of U.K. deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax legislation enacted during 2015 that reduced the U.K. corporate income tax rate.
Our 2014 effective tax rate of 13.8% was favorably impacted by the mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. tax jurisdictions and net tax beneﬁts
from $206 million of discrete one-time events. The discrete net tax beneﬁts primarily related to favorable tax audit settlements and expirations of
statues of limitations in several jurisdictions.
The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

At December 31, 2016, the company has pre—tax loss carryfonNards of $3,517 million, of which $1,223 million will expire at various dates between
2017 and 2036 and the remaining $2,294 million can be carried fonNard indeﬁnitely.
Our significant valuation allowances relate to loss carryfon/vards in Mexico and Ireland where we do not currently expect to generate gains of the
proper character to utilize the carryfonNards in the future.
At December 31, 2016, neither applicable U.S. federal income taxes nor foreign withholding taxes have been provided on approximately $19.8 billion
of accumulated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be indeﬁnitely reinvested. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indeﬁnitely reinvested earnings. Future tax law changes or changes in the needs of our non-U.S.
subsidiaries could require us to recognize deferred tax liabilities on a portion, or all, of our accumulated earnings that were previously expected to be
indefinitely reinvested.
