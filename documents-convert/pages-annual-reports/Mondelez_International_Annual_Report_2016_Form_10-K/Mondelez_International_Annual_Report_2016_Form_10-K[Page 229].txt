(i) the date and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period
applicable thereto;
(ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it;
(iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder and the

(0) Evidence of Payment Obligations . Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the Register pursuant to Section 2.17(b), and by
each Lender in its account or accounts pursuant to Section 2.17(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to

Agreement, absent manifest error; provided , however , that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is
incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower under this Agreement.
SECTION 2.18 Commitmentjncreases.
(a) Mondeléz may from time to time (but not more than three times in any calendar year), by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall
promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders), executed by Mondeléz and one or more financial institutions (any such financial institution referred to in this
Section 2.18 being called an “ Augmenting Lender ”), which may include any Lender, cause new Commitments to be extended by the Augmenting Lenders or cause
the existing Commitments of the Augmenting Lenders to be increased, as the case may be (the aggregate amount of such increase for all Augmenting Lenders on
any single occasion being referred to as a “ Commitmentlncrease”), in an amount for each Augmenting Lender set forth in such notice; providedthat (i) the
amount of each Commitment Increase shall be not less than $25,000,000, except to the extent necessary to utilize the remaining unused amount of increase
permitted under this Section 2.18(a), and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Commitment Increases shall not exceed $500,000,000, provided further that, each Lender
may, in its sole discretion, elect to participate or decline to participate in any Commitment Increase. Each Augmenting Lender (if not then a Lender) shall be
subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall not be subject to the approval of any
other Lenders, and Mondeléz and each Augmenting Lender shall execute all such documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence
the Commitment of such Augmenting Lender and/or its status as a Lender hereunder (such documentation in respect of any Commitment Increase together with the
notice of such Commitment Increase being referred to collectively as the “ CornmitmentjncreaseiAmendment,” in respect of such Commitment Increase). The
Commitment Increase Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement as may be necessary or appropriate,
in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.18.
