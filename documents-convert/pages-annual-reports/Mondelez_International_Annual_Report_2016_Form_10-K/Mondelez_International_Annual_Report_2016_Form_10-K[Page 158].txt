SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.
Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any particular series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.
SECTION 311. Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
Unless otherwise specified in accordance with Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) below, principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on Securities of any series denominated in a
Foreign Currency or currency unit will be payable by the Company in Dollars based on the equivalent of that Foreign Currency or currency unit converted into
Dollars in the manner described in paragraph (c) below.
(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 301 with reSpect to Registered Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit
that Holders shall have the option, subject to paragraph ((1) below, to receive payments of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on such Registered
Securities in such Foreign Currency or currency unit by delivering to the Trustee (or to any duly appointed Paying Agent) for the Registered Securities of that series
a written election, to be in form and substance satisfactory to such Trustee (or to any such Paying Agent), not later than the close of business on the Election Date
immediately preceding the applicable payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in such Foreign Currency or currency unit, such election will
remain in effect for such Holder until changed by such Holder by written notice to the Trustee (or to any such Paying Agent) for the Registered Securities of that
series; provided, however, that any such change must be made not later than the close of business on the Election Date immediately preceding the next payment
date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date; and provided, further, that no such change or election may be made with respect to payments
to be made on any Registered Security of such series with reSpect to which an Event of Default has occurred, the Company has exercised any defeasance,
satisfaction or discharge options pursuant to Article Four or notice of redemption has been given by the Company pursuant to Article Eleven. If any Holder makes
any such election, such election will not be effective as to any transferee of such Holder and such transferee shall be paid in Dollars unless such transferee makes an
election as specified above; provided, however, that such election, if in effect while funds are on deposit with respect to the Registered Securities of such series as
described in Section 404 or 405, will be effective on any transferee of such Holder unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for such Registered
Securities. Any Holder of any such Registered Security who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee (or to any duly appointed Paying Agent) for
the Registered Securities of such series not later than the close of business on the applicable Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment
date in Dollars.
(c) With respect to any Registered Securities of any series denominated in a Foreign Currency or currency unit and payable in Dollars, the amount of
Dollars so payable will be determined by the Currency Determination Agent based on the indicative quotation in The City of New York selected by the Currency
Determination Agent at approximately 11:00 am, New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date that yields the largest
number of Dollars on conversion of Foreign Currency or currency units. Such selection shall be made from among the quotations appearing on the bank composite
or multi-contributor pages of the Reuters Monitor Foreign Exchange Service or, if not available, the Bridge Telerate Monitor Foreign Exchange Service, for three
(or two if three are not available) major banks in The City of New York. The first three (or two) such banks selected by the Currency Determination Agent which
are offering quotes on the Reuters Foreign Exchange Service, as the case may be, shall be used. If such quotations are unavailable from either such foreign
exchange service, such selection shall be made from the quotations received by the Currency Determination Agent from no more than three nor less than two
recognized foreign exchange dealers in The City of New York selected by the Currency Determination Agent and approved by the Company (one of which may be
the Currency Determination Agent) for the purchase by the quoting dealer, for settlement on such payment date, of the aggregate amount of the Foreign Currency or
currency unit payable on such payment date in respect of all Registered Securities denominated in such Foreign Currency or currency unit and for which the
applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If fewer than two such bid quotations are available at 11:00 am, New York City time, on the second Business Day
preceding the applicable payment date, such payment will be based on the Market Exchange Rate as of the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment
date. If the Market Exchange Rate for such date is not then available, payments shall be made in the Foreign Currency or currency unit.
((1) If a Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign Currency or currency unit in which Registered Securities of any series are payable, then
with respect to each date for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Registered Securities of that series occurring after the last date on
which such Foreign Currency or currency unit was used, the Company may make such payment in Dollars. The Dollar amount to be paid by the Company to the
Trustee for the Registered Securities of such series and by such Trustee or any Paying Agent for the Registered Securities of such series to the Holders of such
Registered Securities with respect to such payment date shall be determined by the Currency Determination Agent on the basis of the Market Exchange Rate as of
the second Business Day preceding the applicable payment date or, if such Market Exchange Rate is not then available, on the basis of the most recently available
Market Exchange Rate, or as otherwise established pursuant to Section 301 with respect to such Notes. Any payment in respect of such Registered Security made
under such circumstances in Dollars will not constitute an Event of Default hereunder.
