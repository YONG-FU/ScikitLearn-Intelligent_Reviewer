We excluded plan assets of $62 million at December 31, 2016 and $66 million at December 31, 2015 from the above tables related to certain
insurance contracts as they are reported at contract value, in accordance with authoritative guidance.
Fair value measurements:
0 Level 1 — includes primarily US and non-U.S. equity securities and government bonds valued using quoted prices in active markets.
0 Level 2 — includes primarily pooled funds, including assets in real estate pooled funds, valued using net asset values of participation units
held in common collective trusts, as reported by the managers of the trusts and as supported by the unit prices of actual purchase and
sale transactions. Level 2 plan assets also include corporate bonds and other ﬁxed-income securities, valued using independent
observable market inputs, such as matrix pricing, yield curves and indices.
° Level 3 — includes investments valued using unobservable inputs that reﬂect the plans’ assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the assets, based on the best information available.
° Fair value estimates for pooled funds are calculated by the investment advisor when reliable quotations or pricing services are not
readily available for certain underlying securities. The estimated value is based on either cost or last sale price for most of the
securities valued in this fashion.
° Fair value estimates for private equity investments are calculated by the general partners using the market approach to estimate
the fair value of private investments. The market approach utilizes prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions, type of security, degree of liquidity, restrictions on the disposition, latest round of financing data, company ﬁnancial
statements, relevant valuation multiples and discounted cash flow analyses.
° Fair value estimates for real estate investments are calculated by the investment managers using the present value of future cash
ﬂows expected to be received from the investments, based on valuation methodologies such as appraisals, local market
conditions, and current and projected operating performance.
° Fair value estimates for investments in hedge fund-of-funds are calculated by the investment managers using the net asset value
per share of the investment as reported by the money managers of the underlying funds.
° Fair value estimates for certain fixed-income securities such as insurance contracts are calculated based on the future stream of
benefit payments discounted using prevailing interest rates based on the valuation date.
° Net asset value — primarily includes real estate funds, hedge funds and private equity investments for which net asset values are
normally used.
