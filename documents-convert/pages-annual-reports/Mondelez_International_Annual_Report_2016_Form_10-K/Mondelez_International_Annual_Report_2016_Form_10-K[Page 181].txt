Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee for the Securities of any series all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be

Agent to such Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
SECTION 1004. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental
charges levied or imposed upon it or upon its income, proﬁts or property, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law

assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
SECTION 1005. Statements as to Compliance.
The Company will deliver to the Trustee for each series of Securities, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, a written statement

Indenture Act stating that:
(1) a review of the activities of the Company during such year and of performance under this Indenture has been made under his supervision; and

For purposes of this Section, such compliance shall be determined without regard to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided under this
Indenture.
SECTION 1006. Corporate Existence.
Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence,
rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any right or franchise if the Board of Directors

any material respect to the Holders.
SECTION 1007. Limitations on Liens.
(a) Except as expressly provided in Subsection (b) of this Section 1007, the Company will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary to, create, assume, incur or
suffer to be created, assumed or incurred, any mortgage, pledge, lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance (all of the foregoing being hereinafter referred to as
“liens”) to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money (i) upon any shares of Capital Stock issued by any Subsidiary that owns any Principal Facility (as
hereinafter defined) to the extent such shares are owned by the Company or one or more Subsidiaries or (ii) upon any Principal Facility, in either case without
making effective provision whereby all the Securities shall be directly secured equally and ratably with the indebtedness secured by such lien, so long as any such
indebtedness shall be so secured; provided, however, that this Section 1007 shall not be applicable to the following:
(1) in the case of a Principal Facility, liens incurred in connection with the issuance by a state or political subdivision thereof of any securities the
interest on which is exempt from federal income taxes by virtue of Section 103 of the Code or any other laws or regulations in effect at the time of such
issuance;
(2) liens existing on the date hereof;
(3) liens on property or shares of Capital Stock existing when acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary (including acquisition through merger, share
exchange or consolidation) or securing the payment of all or part of the purchase price, construction or improvement thereof incurred prior to, at the time of,
or within 180 days after the later of the acquisition, completion of construction or improvement or commencement of full operation of such property for the
purpose of financing all or a portion of such purchase or construction or improvement; or
(4) liens for the sole purpose of extending, renewing or replacing in whole or in part the indebtedness secured by any lien referred to in the foregoing
clauses (1) through (3) or in this clause (4); provided, however, that the principal amount of indebtedness secured thereby shall not exceed the principal
amount of indebtedness so secured at the time of such extension, renewal or replacement, and that such extension, renewal or replacement shall be limited to
all or a part of the property which secured the lien so extended, renewed or replaced (plus improvements on such property).
