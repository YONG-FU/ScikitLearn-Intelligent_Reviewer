Company’s obligations under this Indenture with respect to the applicable series of Securities except for those surviving obligations specified in this Article Four.

indemnify the Trustee for the Securities of a particular series against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to Section 404 or 405 with respect to the Securities of that series or the principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax,

Obligations held by them at any time that are not required for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on the Securities for which cash
or Government Obligations have been deposited pursuant to Section 404 or 405. Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent for the Securities of
any series, or then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of principal of, and premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any Security of any particular series
and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, and interest, if any, has become due and payable shall, unless otherwise required
by mandatory provisions of applicable escheat, or abandoned or unclaimed property law, be paid to the Company on Company Request or (if then held by the
Company) shall be discharged from such trusts; and the Holder of such Security shall, thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment thereof, and all liability of such Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that such Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment may give written notice to the
Holder of such Security in the manner set forth in Section 106, that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less
than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will, unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of
applicable escheat, or abandoned or unclaimed property law, be repaid to the Company, as the case may be.
SECTION 410. Reinstatement.
If the Trustee or Paying Agent for a series of Securities is unable to apply any cash or Government Obligations, as applicable, in accordance with
Section 402, 403, 404 or 405 by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining
or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of that series shall be revived and reinstated as though
no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 402, 403, 404 or 405 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent for that series is permitted to apply all such cash or
Government Obligations in accordance with Section 402, 403, 404 or 405; provided, however, that if the Company has made any payment of principal of, and
premium, if any, and interest, if any, on any Securities because of the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders
of such Securities to receive such payment from the cash or Government Obligations, as applicable, held by such Trustee or Paying Agent.
