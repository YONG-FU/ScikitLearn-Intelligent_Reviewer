Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the quarter ended
December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we worked with outsourced partners to further simplify and standardize processes
and focus on scalable, transactional processes across all regions. Speciﬁcally during the fourth quarter of 2016, we continued to migrate some of our
procurement administration functions for Middle East, Africa and Turkey to an outsourced partner. Additionally, we continued to transition some of
our transactional data processing as well as ﬁnancial and local tax reporting for a number of countries in all regions (including order-to-cash in our
Europe and AMEA regions) to three outsourced partners. Pursuant to our service agreements, the controls previously established around these
accounting functions will be maintained by our outsourced partners or by us, and they are subject to management’s internal control testing. There
were no other changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
