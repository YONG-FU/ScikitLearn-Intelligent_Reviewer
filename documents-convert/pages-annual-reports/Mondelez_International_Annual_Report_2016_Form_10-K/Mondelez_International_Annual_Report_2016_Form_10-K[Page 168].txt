SECTION 516. Judgment Currency.
If, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment in any court with respect to any obligation of the Company hereunder or under any Security, it shall become
necessary to convert any amount in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security into any other currency or currency unit, then such
conversion shall be made by the Currency Determination Agent at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the date of entry of the judgment (the “Judgment
Date”). If pursuant to any such judgment, conversion shall be made on a date (the “Substitute Date”) other than the Judgment Date and there shall occur a change
between the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date and the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Substitute Date, the Company agrees to pay
such additional amounts (if any) as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid is equal to the amount in such other currency or currency unit which, when
converted at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date, is the amount due hereunder or under such Security. Any amount due from the Company
under this Section 516 shall be due as a separate debt and is not to be affected by or merged into any judgment being obtained for any other sums due hereunder or
in reSpect of any Security. In no event, however, shall the Company be required to pay more in the currency or currency unit due hereunder or under such Security
at the Market Exchange Rate as in effect on the Judgment Date than the amount of currency or currency unit stated to be due hereunder or under such Security so
that in any event the Company’s obligations hereunder or under such Security will be effectively maintained as obligations in such currency or currency unit, and
the Company shall be entitled to withhold (or be reimbursed for, as the case may be) any excess of the amount actually realized upon any such conversion on the
Substitute Date over the amount due and payable on the Judgment Date.
Article Six
THE TRUSTEE
SECTION 601. Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
(a) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series for which the Trustee is serving as such,
(1) such Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Indenture against such Trustee; and
(2) in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, such Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to such Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
but in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are specifically required to be furnished to such Trustee, such Trustee shall
be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the
accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(b) In case an Event of Default with reSpect to a series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee for the Securities of such series shall exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use
under the circumstances in the conduct of such person’s own affairs.
(0) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee for Securities of any series from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of Subsection (a) of this Section;
(2) such Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee
was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(3) such Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction
of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any particular series, determined as provided in Sections 104
and 512, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to such Trustee, or exercising any trust or power
conferred upon such Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series; and
(4) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee for any series of Securities to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any liability,
financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for
believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
(d) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection
to the Trustee for any series of Securities shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
