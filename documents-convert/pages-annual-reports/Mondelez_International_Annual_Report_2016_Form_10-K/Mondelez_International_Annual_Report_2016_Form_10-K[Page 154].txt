Unless otherwise specified in such temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security, any such exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial
owners of such temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security, except that a Person receiving deﬁnitive Securities must bear the cost of insurance,
postage, tranSportation and the like in the event that such Person does not take delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of Euroclear or
Clearstream.
Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, any temporary Global Security or permanent Global Security shall in all respects be entitled to the same
beneﬁts under this Indenture as deﬁnitive Securities of the same series and with like terms and conditions, except as to payment of interest, if any, authenticated and
delivered hereunder. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on such temporary Global Security on an Interest Payment Date
for Securities of such series shall be payable to Euroclear and Clearstream on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and Clearstream to the Trustee
for the Securities of the apprOpriate series or the Global Exchange Agent in the case of payment of interest on a temporary Global Security with respect to an
Interest Payment Date occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date of a certiﬁcate or certificates substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit C to this
Indenture, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneﬁcial owners of such
Global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have, in the case of payment of interest on a temporary Global Security with respect to an Interest Payment
Date occurring prior to the applicable Exchange Date, each delivered to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, a certiﬁcate substantially in the form set forth
in Exhibit D to this Indenture.
With respect to Exhibits A, B, C and D to this Indenture, the Company may, in its discretion and if required or desirable under applicable law, substitute one
or more other forms of such exhibits for such exhibits, eliminate the requirement that any or all certiﬁcates be provided, or change the time that any certiﬁcate may
be required, provided that such substitute form or forms or notice of elimination or change of such certification requirement have theretofore been delivered to the
Trustee with a Company Request and such form or forms, elimination or change is reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Ofﬁce of the Trustee for the Securities of each series a register (the register maintained in such
office being herein sometimes referred to as the “Security Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall
provide for the registration of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The Trustee for the Securities of each series is hereby initially
appointed “Security Registrar” for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered Securities of such series as herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any particular series at the ofﬁce or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment
for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for the Securities of each series shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Registered Securities of any authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal
amount and with like terms and conditions.
Except as set forth below, at the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any particular series may be exchanged for other Registered Securities of any
authorized denominations, and of a like Stated Maturity and of a like series and aggregate principal amount and with like terms and conditions, upon surrender of
the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such ofﬁce or agency. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Section 304, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Registered Securities in definitive
form, a Global Security representing all or a portion of the Registered Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such
series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any
such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary. Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility
or liability for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee for such Securities shall authenticate and deliver, the
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
