The VAR model assumes normal market conditions, a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period. A parametric delta-gamma
approximation technique was used to determine the expected return distribution in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices for the purpose of
calculating the ﬁxed income, currency exchange and commodity VAR, respectively. The parameters used for estimating the expected return
distributions were determined by observing interest rate, currency exchange, and commodity price movements over the prior quarter for the
calculation of VAR amounts at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and over each of the four prior quarters for the calculation of average VAR amounts
during each year. The values of currency and commodity options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency or commodity
and were valued accordingly in the VAR computation.
As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest rate-sensitive instruments,
primarily debt, and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from our currency and commodity instruments, as calculated in the VAR
model, were:
Pre-Tax Earnings Impact Fair Value Impact
At 12/31/16 Average High Low At 12l31l16 Average High Low

The impacts in the 2015 tables above have not been recast to reﬂect the deconsolidation of our legacy coffee business or Venezuela business and
the related derivative activity for those businesses as it is impracticable to do so.
This VAR computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum expected daily loss, under the speciﬁed conﬁdence
interval and assuming normal market conditions, from adverse movements in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The
computation does not represent actual losses in fair value or earnings we will incur, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market
rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in market rates and do not present these VAR results to be indicative of future movements in
market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future financial results.
