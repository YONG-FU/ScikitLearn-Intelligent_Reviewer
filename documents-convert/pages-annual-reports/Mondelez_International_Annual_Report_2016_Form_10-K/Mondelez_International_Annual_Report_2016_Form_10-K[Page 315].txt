(f) If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any Note would be subject to US. federal withholding tax imposed pursuant to FATCA if such
Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Sections 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall provide each of the Administrative Agent, Mondeléz and the Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by law and
as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, Mondeléz or the Borrower, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, Mondeléz or the
Borrower as may be necessary for the Administrative Agent, Mondeléz or the Borrower to comply with their obligations under F ATCA and to determine whether
such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Thereafter, each such
Lender shall provide additional documentation (i) to the extent documentation previously provided has become inaccurate or invalid or has otherwise ceased to be
effective or (ii) as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, Mondeléz or the Borrower. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f), “FATCA” shall include
any amendments made to F ATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(g) Each Lender shall promptly complete and deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, or, at their request, to the applicable taxing
authority, so long as such Lender is legally eligible to do so, any certificate or form reasonably requested in writing by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
and required by applicable law in order to secure any applicable exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any withholding taxes imposed by the Netherlands for
which the Borrower or Mondeléz is required (or would otherwise be required) to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15.
(h) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.15 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to select or change the jurisdiction of its Domestic Lending Office if the making of such a selection or change would
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender be
otherwise materially economically disadvantageous to such Lender.
(i) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Borrower and Mondeléz and to any successor Administrative Agent any
documentation provided by such Lender to the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (e), (f) or (g) of this Section 2.15.
(j) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, obtains a refund of any Tax for which payment has been made pursuant to this
Section 2.15, or, in lieu of obtaining such refund, such Lender or the Administrative Agent applies the amount that would otherwise have been refunded as a credit
against payment of a liability in respect of taxes, which refund or credit in the good faith judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
(and without any obligation to disclose its tax records) is allocable to such payment made under this Section 2.15, the amount of such refund or credit (together with
any interest received thereon and reduced by reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in obtaining such refund or credit and by any applicable taxes) promptly shall
be paid to the Borrower to the extent payment has been made in full by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.15.
