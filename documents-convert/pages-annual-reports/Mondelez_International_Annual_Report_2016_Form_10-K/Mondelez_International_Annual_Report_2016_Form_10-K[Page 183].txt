The Company will, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth below, pay to the Holder of any Security who is a United States Alien such additional
amounts as may be necessary so that every net payment on such Security, after deduction or withholding by the Company or any of its Paying Agents for or on
account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed upon or as a result of such payment by the United States (or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein), will not be less than the amount provided in such Security to be then due and payable. However, the Company
will not make any payment of additional amounts if the Holder is subject to taxation solely for reasons other than its ownership of the Security, nor will the
Company make any payment of additional amounts for or on account of:
(a) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the existence of any present or former connection
(other than the mere fact of being a Holder of a Security) between such Holder (or between a ﬁduciary, settlor, beneﬁciary or person holding a power over
such Holder, if such Holder is an estate or trust, or a member or shareholder of such Holder, if such Holder is a partnership or corporation) and the United
States, including, without limitation, such Holder (or such ﬁduciary, settlor, beneficiary, person holding a power, member or shareholder) being or having
been a citizen, resident of the United States or treated as a resident thereof;
(b) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or

corporation) (i) being or having been present in, or engaged in a trade or business in, the United States, (ii) being treated as having been present in, or
engaged in a trade or business in, the United States, or (iii) having or having had a permanent establishment in the United States;
(c) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld solely by reason of the Holder (or a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary or
person holding a power over such Holder, if such Holder is an estate or trust, or a member or shareholder of such Holder, if such Holder is a partnership or
corporation) being or having been with respect to the United States a personal holding company, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign personal holding
company, a passive foreign investment company, or a foreign private foundation or other foreign tax-exempt organization, or being a corporation that
accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;
((1) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on a Holder that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the total combined
voting power of all classes of stock of the Company entitled to vote within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3) of the Code;
(e) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation by the Holder for payment on a
date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever
occurs later;
(f) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is payable by any method other than withholding or deduction by the Company or any
Paying Agent from payments in respect of such Security;
(g) any gift, estate, inheritance, sales, transfer, personal prOperty or excise tax or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;
(h) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge required to be withheld by any Paying Agent from any payment in reSpect of any Security if such
payment can be made without such withholding by at least one other Paying Agent;
(i) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of a change in law, regulation or administrative or judicial
interpretation that becomes effective more than 15 days after the payment becomes due or is duly provided for, whichever occurs later;
(1') any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed as a result of the failure to comply with applicable certiﬁcation, information,
documentation or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or beneficial
owner of a Security, if such compliance is required by statute or by regulation of the United States, as a precondition to relief or exemption from such tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;
(k) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed with respect to payments on any Registered Security by reason of the failure of the
Holder to fulﬁll the statement requirement of Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code; or
(1) any Combination of items (a), (b), (C), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (i) and (k)-
In addition, the Company will not pay additional amounts to a beneficial owner of a Security that is a ﬁduciary, partnership, limited liability company or other
ﬁscally transparent entity, or to a beneﬁcial owner of a Security that is not the sole beneﬁcial owner of such Security, as the case may be. This exception, however,
will apply only to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with reSpect to the ﬁduciary, or a beneﬁcial owner or member of the partnership, limited liability company
or other ﬁscally transparent entity, would not have been entitled to the payment of an additional amount had the beneficiary, settlor, beneficial owner or member
received directly its beneficial or distributive share of the payment.
