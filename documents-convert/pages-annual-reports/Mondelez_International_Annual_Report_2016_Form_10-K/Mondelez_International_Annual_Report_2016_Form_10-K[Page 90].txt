On October 14, 2016, MIHN executed a $1.5 billion bank term loan facility. The loan facility consists of two $750 million loans, one with a three-year
maturity and the other with a ﬁve-year maturity. The term loans can be drawn at any time for 60 days after signing. On October 25, 2016, we gave
notice of our intent to fully draw on the loan with a five-year maturity, and funding occurred on October 28, 2016. Proceeds from the $750 million term
loan may be used for general corporate purposes, including funding of the tender offer or other debt. On October 25, 2016, we also gave notice of
our intent to terminate the $750 million loan with the three-year maturity.
On February 9, 2016, $1,750 million of our 4.125% US. dollar notes matured. The notes and accrued interest to date were paid with net proceeds
from the fr .400 million Swiss franc-denominated notes issued on January 26, 2016 and the 8 700 million euro-denominated notes issued on
January 21, 2016, as well as cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper. As we reﬁnanced $1,150 million of the matured notes with net
proceeds from the long-term debt issued in January 2016, we reﬂected this amount within long-term debt as of December 31, 2015.
On January 26, 2016, we issued fr .400 million of Swiss franc-denominated notes, or $399 million in US. dollars locked in with a fonNard currency

We received proceeds, net of premiums and deferred ﬁnancing costs, of $398 million that were used to partially fund the February 2016 note maturity
and for other general corporate purposes. We recorded approximately $1 million of premiums and deferred ﬁnancing costs, which will be amortized
into interest expense over the life of the notes.

approximately $372 million in US. dollars as of November 30, 2015, due in July 2018. We financed the repurchase of these notes, including the
payment of accrued interest and other costs incurred, from net proceeds received from the £400 million British pound sterling-denominated notes
issuance on November 25, 2015 described below. In connection with retiring this debt, during the three months ended December 31, 2015, we
recorded a $40 million loss on extinguishment of debt within interest expense related to the amount we paid to retire the debt in excess of its carrying
value and from recognizing unamortized premiums and deferred ﬁnancing costs in earnings at the time of the debt extinguishment. Cash costs
related to tendering the debt are included in long-term debt repayments in the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows for the year ended December 31,
