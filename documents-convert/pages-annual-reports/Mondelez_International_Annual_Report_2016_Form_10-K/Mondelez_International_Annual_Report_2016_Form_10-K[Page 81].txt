On March 31, 2016, we received a binding offer totaling 6 176 million ($185 million as of December 31, 2016) for the sale of several manufacturing
facilities in France and the sale or license of several local confectionery brands. Taking into account agreed upon sales price adjustments related to
cash, employee-related liabilities and working capital to be transferred at closing, we currently estimate a sales price of € 225 million ($237 million as
of December 31, 2016) based on net book values as of December 31, 2016. The ﬁnal sales price is subject to change as working capital and other
account balances may change at the time of closing. The transactions are subject to EU. and local regulatory approvals, completion of employee
consultation requirements and additional steps to prepare the assets for transfer. During the fourth quarter, we received the Works Council approval
and the buyer obtained anti-trust clearance in all markets where it was required. As of December 31, 2016, the held for sale assets and liabilities
consisted of $125 million of current assets, $174 million of non-current assets, $33 million of current liabilities and $29 million of non-current liabilities
based on the December 31, 2016 euro-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate. On March 31, 2016, we recorded a $14 million impairment charge for a gum &
candy trademark as a portion of its carrying value would not be recoverable based on future cash ﬂows expected under a planned license agreement
with the buyer. In May 2016, we recorded an additional $5 million impairment charge for another candy trademark to reduce the overall net assets to
the estimated net sales proceeds after transaction costs. Additionally, in 2016, we incurred and accrued $86 million of incremental expenses to ready
the business for the sale transactions expected to close in 2017. We recorded these costs within cost of sales and selling, general and administrative
expenses of our Europe segment.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also completed the following sale transactions:
o On December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of a chocolate factory in Belgium. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a
pre-tax loss of € 65 million ($68 million as of December 31, 2016), within asset impairment and exit costs in our Europe segment. The
loss includes a ﬁxed asset impairment charge of € 30 million ($31 million as of December 31, 2016), a loss on disposal of € 22 million
($23 million as of December 31, 2016) and incremental expenses we incurred and accrued of € 13 million ($14 million as of
December 31, 2016) related to selling the factory.

was $28 million and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $9 million within gains on divestiture within our Latin America segment. We divested

transaction, we incurred $2 million of transaction costs and accrued expenses.

recorded a pre-tax gain of $6 million ($5 million after-tax) within selling, general and administrative expenses of our Europe segment in
the year ended December 31, 2016. We divested $8 million of indeﬁnite-lived intangible assets and less than $1 million of other assets.
We received cash proceeds of € 12 million ($14 million as of May 2, 2016) upon closing and another 6 2 million ($2 million as of
October 31, 2016) of consideration following the completion of post-closing requirements. The additional $2 million of consideration
increased the pre-tax gain to $8 million ($6 million after-tax) through December 31, 2016.
On November 2, 2016, we purchased from Burton’s Biscuit Company certain intangibles, which include the license to manufacture, market and sell
Cadbury-branded biscuits in additional key markets around the world, including in the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, North America and Saudi
Arabia. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Total cash paid for the acquired assets was £199 million ($246 million as of
December 31, 2016). We are working to complete the valuation work and have recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $72 million to
deﬁnite-life intangible assets, $156 million to goodwill, $14 million to property, plant and equipment and $4 million to inventory as of December 31,
