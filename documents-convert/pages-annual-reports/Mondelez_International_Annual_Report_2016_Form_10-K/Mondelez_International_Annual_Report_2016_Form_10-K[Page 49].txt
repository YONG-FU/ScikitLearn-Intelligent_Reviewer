Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that cash from operations, our $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and our authorized long-term ﬁnancing will provide sufﬁcient liquidity for
our working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, future contractual obligations, share repurchases and payment of our anticipated quarterly
dividends. We continue to utilize our commercial paper program, international credit lines and long-term debt issuances for regular funding
requirements. We also use intercompany loans with our international subsidiaries to improve ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. Earnings outside of the United States
are considered indeﬁnitely reinvested and no material tax liability has been accrued as of December 31, 2016. Overall, we do not expect any
negative effects to our funding sources that would have a material effect on our liquidity, including the indefinite reinvestment of our earnings outside
of the United States.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities:
Operating activities provided net cash of $2,838 million in 2016, $3,728 million in 2015 and $3,562 million in 2014. Cash ﬂows from operating
activities were lower in 2016 than 2015 due to higher contributions to our pension beneﬁt plans in 2016 and higher working capital cash
improvements in 2015 than in 2016. Cash flows from operating activities in all years were favorably impacted by working capital improvements,
primarily due to continually decreasing our cash conversion cycle (a metric that measures working capital efﬁciency and utilizes days sales
outstanding, days inventory on hand and days payables outstanding) to negative 28 days in 2016, negative 12 days in 2015 and positive 10 days in
2014. Cash flows from operating activities were favorable in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily due to higher relative working capital cash improvements
than in 2014 and signiﬁcant tax payments in 2014 related to the $2.6 billion Starbucks arbitration award we received in late 2013, partially offset by
higher contributions to our pension beneﬁt plans in 2015.
Net Cash Provided b y/ (Used in) Investing Activities:
Net cash used in investing activities was $1,029 million in 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $2,649 million in 2015 and net cash
used in investing activities was $1,642 million in 2014. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 and the increase
in net cash provided by investing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 primarily relate to $4.7 billion of proceeds, net of divested cash and transaction
costs, from the contribution of our global coffee businesses, the divestiture of AGF and the cash receipt of $1 .0 billion due to the settlement of
currency exchange fon/vard contracts related to our coffee business transactions in 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2016
relative to 2015 is partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2016 of $290 million. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities in
2015 relative to 2014 is also driven by lower capital expenditures in 2015 of $128 million, partially offset by the $611 million reduction of cash due to
the Venezuela deconsolidation, $501 million of contributed JDE receivables and a $43 million cash payment to fund a capital increase in JDE and
$527 million of payments to acquire a biscuit operation in Vietnam and the Enjoy Life Foods snack food business in 2015.
Capital expenditures were $1,224 million in 2016, $1,514 million in 2015 and $1,642 million in 2014. We continue to make capital expenditures
primarily to modernize manufacturing facilities and support new product and productivity initiatives. We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be up to
$1.2 billion, including capital expenditures in connection with our 2014-2018 Restructuring Program. We expect to continue to fund these
expenditures from operations.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities:
Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities was $1,862 million in 2016, $5,883 million in 2015 and $2,688 million in 2014. The decrease in net cash used in
ﬁnancing activities in 2016 relative to 2015 was primarily due to higher net short-term debt issuances and $1.0 billion of lower share repurchases
following the exceptional year of share repurchases using proceeds from the global coffee business transactions in 2015. The increase in net cash
used in ﬁnancing activities in 2015 relative to 2014 was primarily due to higher repayments of long-term debt in 2015 (including the tender offers and
euro notes maturities), $1.9 billion of higher share repurchases and higher net short-term debt repayments, partially offset by higher proceeds
received from long-term note issuances.
Debt:
From time to time we refinance long-term and short-term debt. Refer to Note 7, Debt and Borrowing Arrangements , for details of our tender offers,
debt issuances and maturities during 2016, 2015 and 2014. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt and the proportionate
amount of each varies as a result of current and expected business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Due to seasonality, in the ﬁrst
and second quarters of the year, our working capital requirements grow, increasing the need for short-term ﬁnancing. The third and fourth quarters of
the year typically generate higher cash ﬂows. As such, we may issue commercial paper or secure other forms of ﬁnancing throughout the year to
meet short-term working capital needs.
