((1) Register . The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
delivered to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal and interest
amounts of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the “ R7egister,”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and Mondeléz, the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by Mondeléz, any
Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(e) Sale of Participation . Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and any Note or Notes held by it),
subject to the following:
(i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to Mondeléz hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) Mondeléz, the other Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
(iv) each participant shall be entitled to the beneﬁts of Sections 2.12 and 2.15 (subject to the limitations and requirements of those Sections,
including the requirements to provide forms and/or certificates pursuant to Section 2.15(e), (f) or (g)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section,
(v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or any
consent to any departure by any Borrower or Mondeléz therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal
of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Advances or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, and
(vi) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 2.12 and 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with Mondelez or
the relevant Borrower’s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
