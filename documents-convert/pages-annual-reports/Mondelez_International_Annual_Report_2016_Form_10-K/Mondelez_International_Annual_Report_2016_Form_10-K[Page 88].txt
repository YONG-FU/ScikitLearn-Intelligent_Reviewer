As of December 31, 2016, the commercial paper issued and outstanding had between 3 and 88 days remaining to maturity. Bank loans include
borrowings on primarily uncommitted credit lines maintained by some of our international subsidiaries to meet short-term working capital needs.
Borrowing Arrangements:
We maintain a $4.5 billion multi-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs, and to
support our commercial paper program. On October 14, 2016, the revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to expire on October 11, 2018,
was extended through October 11, 2021. The revolving credit agreement includes a covenant that we maintain a minimum shareholders’ equity of at
least $24.6 billion, excluding accumulated other comprehensive earnings / (losses) and the cumulative effects of any changes in accounting
principles. At December 31, 2016, we complied with this covenant as our shareholders’ equity, as deﬁned by the covenant, was $36.3 billion. The
revolving credit facility agreement also contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. There are no credit rating triggers,
provisions or other ﬁnancial covenants that could require us to post collateral as security. As of December 31, 2016, no amounts were drawn on the
facility.
Some of our international subsidiaries maintain primarily uncommitted credit lines to meet short-term working capital needs. Collectively, these credit
lines amounted to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2015. Borrowings on these lines amounted to $160 million at
December 31, 2016 and $236 million at December 31, 2015.
