(6) Includes our historical global coffee business prior to the July 2, 2015 divestiture. We reclassiﬁed the results of our historical coffee business from Adjusted
Operating Income and included them with equity method investment earnings in Adjusted EPS to facilitate comparisons of past and future coffee operating
results. Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions, and Non-GAAP Financial Measures appearing later in this section for more information.
(7) Historically, we have recorded income from equity method investments within our operating income as these investments operated as extensions of our base
business. Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, to align with the accounting for JDE earnings, we began to record the earnings from our equity method
investments in after-tax equity method investment earnings outside of operating income. In periods prior to July 2, 2015, we have reclassiﬁed the equity
method earnings from Adjusted Operating Income to evaluate our operating results on a consistent basis.
(8) Refer to Note 2, Divestitures and Acquisitions , for more information on the April 23, 2015 divestiture of AGF and the December 1, 2016 sale of a confectionery
business in Costa Rica. The divestiture of AGF generated a pre-tax gain of $13 million and after-tax loss of $9 million in 2015. The sale of the confectionery
business in Costa Rica generated a pre-tax and after-tax gain of $9 million in 2016.

During 2015, higher net pricing outpaced increased input costs. Higher net pricing, due to input-cost driven pricing actions taken during the year, was
reflected across all segments. The increase in input costs was driven by higher raw material costs, in part due to higher currency exchange
transaction costs on imported materials, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs. Unfavorable volume / mix was reﬂected across all segments.
Total selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $880 million from 2014, due to a number of factors noted in the table above, including
in part, a favorable currency impact, the adjustment for deconsolidating our historical coffee business, lower devaluation charges related to our net
monetary assets in Venezuela and the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring Program costs. The decreases were partially offset by increases from
higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program, costs associated with the coffee business transactions, lower value-added tax
(“VAT”)-related settlements, the reclassiﬁcation of equity method investment earnings, the impact of acquisitions and a gain on a sale of property in
2014.
Excluding the factors noted above, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $321 million from 2014. The increase was driven primarily
by higher advertising and consumer promotions support, particularly behind our Power Brands.
We recorded a beneﬁt of $30 million in 2015 from VAT-related settlements in Latin America as compared to $84 million in 2014. Unfavorable
currency impacts decreased operating income by $453 million, due primarily to the strength of the US. dollar relative to most currencies, including
the euro, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Russian ruble.
Excluding the portion related to deconsolidating our historical coffee business, the change in unrealized gains / (losses) increased operating income
by $129 million in 2015. In 2015, the net unrealized gains on currency and commodity hedging activity were $56 million ($96 million including coffee
related activity), as compared to net unrealized losses of $73 million ($112 million including coffee related activity) in 2014 related to currency and
commodity hedging activity.
Operating income margin increased from 9.5% in 2014 to 30.0% in 2015. The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by the pre-
tax gain on the coffee business transactions, an increase in our Adjusted Operating Income margin, the absence of 2012-2014 Restructuring
Program costs, the favorable year-over-year change in mark-to-market gains / losses from derivatives and lower devaluation charges related to our
net monetary assets in Venezuela. The items that increased operating income margin were partially offset by the loss on deconsolidation of
Venezuela, higher costs incurred for the 2014-2018 Restructuring Program and costs associated with the coffee business transactions. Adjusted
Operating Income margin increased from 12.0% in 2014 to 13.0% in 2015. The increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin was driven primarily
by improved gross margin, reflecting productivity efforts, and improved overhead leverage from cost reduction programs, partially offset by increased
advertising and consumer promotions support.
