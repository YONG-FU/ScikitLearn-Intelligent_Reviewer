At December 31, 2016 ﬁJture interest payments on automotive capital lease obligations were $371 million. GM Financial had no capital lease obligations
at December 31, 2016.
Compliance with Debt Covenants Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain ﬁnancial and
operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary ﬁnancial statements. Some of GM Financial’s secured
and unsecured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels.
Failure to meet certain of these requirements may result in a covenant violation or an event of default depending on the terms of the agreement. An event of
default may allow lenders to declare amounts outstanding under these agreements immediately due and payable, to enforce their interests against collateral
pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability or GM Financial's ability to obtain additional borrowings. No technical defaults or covenant violations
existed at December 31, 2016.
Note 14. Pensions and Other Postretirement Beneﬁts
Employee Pension and Other Postretirement Beneﬁt Plans
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Pension Plans Deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans covering eligible U.S. hourly employees (hired prior to October 2007) and Canadian hourly
employees (hired prior to October 2016) generally provide beneﬁts of negotiated, stated amounts for each year of service and supplemental beneﬁts for
employees who retire with 30 years of service before normal retirement age. The beneﬁts provided by the deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans covering eligible U.S.
(hired prior to January 1, 2001) and Canadian salaried employees and employees in certain other non-U.S. locations are generally based on years of service
and compensation history. Accrual of deﬁned pension beneﬁts ceased in 2012 for US. and Canadian salaried employees. There is also an unfunded
nonqualiﬁed pension plan covering primarily U.S. executives for service prior to January 1, 2007 and it is based on an “excess plan” for service after that
date.
The ﬁnding policy for qualiﬁed deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable laws and
regulations or to directly pay beneﬁt payments where appropriate. In the year ended December 31, 2016 all legal ﬁinding requirements were met;
additionally we made discretionary contributions to our US. hourly pension plan of $2.0 billion. These discretionary contributions were ﬁlnded with the net
proceeds from the issuance of the automotive senior unsecured notes described in Note 13. The following table summarizes contributions made to the deﬁned
beneﬁt pension plans:
Years Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
[ms hourly and salaried $ 2,054 $ 95 $ 143 l
Non-US. 1,033 _ 1,120 _ 770
lTotal $ 3,087 _$ 1,215 _$ 913 1
We expect to contribute $73 million to our US. non-qualiﬁed plans and $970 million to our non—U.S. pension plans in 2017.
