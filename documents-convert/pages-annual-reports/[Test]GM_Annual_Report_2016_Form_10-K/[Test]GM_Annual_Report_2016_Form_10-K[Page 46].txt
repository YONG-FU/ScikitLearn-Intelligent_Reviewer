GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
GM Financial primarily ﬁnances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used GM Financial may use
foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and lease assets to
minimize any impact to earnings.
GM Financial had foreign currency swaps in asset positions with notional amounts of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion and in liability positions with notional
amounts of $910 million and an insigniﬁcant amount at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The fair value of these derivative ﬁnancial instruments was
insigniﬁcant.
