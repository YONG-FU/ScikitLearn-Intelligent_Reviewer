Notes to The Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued
@) Sales and Sales-Related Taxes
The Company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and
concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction between the Company and its customers. These taxes mainly include
the consumption taxes of RMB 8,799,445,126, RMB 8,986,941,822 and RMB 9,450,509,601 for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(q) Research and development costs
Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for research activities relating to product
development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred. Such expenditures amounted to RMB 5,152,768,659,
RMB 3,771,754,277 and RMB 3,442,856,072 for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
(r) Government grants
The Company receives grants from the government mainly to support infrastructure construction and capital
expenditures. Such grants are deferred and are generally refundable to the extent the Company does not utilize the funds
for qualifying expenditures. Once earned, the Company records the grants as a contra amount to the assets and amortizes
such amount over the useful lives of the related assets as a reduction to depreciation expense. For grants received not
relating to infrastructure construction and capital expenditures, they are recorded as a reduction of expenses according to
the nature.
(5) Income taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
consolidated financial statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of
operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the
carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized.
