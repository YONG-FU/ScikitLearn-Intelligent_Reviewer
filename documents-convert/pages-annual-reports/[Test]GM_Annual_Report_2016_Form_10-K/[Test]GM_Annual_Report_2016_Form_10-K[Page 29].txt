Factors which most signiﬁcantly inﬂuence a region's proﬁtability are industry volume, market share, and the relative mix of vehicles (cars, trucks,
crossovers) sold. Variable proﬁt is a key indicator of product proﬁtability. Variable proﬁt is deﬁned as revenue less material cost, freight, the variable
component of manufacturing expense and warranty and recall-related costs. Vehicles with higher selling prices generally have higher variable proﬁt.
