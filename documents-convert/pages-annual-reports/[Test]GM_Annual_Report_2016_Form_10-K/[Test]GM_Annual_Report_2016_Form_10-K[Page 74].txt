NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset mixes will effectively ﬁnd the projected pension plan
liabilities, while aligning with the risk tolerance of the plans' ﬁduciaries. The strategic asset mixes for U.S. deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans are increasingly
designed to satisfy the competing objectives of improving funded positions (market value of assets equal to or greater than the present value of the liabilities)
and mitigating the possibility of a deterioration in funded status.
Derivatives may be used to provide cost effective solutions for rebalancing investment portfolios, increasing or decreasing exposure to various asset classes
and for mitigating risks, primarily interest rate and currency risks. Equity and ﬁxed income managers are permitted to utilize derivatives as efﬁcient
substitutes for traditional securities. Interest rate derivatives may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plan's targeted investment policy.
Alternative investment managers are permitted to employ leverage, including through the use of derivatives, which may alter economic exposure.
In December 2016 an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. The study resulted in new target asset allocations being approved
for the U.S. pension plans with resulting changes to the expected long-term rate of return on assets. The weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets
decreased from 6.3% at December 31, 2015 to 6.2% at December 31, 2016. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension
expense for non—U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.
Target Allocation Percentages The following table summarizes the target allocations by asset category for U.S. and non-U.S. deﬁned beneﬁt pension
plans:
