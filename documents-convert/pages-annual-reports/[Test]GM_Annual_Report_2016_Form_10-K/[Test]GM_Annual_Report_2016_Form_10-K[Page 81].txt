GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
In some instances certain assets of the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of certain guarantees.
Our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may also reduce the amount of certain guarantees. If vehicles are required to be
repurchased under vehicle repurchase obligations, the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer.
We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemniﬁcation provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our
maximum exposure under these indemniﬁcations or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Insigniﬁcant amounts have been recorded
for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insigniﬁcant.
Credit Cards Credit card programs offer rebates that can be applied primarily against the purchase or lease of our vehicles. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,
our redemption liability was insigniﬁcant, our deferred revenue was $286 million and $258 million, and qualiﬁed cardholders had rebates available, net of
deferred program revenue, of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. Our redemption liability and deferred revenue are recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other
liabilities.
