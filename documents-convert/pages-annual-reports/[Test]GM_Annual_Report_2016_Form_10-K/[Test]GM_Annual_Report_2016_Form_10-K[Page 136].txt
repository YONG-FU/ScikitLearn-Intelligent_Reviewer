Notes to The Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued
(1) Restricted reserves
Pursuant to laws applicable to entities incorporated in the PRC, the Company and its subsidiaries must make
apprOpriations from after-tax proﬁt to a surplus reserve fund, enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare fund. The
amount allocated to each of these funds is at the discretion of the Company's board of directors. For the year ended
December 31, 2016 and 2015, appropriation of 0.5%, 0.5% and 1% of after-tax proﬁt has been made to surplus reserve
fund, enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare fund, respectively (2014: 1% for each fund). The surplus reserve fund
can only be used to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses of the respective companies under PRC
regulations. The enterprise expansion fund was RMB 1,578,174,536 and RMB 1,479,953,772 as of December 31, 2016
and 2015 respectively, and the surplus reserve fund was RMB 1,587,500,609 and RMB 1,489,279,845 as of December
31, 2016 and 2015 respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company contributed
RMB 222,528,467, RMB 234,557,894 and RMB 206,506,851 to the staff welfare fund, all of which was recorded in
general and administrative expenses. In addition, due to the restrictions on the distribution of statutory capital from the
Company, statutory capital of RMB 8,802,006,138 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is considered restricted.
(a) Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and
cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company places cash and cash equivalents with ﬁnancial institutions with high credit ratings and quality.
The Company conducts credit evaluations of customers and generally does not require collateral or other security ﬁom
the customers. The Company has no signiﬁcant credit risk associated with accounts receivable.
(v) Recently issued accounting standards
In 2016 we adopted ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes", which is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classiﬁed as non-current. Deferred tax assets amounted to RMB 1,004,934,862 as
of December 31, 2015 were reclassiﬁed from current assets to non—current assets to conform to our current year
presentation.
In 2015 we adopted ASU 2015-02, "Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis", which is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-02 requires us to reassess
whether certain entities should be consolidated. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
