Note 11. Variable Interest Entities
GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPES) that are considered VIES to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-sponsored warehouse
facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIES is backed by ﬁnance receivables and leasing
related assets transferred by GM Financial to the VIES (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneﬁciary of the SPES because the
servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most signiﬁcantly impact the performance of the
VIES and the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially
be signiﬁcant. The assets serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have
recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM
Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required and does not currently intend to provide additional ﬁnancial support to these SPES. While
these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated ﬁnancial statements, they are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them
and are not available to GM Financial's creditors. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs:
December 31, 2016 _ December 31, 2015
lRestricted cash — current 35 1,532 $ 1,345 l

GM Financial short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt $ 20,005 $ 13,545
{GM Financial long-term debt $ 18,239 $ 15,841 l
GM Financial recognizes ﬁnance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued in a
securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize probable loan losses inherent in the ﬁnance receivables.
