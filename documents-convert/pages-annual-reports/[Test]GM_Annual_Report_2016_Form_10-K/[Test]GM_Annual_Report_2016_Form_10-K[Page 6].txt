GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
The sales and market share data provided in the table above includes both ﬂeet vehicle sales and sales to retail customers. Certain ﬂeet transactions,
particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less proﬁtable than sales to retail customers. Asigniﬁcant portion of the sales to daily rental car
companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase
obligations. The following table summarizes estimated ﬂeet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):

Product Pricing Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and ﬂeet incentives such as customer rebates and
ﬁnance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of
demand for our products. In 2017 we plan to continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering incentives as required. We believe this strategy,
coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen our brands.
