Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (PAW—GM). Wholesale volumes were used for Industry, GM and Market Share. Our retail sales in China were 3,871, 3,613 and 3,435 in
the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. In 2017, we will begin using vehicle registrations data as the basis for calculating industry volume and market share in
China on a prospective basis.
(C) We do not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly these countries are excluded from industry sales data and corresponding
calculation of market share.
In the year ended December 31, 2016 we estimate we had the largest market share in North America and South America, the number three market share in
the Asia/Paciﬁc, Middle East and Aﬁica region, which included the number two market share in China, and the number eight market share in Europe. In the
year ended December 31, 2016 the Asia/Paciﬁc, Middle East and Africa region was our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented 45.8% of
our global retail vehicle sales. Refer to the Overview in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)
for discussion on changes in market share by region.
