During the three months ended September 30, 2014 we began accruing the costs for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale in GMNA, which resulted
in a charge due to a change in estimate for previously sold vehicles of $874 million recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2014. We had historically
accrued estimated costs related to recall campaigns in GMNA when probable and reasonably estimable, which typically occurred once it was determined a
speciﬁc recall campaign was needed and announced. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued for recall campaigns to be an
insigniﬁcant amount at December 31, 2016.
