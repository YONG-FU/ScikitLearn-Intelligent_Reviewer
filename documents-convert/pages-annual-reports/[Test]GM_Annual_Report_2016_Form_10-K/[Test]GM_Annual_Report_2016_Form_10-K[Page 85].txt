Common Stock Holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our dividends declared per common
share were $1.52, $1.38 and $1.20 and our total dividends paid on common stock were $2.3 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote. The
liquidation rights of holders of our common stock are secondary to the payment or provision for payment of all our debts and liabilities and to holders of our
preferred stock, if any such shares are then outstanding.
In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we purchased 77 million and 102 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $2.5 billion and
$3.5 billion as part of the common stock repurchase program announced in March 2015, which our Board of Directors increased and extended in January
2016 and January 2017.
Warrants At December 31, 2015 the number of warrants outstanding was 70 million consisting of two tranches of warrants that we issued in July 2009. The
ﬁrst tranche expired on July 10, 2016. The second tranche is exercisable at any time prior to July 10, 2019 at an exercise price of $ 1 8.33 per share. We had 42
million of these warrants outstanding at December 31, 2016.
Series A Preferred Stock In December 2014 we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the
aggregate liquidation amount, including accumulated dividends, of $3.9 billion, which reduced Net income attributable to common stockholders by $809
million.
