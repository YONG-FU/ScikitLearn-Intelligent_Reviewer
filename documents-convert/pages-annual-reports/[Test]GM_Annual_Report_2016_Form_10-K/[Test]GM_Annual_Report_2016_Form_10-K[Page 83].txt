GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(a) At December 31, 2015 deferred tax assets related to certain sales incentives were reclassiﬁed from Miscellaneous to Warranties, dealer and customer allowances, claims and
discounts to conform to the current period presentation.
(b) At December 31, 2016 US. operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $8.7 billion expire by 2036 if not utilized and the remaining balance of $0.3 billion may be carried
forward indeﬁnitely.
(c) At December 31, 2016 Non-U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $1.3 billion expire by 2036 if not utilized and the remaining balance of $4.3 billion may be
carried forward indeﬁnitely.
Valuation Allowances At December 31, 2016 valuation allowances against deferred tax assets of $4.6 billion were comprised of cumulative losses and tax
credits, primarily in GME, South Korea and certain US. states.
At December 31, 2015 as a result of business restructuring and improving proﬁtability in certain European businesses evidenced by three years of adjusted
cumulative earnings and the completion of our near— and medium-term business plans in the three months ended December 31, 2015 that forecast continuing
improvement in proﬁtability, we determined that it was more likely than not that our future earnings will be sufﬁcient to realize the deferred tax assets in
these European businesses. Accordingly we reversed $3.9 billion of GME's valuation allowances resulting in an income tax beneﬁt.
Uncertain Tax Positions The following table summarizes activity of the total amounts of unrecognized tax beneﬁts:
Years Ended December 31,
2016 _ 2015 _ 2014
Beginning balance $ 1,385 $ 1,877 $ 2,530 l
Additions to current year tax positions 49 54 184
lAdditions to prior years' tax positions 97 115 149 l
Reductions to prior years' tax positions (193) (378) (603)
Reductions in tax positions due to lapse of statutory limitations (108) (201) (164) l
Settlements (1) (3) (13 8)
lOther (7) _ (79) _ (81)l
Ending balance r$ 1,222 r r$ 1,385 r $ 1,877 7
At December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were $712 million and $896 million of unrecognized tax beneﬁts that if recognized would favorably affect our
effective tax rate in the ﬁiture. In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 income tax related interest and penalties were insigniﬁcant. At
December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had liabilities of$ 172 million and $183 million for income tax related interest and penalties.
At December 31, 2016 it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts in the next twelve
months.
Other Matters Income tax returns are ﬁled in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have
open tax years from 2006 to 2016 with various signiﬁcant tax jurisdictions. Tax authorities may have the ability to review and adjust net operating loss or
tax credit carryforwards that were generated prior to these periods if utilized in an open tax year. These open years contain matters that could be subject to
differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the
sustainability of income tax credits for a given audit cycle. Given the global nature of our operations there is a risk that transfer pricing disputes may arise.
We have net operating loss carryforwards in Germany through November 30, 2009 that, as a result of reorganizations that took place in 2008 and 2009,
were not recorded as deferred tax assets. Depending on the outcome of pending European court decisions these loss carryforwards may be available to reduce
ﬁlture taxable income in Germany.
Note 17. Restructuring and Other Initiatives
We have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we plan to execute additional initiatives in the ﬁiture, if necessary, to align manufacturing
capacity and other costs with prevailing global automotive production and to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these programs
involve voluntary separations, no liabilities are generally recorded until offers to employees are accepted. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a
liability is generally recorded at the communication date.
