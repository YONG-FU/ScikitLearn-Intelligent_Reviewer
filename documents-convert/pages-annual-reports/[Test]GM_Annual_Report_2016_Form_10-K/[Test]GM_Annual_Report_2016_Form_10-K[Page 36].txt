We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional ﬂexibility in managing our global liquidity. The total size of our credit facilities was $14.6
billion and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. We did not have any
borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of $0.6 billion at December 31, 2016. GM Financial had
access to our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 but did not borrow against them. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements for additional information on credit facilities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.5 billion and
$0.4 billion, which consisted primarily of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. The following
