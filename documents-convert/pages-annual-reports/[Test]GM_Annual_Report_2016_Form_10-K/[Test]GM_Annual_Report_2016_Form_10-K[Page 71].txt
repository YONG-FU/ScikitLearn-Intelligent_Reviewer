GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Based on our current assumptions, over the next ﬁve years we expect no signiﬁcant mandatory contributions to our US. qualiﬁed pension plans and
mandatory contributions totaling $1.8 billion to our Canada and UK. pension plans.
Other Postretirement Beneﬁt Plans Certain hourly and salaried deﬁned beneﬁt plans provide postretirement medical, dental, legal service and life
insurance to eligible US. and Canadian retirees and their eligible dependents. Certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries have postretirement beneﬁt plans, although
most non-U.S. employees are covered by government sponsored or administered programs. We made contributions to the US. OPEB plans of $335 million,
$340 million and $354 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Plan participants' contributions were insigniﬁcant in the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Deﬁned Contribution Plans We have deﬁned contribution plans for eligible U.S. salaried and hourly employees that provide discretionary matching
contributions. Contributions are also made to certain non—U.S. deﬁned contribution plans. We made contributions to our deﬁned contribution plans of $594
million, $535 million and $513 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Signiﬁcant Plan Amendments, Beneﬁt Modiﬁcations and Related Events
Other Remeasurements We incorporated the mortality improvement tables issued by the Society of Actuaries (SOA) in the three months ended December
31, 2016 that lowered life expectancies and thereby indicated the amount of estimated aggregate beneﬁt payments to our US. pension plans' participants was
decreasing. This change in assumption decreased the December 31, 2016 US. pension and OPEB plans’ obligations by $888 million. In the three months
ended December 31, 2014 the SOAissued new mortality and mortality improvement tables that raised life expectancies and thereby indicated the amount of
estimated aggregate beneﬁt payments to our US. pension plans' participants was increasing. We incorporated these SOA mortality and mortality
improvement tables into our December 31, 2014 measurement of our US. pension and OPEB plans' beneﬁt obligations. The change in these assumptions
increased the December 31, 2014 US. pension and OPEB plans' obligations by $2.2 billion.
