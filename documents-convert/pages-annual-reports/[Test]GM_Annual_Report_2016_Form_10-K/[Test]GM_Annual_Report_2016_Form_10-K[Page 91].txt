Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁned in Rules
13a—15(e) or 15 d-15 (e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or
15d-15, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting as deﬁned in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance with US. GAAP.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Our management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting at December 31, 2016, utilizing the criteria
discussed in the “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
objective of this assessment was to determine whether our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective at December 31, 2016. Based on
management's assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective at December 31, 2016.
The effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting ﬁrm, as stated in its report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been any changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the three
months ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
