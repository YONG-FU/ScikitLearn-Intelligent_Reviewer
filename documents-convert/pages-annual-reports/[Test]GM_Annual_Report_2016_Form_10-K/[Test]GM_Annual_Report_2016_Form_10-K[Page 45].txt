prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging strategies to lock in the
interest rate spread.
Fixed interest rate receivables purchased by GM Financial may be pledged to secure borrowings under its credit facilities. Amounts borrowed under these
credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reﬂect prevailing market interest rates. To protect the interest rate
spread within each credit facility, GM Financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under its
credit facilities.
In GM Financial's securitization transactions it can transfer ﬁxed rate ﬁnance receivables to securitization trusts that, in turn, sell either ﬁxed rate or
ﬂoating rate securities to investors. Derivative ﬁnancial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on
the ﬂoating rate transactions.
GM Financial had interest rate swaps and caps in asset positions with notional amounts of $22.7 billion and $10.4 billion and in liability positions with
notional amounts of $29.5 billion and $13.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The fair value of these derivative ﬁnancial instruments in asset
positions was insigniﬁcant and in liability positions was $341 million and insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

The impact of GM Financial's discount rate, prepayment and credit loss assumptions is consistent with assumptions applied to interest rate sensitive assets
and liabilities reported at December 31, 2015. GM Financial estimates the realization of ﬁnance receivables in future periods using discount rate, prepayment
and credit loss assumptions similar to its historical experience. Credit facilities and securitization notes payable amounts have been classiﬁed based on
expected payoff. Senior notes principal amounts have been classiﬁed based on maturity.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain
international operations into US. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility
in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's ﬁnancial condition.
