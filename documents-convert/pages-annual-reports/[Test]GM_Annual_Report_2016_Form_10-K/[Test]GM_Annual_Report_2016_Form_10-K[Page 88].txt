GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Substantially all of the cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through
distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for
consumer retail sales, cars, trucks and crossovers are also sold to ﬂeet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial ﬂeet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with ﬂeet customers. Retail and ﬂeet customers
can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle
accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet and GMC brands. The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed
under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel and Vauxhall brands. We also have equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities
through various regional subsidiaries, primarily in Asia. These entities design, manufacture and/or market vehicles under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands.
Our automotive operations' interest income and interest expense, Maven, corporate expenditures including autonomous vehicle-related engineering and
other costs and certain nonsegment speciﬁc revenues and expenses are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash
