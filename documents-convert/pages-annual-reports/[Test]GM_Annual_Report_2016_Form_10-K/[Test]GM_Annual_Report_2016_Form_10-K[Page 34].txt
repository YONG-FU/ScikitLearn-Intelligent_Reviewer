Venezuelan Operations Our operations in Venezuela, which remain consolidated, continue to be negatively impacted by economic recession and political
instability in the country. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 we recorded devaluation and asset impairment charges of $0.7 billion and
$0.4 billion in Automotive cost of sales related to our inability to transact at the SICAD rate to obtain U.S. Dollars and the market restrictions imposed by the
Venezuelan government. We monitor the environment in Venezuela closely to assess whether changes evolve such that we no longer maintain a controlling
ﬁnancial interest. Absent ongoing vehicle production, our Venezuelan subsidiaries may require additional ﬁnancial support. At this time no decision has
been made Whether we will provide ﬁlrther ﬁnancial support if required. If a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain control, we may
incur a charge based on exchange rates at December 31, 2016 of up to $0.1 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving
credit facilities will be sufﬁcient to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through
total available liquidity and cash ﬂows generated from operations. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities
from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. Our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions
and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain an investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return excess cash to
stockholders. Our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately $9 billion annually
as well as payments for engineering and pro duct development activities; (2) payments
