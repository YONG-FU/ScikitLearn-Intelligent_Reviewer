Commercial Finance Receivables GM Financial's commercial ﬁnance receivables consist of dealer ﬁnancings, primarily for inventory purchases. A
proprietary model is used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. Acredit review of each dealer is performed at least annually, and if necessary, the dealer's risk
rating is adjusted on the basis of the review. Dealers in Group VI are subject to additional restrictions on funding, up to suspension of lines of credit and
liquidation of assets. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the commercial ﬁnance receivables on non-accrual status were insigniﬁcant. The following table
summarizes the credit risk proﬁle by dealer grouping of the commercial ﬁnance receivables:
