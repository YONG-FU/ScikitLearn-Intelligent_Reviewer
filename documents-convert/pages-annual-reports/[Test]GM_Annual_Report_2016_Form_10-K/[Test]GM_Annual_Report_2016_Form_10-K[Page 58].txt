NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Automotive We utilize options, swaps and forward contracts to manage foreign currency and commodity price risks. The change in fair value of option and
forward contracts not designated as hedges is recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. Cash ﬂows for all derivative ﬁnancial
instruments are classiﬁed in cash ﬂows from operating activities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 we had derivative instruments not designated as hedges in
asset positions with notional amounts of $5.7 billion and $6.8 billion and in liability positions with notional amounts of $651 million and $264 million. The
fair value of these derivative instruments was insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Certain foreign currency and commodity forward contracts have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges. The risk being hedged is the foreign currency and
commodity price risk related to forecasted transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash ﬂow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of the cash ﬂow hedge is deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in Automotive cost of sales when the hedged item affects
earnings. Any ineffective portion is recorded in Automotive cost of sales in the period of remeasurement. At December 31, 2016 the notional amount of these
derivative instruments in asset positions was $909 million and was insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2015. The fair value of these derivative instruments was
insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial utilizes interest rate option and swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and foreign currency
swap agreements to manage foreign currency risk. The change in fair value of the option and swap agreements not designated as hedges is recorded in GM
Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Cash ﬂows for all derivative ﬁnancial instruments are classiﬁed in cash ﬂows from operating activities. At
December 31, 2016 and 2015 GM Financial had derivative instruments not designated as hedges in asset positions with notional amounts of $20.7 billion
and $11.9 billion and liability positions with notional amounts of $20.6 billion and $13.9 billion. The fair value of these derivatives was insigniﬁcant at
December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Certain interest rate swap agreements have been designated as fair value hedges of ﬁxed-rate debt. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the notional amounts of
these instruments in liability positions were $7.7 billion and $1.0 billion. The fair value of these derivative instruments in liability positions was $276
million at December 31, 2016 and was insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2015. The risk being hedged is the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. If the swap has been designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
are recorded in Interest expense. The change in fair value of the related derivative (excluding accrued interest) is also recorded in Interest expense.
Beginning in 2016 certain interest rate swap and foreign currency swap agreements have been designated as cash ﬂow hedges. At December 31, 2016 the
notional amount of these designated instruments in asset positions was $3.5 billion and in liability positions was $2.1 billion. The fair value of these
derivative instruments was insigniﬁcant at December 31, 2016. The risk being hedged is the foreign currency and interest rate risk related to forecasted
transactions. If the contract has been designated as a cash ﬂow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the cash ﬂow hedge is deferred in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is recognized in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses when the hedged item affects earnings. Any
ineffective portion is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses in the period of remeasurement.
The gains or losses on all derivative instruments included in the consolidated income statements and Accumulated other comprehensive loss were
insigniﬁcant in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Effective January 1, 2016 we retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, "Balance
Sheet Classiﬁcation of Deferred Taxes", which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classiﬁed as non-current. As a result current Deferred
income taxes and Accrued liabilities decreased by $8.6 billion and $249 million and non-current Deferred income taxes increased by $8.4 billion at
December 31, 2015 in our consolidated balance sheets.
In November 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash" (ASU
2016-18), which clariﬁes the presentation of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statements of cash ﬂows. Under ASU 2016-18 restricted
cash and restricted cash equivalents are included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of—period and end-of—period total amounts
shown on the statements of cash ﬂows. We adopted ASU 2016-18 during the three months ended December 31, 2016 on a retrospective basis. As a result Net
cash provided by operating activities decreased by $287 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased by an insigniﬁcant amount in the year
ended December 31, 2014. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $325 million and $339 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014
and beginning-of—period cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
