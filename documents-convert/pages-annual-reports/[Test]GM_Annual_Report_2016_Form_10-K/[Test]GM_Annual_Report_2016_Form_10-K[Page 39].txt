Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize off-balance sheet securitization arrangements. All trade or ﬁnance receivables and related
obligations subject to securitization programs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Note 15 of our
consolidated ﬁnancial statements for detailed information related to guarantees we have provided and for our noncancelable operating lease obligations.
Contractual Obligations and Other Long-Term Liabilities We have minimum commitments under contractual obligations, including purchase obligations.
Apurchase obligation is deﬁned as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that speciﬁes all signiﬁcant
terms, including ﬁxed or minimum quantities to be purchased or ﬁxed minimum price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Based on
these deﬁnitions, the following table includes only those contracts which include ﬁxed or minimum obligations. The majority of our purchases are not
included in the table as they are made under purchase orders which are requirements based and accordingly do not specify minimum quantities. The
following table summarizes aggregated information about our outstanding contractual obligations and other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2016:
