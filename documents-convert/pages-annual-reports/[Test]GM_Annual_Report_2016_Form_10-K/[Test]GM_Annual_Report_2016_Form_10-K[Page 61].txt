lFairvalue of GM Financial receivables $ 42,739 $ 36,707 l
GM Financial estimates the fair value of retail ﬁnance receivables using observable and unobservable Level 3 inputs within a cash ﬂow model. The inputs
reﬂect assumptions regarding expected prepayments, deferrals, delinquencies, recoveries and charge-offs of the loans within the portfolio. The cash ﬂow
model produces an estimated amortization schedule of the ﬁnance receivables. The projected cash ﬂows are then discounted using current risk-adjusted rates
to derive the fair value of the portfolio. Macroeconomic factors could affect the credit performance of the portfolio and therefore could potentially affect the
assumptions used in GM Financial's cash ﬂow model. A substantial majority of GM Financial's commercial ﬁnance receivables have variable interest rates
and maturities of one year or less. Therefore, the carrying amount, a level 2 input, is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Retail Finance Receivables GM Financial uses proprietary scoring systems in its underwriting process that measure the credit quality of retail ﬁnance
receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g. FICO scores or its equivalent) and contract
characteristics. In addition to GM Financial's proprietary scoring systems GM Financial considers other individual consumer factors such as employment
history, ﬁnancial stability and capacity to pay. Subsequent to origination GM Financial reviews the credit quality of retail ﬁnance receivables based on
customer payment activity. In North America, while we historically focused on consumers with lower than prime credit scores, we have expanded our prime
lending programs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, 48% and 60% of the retail ﬁnance receivables in North America were from consumers with sub-prime
credit scores, which are deﬁned as FICO scores or its equivalent of less than 620 at the time of loan origination. At the time of loan origination, substantially
all of GM Financial's international consumers have the equivalent of prime credit scores.
GM Financial purchases retail ﬁnance contracts from automobile dealers without recourse, and accordingly, the dealer has no liability to GM Financial if
the consumer defaults on the contract. Finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and GM Financial has the right to repossess the vehicle in the
event the consumer defaults on the payment terms of the contract.
An account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually
due. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the accrual of ﬁnance charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail ﬁnance receivables with contractual
amounts due of $807 million and $778 million. The following table
