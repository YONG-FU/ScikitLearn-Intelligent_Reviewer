Note 7. Equity in Net Assets of Nonconsolidated Afﬁliates
Nonconsolidated afﬁliates are entities in which an equity ownership interest is maintained and for which the equity method of accounting is used due to
our ability to exert signiﬁcant inﬂuence over decisions relating to their operating and ﬁnancial aﬁ‘airs. Revenue and expenses of our joint ventures are not
consolidated into our ﬁnancial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings of each joint venture is reﬂected as Equity income.
