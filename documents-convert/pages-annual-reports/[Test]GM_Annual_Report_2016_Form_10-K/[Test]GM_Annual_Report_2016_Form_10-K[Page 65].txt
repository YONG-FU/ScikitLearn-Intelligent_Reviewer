Note 9. Acquisition of Business
On May 12, 2016 we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Cruise, an autonomous vehicle technology company, to ﬁlrther accelerate our
development of autonomous vehicles. The deal consideration at closing was $581 million, of which $291 million was paid in cash and approximately $290
million was paid through the issuance of new common stock. The fair value of the common stock issued was determined based on the closing price of our
common stock on May 12, 2016. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into other agreements that will result in ﬁlture costs contingent upon the
continued employment of key individuals and additional performance-based awards contingent upon the achievement of speciﬁc technology and
commercialization milestones.
