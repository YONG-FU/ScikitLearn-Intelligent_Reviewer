The fair value of automotive debt measured utilizing Level 1 inputs was based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that a market
participant can access at the measurement date. The fair value of automotive debt measured utilizing Level 2 inputs was based on a discounted cash ﬂow
model using observable inputs. This model utilizes observable inputs such as contractual repayment terms and benchmark yield curves, plus a spread based
on our senior unsecured notes that is intended to represent our nonperformance risk. We obtain the benchmark yield curves and yields on unsecured notes
from independent sources that are widely used in the ﬁnancial industry. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the fair value of automotive debt
exceeded its carrying amount due primarily to a decrease in bond yields compared to yields at the time of issuance.
In February 2016 we issued $2.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprising $1.25 billion of 6.60% notes due in 2036 and
$750 million of 6.75% notes due in 2046. These notes contain terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the
amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to fund discretionary
contributions to our US. hourly pension plan as described in Note 14.
In May 2016 we amended and restated our two primary revolving credit facilities, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from $12.5 billion to $14.5
billion. These facilities consist of a three-year, $4.0 billion facility and a ﬁve-year, $10.5 billion facility. Both facilities are available to us as well as certain
wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. The three-year, $4.0 billion facility allows for borrowings in US. Dollars and other currencies and
includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of $1.0 billion and a letter of credit sub-facility of $1.0 billion. The five-year, $10.5 billion facility allows for
borrowings in US. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of $3.0 billion and a letter of credit sub-limit of $500
million.
The revolving credit facilities require us to maintain at least $4.0 billion in global liquidity and at least $2.0 billion in US. liquidity. If we fail to maintain
an investment grade corporate rating from at least two of the following credit rating agencies: Fitch, Moody's and S&P, certain subsidiaries of ours will be
required to provide guarantees under the terms of the revolving credit facilities. Interest rates on obligations under the revolving credit facilities are based on
prevailing annual interest rates for Eurodollar loans or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin.
In the years ended December 2015 and 2014 we prepaid and retired debt obligations with a total carrying amount of $538 million and $325 million which
primarily represented unsecured debt in Brazil and recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $449 million and $202 million.
