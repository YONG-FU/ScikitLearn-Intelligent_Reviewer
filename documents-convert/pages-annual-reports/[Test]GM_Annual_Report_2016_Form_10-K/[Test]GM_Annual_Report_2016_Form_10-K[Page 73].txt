Ezﬁe::uMMent charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015 were due primarily to the GM Canada hourly pension plan that was remeasured as a result of a
voluntary separation program.
(b) As a result of ceasing the accrual of additional beneﬁts for salaried plan participants, the rate of compensation increase does not have a signiﬁcant effect on our US pension
and OPEB plans.
Effective January 2016 the discount rate used to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and OPEB plans was based on individual
annual yield curve rates. This reﬁnement was considered a change in estimate and applied prospectively. The use of the individual annual yield curve rates
has reduced the service cost and interest cost by $768 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, which was offset in the actuarial gains and losses upon
the December 31, 2016 remeasurement of the plans' obligations.
U.S. pension plan service cost includes administrative expenses and Pension Beneﬁt Guarantee Corporation premiums which were insigniﬁcant in the
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net expense are determined at the beginning of the period
and updated for remeasurements. Non-US. pension plan administrative expenses included in service cost were insigniﬁcant in the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014.
Estimated amounts to be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic beneﬁt cost in the year ending December 31, 2017 based
on December 31, 2016 plan measurements are $261 million, consisting primarily of amortization of the net actuarial loss in the non-US. pension plans.
Assumptions
Investment Strategies and Long-Term Rate of Return Detailed periodic studies are conducted by our internal asset management group as well as outside
actuaries and are used to determine the long-term strategic mix among asset classes, risk mitigation strategies and the expected long-term return on asset
assumptions for the US. pension plans. The US. study includes a review of alternative asset allocation and risk mitigation strategies, anticipated ﬁiture long-
term performance and risk of the individual asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. Similar studies are performed for the signiﬁcant non—US. pension
plans with the assistance of outside actuaries and asset managers. While the studies incorporate data from recent plan performance and historical returns, the
expected long-term return on plan asset assumptions are determined based on long-term prospective rates of return.
We continue to pursue various options to ﬁmd and derisk our pension plans, including continued changes to the pension asset portfolio mix to reduce
ﬁlnded status volatility. The strategic asset mix and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored speciﬁcally for each plan. Individual plans have
distinct liabilities, liquidity needs and regulatory requirements. Consequently there are different investment policies set by individual plan ﬁduciaries.
Although investment policies and risk mitigation strategies may diﬁ‘er among plans, each investment strategy is considered to be appropriate in the context
of the speciﬁc factors affecting each plan.
