Note 21. Stock Incentive Plans
We grant to certain employees RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and stock options (collectively, stock incentive awards) under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2014
Long-Term Incentive Plan and, prior to our 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, RSUs under our 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Shares awarded under the plans
are subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves the company for reasons other than those permitted under the plans such as retirement, death or disability.
RSU awards granted either cliff vest or ratably vest generally over a three-year service period, as deﬁned in the terms of each award. PSU awards vest at the
end of a three-year performance period, based on performance criteria determined by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the
time of award. The number of shares earned may equal, exceed or be less than the targeted number of shares depending on whether the performance criteria
are met, surpassed or not met. Stock options granted expire 10 years from the grant date, with two-ﬁfths of the award becoming exercisable approximately 19
months after the date of grant and the remainder vest ratably over the next three years based on the performance of our common stock relative to that of a
speciﬁed peer group.
In connection with our acquisition described in Note 9, RSAs and PSUs were granted. The RSAs vest ratably, generally over a three-year service period.
The PSUs are contingent upon achievement of speciﬁc technology and commercialization milestones.
