Alternative Investment Strategies Investment funds include hedge ﬁinds, ﬁinds of hedge ﬁinds, equity funds and ﬁxed income ﬁinds. Hedge funds and
ﬁnds of hedge ﬁlnds managers typically seek to achieve their objectives by allocating capital across a broad array of funds and/or investment managers.
Equity funds invest in US. common and preferred stocks as well as similar equity securities issued by companies incorporated, listed or domiciled in
developed and/or emerging market countries. Fixed income funds include investments in high quality funds and, to a lesser extent, high yield funds. High
quality ﬁxed income ﬁinds invest in government securities, investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgage and asset-backed securities. High yield ﬁxed
income ﬁinds invest in high yield ﬁxed income securities issued by corporations which are rated below investment grade. Other investment funds also
included in this category primarily represent multi-strategy ﬁnds that invest in broadly diversiﬁed portfolios of equity, ﬁxed income and derivative
instruments.
Private equity and debt investments primarily consist of investments in private equity and debt funds. These investments provide exposure to and beneﬁt
from long-term equity investments in private companies, including leveraged buy-outs, venture capital and distressed debt strategies.
Real estate investments include ﬁnds that invest in entities which are primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition, development, ﬁnancing, sale and/ or
management of income-producing real estate properties, both commercial and residential. These funds typically seek long-term growth of capital and current
income that is above average relative to public equity funds.
Significant Concentrations of Risk The assets of the pension plans include certain investment ﬁinds, private equity and debt investments and real estate
investments. Investment managers may be unable to quickly sell or redeem some or all of these investments at an amount close or equal to fair value in order
to meet a plan's liquidity requirements or to respond to speciﬁc events such as deterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer or counterparty.
Illiquid investments held by the plans are generally long-term investments that complement the long-term nature of pension obligations and are not used
to fund beneﬁt payments when currently due. Plan management monitors liquidity risk on an ongoing basis and has procedures in place that are designed to
maintain ﬂexibility in addressing plan-speciﬁc, broader industry and market liquidity events.
The pension plans may invest in ﬁnancial instruments denominated in foreign currencies and may be exposed to risks that the foreign currency exchange
rates might change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of the foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Forward currency contracts
may be used to manage and mitigate foreign currency risk.
