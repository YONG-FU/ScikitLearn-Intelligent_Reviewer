Note 23. Segment Reporting
We analyze the results of our business through the following segments: GMNA, GME, GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial. The chief operating decision
maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments through earnings before interest and income taxes-adjusted, which is
presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision maker evaluates GM Financial through earnings before income taxes-adjusted because
interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and ﬁnancial performance of the segment.
Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategies. Our automotive manufacturing operations are integrated within the segments, beneﬁt
from broad-based trade agreements and are subject to regulatory requirements. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually proﬁtable on a fully
allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more proﬁtable vehicles and contribute
towards meeting required ﬁiel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle
basis.
