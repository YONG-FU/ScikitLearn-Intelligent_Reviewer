Notes to The Consolidated Financial Statements
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued
(w) Accounting Standards N at YetAdopted
In May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with
Customers" (ASU 2014-09), which requires us to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when
we have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service and requires expanded disclosures. ASU
2014-09, as amended, is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 will affect the amount and timing of
certain revenue related transactions primarily resulting ﬁom the earlier recognition of certain sales incentives. Upon
adoption of ASU 2014-09 sales incentives will be recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or
announcement. We continue to assess the overall impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated
ﬁnancial statements. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to be material to our consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. We have not yet determined whether we will adopt the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on a retrospective basis
or through a cumulative adjustments to equity.
In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases", which requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the
balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classiﬁed as
operating leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective beginning after January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. While we are
currently assessing the impact the adoption will have on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, we expect the primary
impact to our consolidated ﬁnancial position upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our
minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on our consolidated balance sheets resulting in the
recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under noncancelable operating
leases are disclosed in Note 9.
