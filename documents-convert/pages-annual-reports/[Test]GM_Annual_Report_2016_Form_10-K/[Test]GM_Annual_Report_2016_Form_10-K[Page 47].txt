REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
General Motors Company, its Directors, and Stockholders:
We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of General Motors Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016
and 2015, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016. We also have audited the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
management is responsible for these ﬁnancial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these ﬁnancial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the ﬁnancial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall ﬁnancial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal ﬁnancial ofﬁcers, or persons performing similar ﬁmctions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Acompany’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the ﬁnancial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over ﬁnancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of General Motors
Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
