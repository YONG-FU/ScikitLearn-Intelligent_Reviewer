inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue is recorded in the period in which the
program is announced. If the actual number of affected vehicles differs from this estimate, or if a different mix of incentives is actually paid, the reduction in
Automotive net sales and revenue due to incentives could be aﬁ‘ected. There are a multitude of inputs affecting the calculation of the estimate for sales
incentives and an increase or decrease in any of these variables could have a signiﬁcant effect on recorded sales incentives.

“continue,” “could,” “designed,” “effect,” “estimate,” “evaluate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “goal,” “initiative,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,”
“potential,” “priorities,” “project,” “pursue,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “when,” “will,” “would,” or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions
to identify forward-looking statements that represent our current judgment about possible future events. In making these statements we rely on assumptions
and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we
consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or ﬁnancial
results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative. These factors, which may be revised or
supplemented in subsequent reports on SEC Forms 10-Q and 8-K, include among others the following: (1) our ability to deliver new products, services and
customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry; (2) our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that
are able to attract a sufﬁcient number of consumers; (3) the success of our lull—size pick-up trucks and SUVs, which may be affected by increases in the price
of oil; (4) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (5) aggressive competition in China; (6) the international scale and footprint of our
operations which exposes us to a variety of domestic and foreign political, economic and regulatory risks, including the risk of changes in existing, the
adoption of new, or the introduction of novel interpretations of, laws regulations, policies or other activities of governments, agencies and similar
organizations particularly laws, regulations and policies relating to free trade agreements, vehicle safety including recalls, and, including such actions that
may affect the production, licensing, distribution or sale of our products, the cost thereof or applicable tax rates; (7) our joint ventures, which we cannot
operate solely for our beneﬁt and over which we may have limited control; (8) our ability to comply with extensive laws and regulations applicable to our
industry, including those regarding fuel economy and emissions; (9) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations including the
potential imposition of damages, substantial ﬁnes, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modiﬁcation of business practices,
equitable remedies and other sanctions against us in connection with various legal proceedings and investigations relating to our various recalls; (10) our
ability to comply with the terms of the DPA; (11) our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls and the cost and
effect on our reputation and products; (12) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow
us to meet production schedules; (13) our dependence on our manufacturing facilities around the world; (14) our highly competitive industry, which is
characterized by excess manufacturing capacity and the use of incentives and the introduction of new and improved vehicle models by our competitors; (15)
our ability to realize production eﬁiciencies and to achieve reductions in costs as we implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our
automotive operations; (16) our ability to successfully restructure our operations in various countries; (17) our ability to manage risks related to security
breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems; (18) our continued ability to develop captive ﬁnancing
capability through GM Financial; (19) signiﬁcant increases in our pension expense or projected pension contributions resulting from changes in the value of
plan assets, the discount rate applied to value the pension liabilities or mortality or other assumption changes; and (20) signiﬁcant changes in economic,
political, regulatory environment, market conditions, foreign currency exchange rates or political stability in the countries in which we operate, particularly
China, with the effect of competition from new market entrants and in the United Kingdom with passage of a referendum to discontinue membership in the
European Union.
We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors that aﬁ‘ect the subject of these statements, except where we
are expressly required to do so by law.
