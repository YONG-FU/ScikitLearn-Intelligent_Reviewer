NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which
requires us to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control rather than when we have transferred substantially all risks and rewards of a good or service
and requires expanded disclosures. ASU 2014-09, as amended, is eﬁ‘ective for us beginning January 1, 2018. ASU 2014-09 will affect the amount and timing
of certain revenue related transactions primarily resulting from the earlier recognition of certain sales incentives and ﬁxed fee license arrangements. Upon
adoption of ASU 2014-09 sales incentives will be recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or announcement and ﬁxed fee license
arrangements will be recognized when the customer is granted access to intellectual property instead of over the contract period. Certain transactions with
daily rental car companies may also qualify to be accounted for as a sale as opposed to the current accounting as an operating lease. We have not yet
determined whether we will adopt the provisions of ASU 2014-09 on a retrospective basis or through a cumulative adjustment to equity. We do not expect
the adoption ofASU 2014-09 to be material to our consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We continue to assess the overall impact the adoption ofASU 2014-09
will have on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and anticipate testing our new controls and processes designed to comply with ASU 2014-09 throughout
2017 to permit adoption by January 1, 2018.
In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (ASU 2016-01), which
requires, among other items, equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes
recognized in net income and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2018. At
December 31, 2016 the carrying value of equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting totaled $526 million and
unrealized gains or losses were insigniﬁcant. Currently we do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our consolidated
ﬁnancial statements, however changes in future market conditions and equity investment balances prior to the implementation date will affect the impact the
adoption may have on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" (ASU 2016-02), which requires us as the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet
thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classiﬁed as operating leases. The accounting for leases where we
are the lessor remains largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for us beginning January 1, 2019 with early adoption permitted. While we are currently
assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements, we expect the primary impact to our consolidated ﬁnancial position
upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted basis, of our minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases on our consolidated
balance sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations. Our current minimum commitments under noncancelable operating
leases are disclosed in Note 15.
In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments"
(ASU 2016-13), that requires entities to use a new impairment model based on expected losses. Under this new model an entity would recognize an
impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of credit losses on ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us beginning
January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted January 1, 2019. Credit losses under the new model will consider relevant information about past events,
current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, resulting in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses by GM Financial upon loan
origination as compared to our current accounting that recognizes credit losses as incurred. We are currently evaluating new processes to calculate credit
losses in accordance with ASU 2016-13 that, once completed, will determine the impact on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements which at the date of
adoption will increase the allowance for credit losses with a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings.
