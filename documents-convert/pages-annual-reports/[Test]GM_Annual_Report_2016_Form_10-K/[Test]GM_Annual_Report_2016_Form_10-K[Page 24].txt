(c) These adjustments primarily consist of the tax beneﬁt related to the valuation allowance reversal in Europe. The adjustment was excluded because valuation allowance reversals
are not considered part of our core operations.
We deﬁne return on equity (ROE) as Net income attributable to stockholders for the trailing four quarters divided by average equity for the same period.
Management uses average equity to provide comparable amounts in the calculation of ROE. The following table summarizes the calculation of ROE (dollars

Overview Our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve our goal of 9% to 10% margins on an EBIT—adjusted
basis (EBIT-adjusted margins, calculated as EBIT—adjusted divided by Net sales and revenue) by early next decade: earn customers for life by delivering great
products to our customers, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; lead in technology and innovation,
including OnStar 4G LTE and connected car, alternative propulsion, urban mobility including ride- and car-sharing through Maven and our investment in
Lyﬁ, active safety features and autonomous vehicles; grow our brands, particularly the Cadillac brand in the U.S. and China and the Chevrolet brand
globally; continue our growth in China; continue the growth of GM Financial into our full captive automotive ﬁnancing company; and deliver core
operating eﬁiciencies.
In addition to our EBIT—adjusted margin improvement goal, our overall ﬁnancial targets include expected total annual operational and functional cost
savings of $6.5 billion through 2018 compared to 2014 costs, of which approximately $4 billion has been realized as of December 31, 2016, and which we
expect will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2017 and beyond; and
execution of our capital allocation program as described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of this MD&A.
For the year ending December 31, 2017 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated ﬁnancial results including improved total net sales and
revenue, EBIT—adjusted and EBIT—adjusted margins that equal or exceed the corresponding amounts in 2016, ROIC-adjusted of greater than 25%,
Automotive operating cash ﬂow of approximately $15 billion, adjusted automotive free cash ﬂow of approximately $6 billion and BPS-diluted and EPS—
diluted—adjusted of between $6.00 and $6.50. We do not consider the potential future impact of adjustments on our expected ﬁnancial results. We expect
these ﬁnancial results in part to be driven by favorable shifts in mix for our new or refreshed product launches, including crossovers.

ﬂow (dollars in billions):
