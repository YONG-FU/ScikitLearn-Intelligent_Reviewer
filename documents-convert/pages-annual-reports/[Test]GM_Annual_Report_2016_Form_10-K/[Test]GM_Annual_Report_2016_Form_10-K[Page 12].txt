Automotive Financing - GM Financial GM Financial is our global captive automotive ﬁnance company and our global provider of automobile ﬁnance
solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, Europe, South America and through a joint venture in China.
GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum. Additionally GM Financial offers commercial products to dealers that
include new and used vehicle inventory ﬁnancing, inventory insurance, working capital, capital improvement loans, and storage center ﬁnancing.
In North America GM Financial's retail automobile ﬁnance programs include prime and sub-prime lending and full credit spectrum leasing. The sub-prime
lending program is primarily offered to consumers with FICO scores less than 620 who have limited access to automobile ﬁnancing through banks and credit
unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. The leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and
primarily targets prime consumers leasing new vehicles. GM Financial has expanded its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs through our
franchised dealers, and as a result, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of originations and the retail portfolio balance.
Internationally GM Financial’s retail automobile ﬁnance programs focus on prime quality ﬁnancing through loan and lease products.
Generally GM Financial seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily
ﬁnances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, through securitization transactions
where such markets are developed and through the issuance of unsecured debt in public markets including accepting deposits from retail banking customers
in Germany.
