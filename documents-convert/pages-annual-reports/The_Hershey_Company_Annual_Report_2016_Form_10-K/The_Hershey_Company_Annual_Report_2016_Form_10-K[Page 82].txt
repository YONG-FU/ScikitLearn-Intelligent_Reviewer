Investment objectives for our domestic plan assets are:
0 To ensure high correlation between the value of plan assets and liabilities;
° To maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class; and
° To focus on a long-term return objective.
We believe that there are no significant concentrations of risk within our plan assets as of December 31, 2016. We
comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”) and we prohibit investments and investment strategies not allowed by ERISA. We do not permit direct
purchases of our Company’s securities or the use of derivatives for the purpose of speculation. We invest the assets of
non-domestic plans in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans.
Cash Flows and Plan Termination
Our policy is to fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the ERISA, federal income
tax laws and the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension
liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans.
We made total contributions to the pension plans of $21,580 during 2016, including contributions of $18,000 to
maintain the funded status of our domestic plans. In 2015, we made total contributions of $32,898 to the pension
plans. For 2017, minimum funding requirements for our pension plans are approximately $1,158.
