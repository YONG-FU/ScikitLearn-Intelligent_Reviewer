Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, has evaluated the eﬁectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a—15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2016.
Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016.
Design and Evaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
