or leaving the Company as a result of this initiative. We have realized approximately $82 million in savings since
inception of the 2015 Productivity Initiative.
Other international restructuring programs
Other costs incurred in connection with business realignment activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 related
principally to accelerated depreciation and amortization and employee severance costs for multiple programs
commenced in 2014 to rationalize certain non—U.S. manufacturing and distribution activities and to establish our own
sales and distribution teams in Brazil in connection with our acquisition of the remaining 49% interest in Hershey do
Brasil Ltda. under a cooperative agreement with Pandurata Netherlands B.V. ("Bauducco").
Mauna Loa divestiture
In December 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation (“Mauna Loa”).
As a result of the expected sale, in 2014 we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale of $22.3 million to
reﬂect the disposal entity at fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. The sale, completed in the first quarter of
2015, resulted in an additional loss on sale of $2.7 million based on updates to the selling expenses and tax benefits.
Project Next Century
The 2014 costs shown relate primarily to the demolition of the Company’s former manufacturing facility, representing
the final phase of the Project Next Century program. As of December 31, 2014, we have concluded Project Next
Century.
Segment operating results do not include business realignment and related costs, as these initiatives are generally
centrally managed and are not included within our internal measures of segment performance.
Operating Proﬁt and Operating Proﬁt Margin
2016 compared with 2015
Operating profit increased 16.2% in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to lower goodwill and intangible asset
impairment charges, lower SM&A costs and lower business realignment costs, offset in part by the lower gross profit.
Operating profit margin increased to 16.2% in 2016 from 14.0% in 2015 due primarily to these same factors.
On a non-GAAP basis, 2016 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 2.4% and 40 basis points,
respectively, reﬂecting the reduction in total SM&A costs, including advertising and related consumer marketing,
offset in part by higher trade promotional spending.
2015 compared with 2014
Operating profit decreased 25.5% in 2015 compared with 2014 due primarily to the goodwill impairment charges,
higher SM&A costs related to acquisitions as well as higher business realignment costs, offset in part by the higher
gross profit. Operating profit margin decreased to 14.0% in 2015 from 18.8% in 2014 due to the goodwill impairment
charges, higher SM&A expenses as a percent of sales, and higher business realignment costs.
On a non-GAAP basis, 2015 operating profit and operating profit margin increased 1.8% and 40 basis points,
respectively.
