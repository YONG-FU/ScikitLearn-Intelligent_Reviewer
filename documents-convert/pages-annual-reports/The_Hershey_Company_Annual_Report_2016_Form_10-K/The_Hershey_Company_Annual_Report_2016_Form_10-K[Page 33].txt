currency net sales in Mexico and Brazil increased on a combined basis by approximately 13%, driven by solid
chocolate marketplace performance.
Our International and Other segment loss decreased $69.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Combined income in
Latin America and export markets improved versus the prior year and performance in China benefited from lower
direct trade and returns, discounts and allowances that were significantly lower than the prior year.
2015 compared with 2014
Net sales of our International and Other segment decreased $150.6 million or 14.1% in 2015 compared to 2014,
reﬂecting volume declines of 9.0%, an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 6.2% and
unfavorable net price realization of 4.0%, partially offset by incremental revenue from the acquisition of SGM
representing an increase of 5.1% to 2015 net sales. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange
rates, the net sales of our International and Other segment declined approximately 7.9%.
The net sales decline was driven by volume declines in our China chocolate business. In 2015, chocolate category
growth in China was ﬂat relative to the prior year; however our 2015 chocolate retail takeaway in China declined by
11%, resulting in a market share decline in China of 1.1%.
Performance in our focus markets of Mexico and Brazil improved and, on a constant currency basis, net sales in 2015
in these countries increased by approximately 6% and 3%, respectively, versus 2014. Constant currency net sales in
India declined in 2015, primarily due to the planned discontinuance of edible oil products.
Our International and Other segment loss was $98.1 million in 2015 compared to segment income of $40.0 million in
2014. The decline was primarily attributable to lower net sales of chocolate products in China, coupled with losses at
SGM as that business was also impacted by the uncertain macroeconomic conditions in China as well as incremental
integration-related costs.
Unallocated Corporate Expense
Unallocated corporate expense includes centrally-managed (a) corporate functional costs relating to legal, treasury,
finance and human resources, (b) expenses associated with the oversight and administration of our global operations,
including warehousing, distribution and manufacturing, information systems and global shared services, (c) non-cash
stock-based compensation expense and (d) other gains or losses that are not integral to segment performance.
Unallocated corporate expense totaled $497.4 million in both 2016 and 2015. Savings realized in 2016 from our
productivity and cost savings initiatives were oﬁset by higher employee-related costs and an increase in corporate
depreciation and amortization. As compared to 2014 unallocated corporate expense of $503.2 million, the reduction
in 2015 expense was driven primarily by the implementation of the 2015 Productivity Initiative discussed previously.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities.
Significant factors affecting liquidity include cash ﬂows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, the adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines
of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from
operations and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for capital reinvestment,
payment of dividends and strategic acquisitions.
