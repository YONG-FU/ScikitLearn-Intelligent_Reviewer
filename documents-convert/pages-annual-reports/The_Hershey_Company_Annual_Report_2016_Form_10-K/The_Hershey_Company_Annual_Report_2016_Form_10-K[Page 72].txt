NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar debt issues and is,
therefore, classified as Level 2 within the valuation hierarchy. The fair values and carrying values of long-term debt,
including the current portion, were as follows:
7 Fair Value 7 7 Carrying Value 7
At December 31, * 2016 2015 * * 2016 2015 *

Other Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, GAAP requires that, under
certain circumstances, we also record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are
recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. As discussed in Note 3, we
conducted an interim impairment test on the goodwill generated by the SGM acquisition, which resulted in impairment
charges totaling $280,802. In 2016 and 2014, as discussed in Note 3, in connection with our annual impairment
testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we recorded impairment charges totaling $4,204 and
$15,900, respectively. These charges were determined by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying value.
The fair value of the assets was derived using discounted cash ﬂow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.
As discussed in Note 2, in connection with the planned Mauna Loa divestiture, we classified the net assets as held for
sale as of December 31, 2014, resulting in a write down of $18,531 based upon the agreed-upon sales price and related
transaction costs. The loss was calculated based on Level 3 inputs and included in 2014 earnings.

The costs and related benefits of the Operational Optimization Program relate approximately 25% to the North
America segment and 75% to the International and Other segment. The costs and related benefits to be derived from
the 2015 Productivity Initiative relate primarily to the North American segment, while the costs and related benefits of
the other international programs relate primary to the International and Other segment. However, segment operating
