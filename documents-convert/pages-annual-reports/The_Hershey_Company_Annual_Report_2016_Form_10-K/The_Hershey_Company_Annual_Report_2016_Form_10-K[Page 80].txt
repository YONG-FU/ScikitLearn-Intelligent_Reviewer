THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
The weighted-average assumptions used in computing net periodic benefit cost were as follows:
7 Pension Beneﬁts 7 7 Other Beneﬁts 7
For the years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 7_7 2016 2015 2014 7
{Discount rate 4.0% 3.7% 4.5% 4.0% 3.7% 45%}
Expected long-term return on plan assets 61% 63% 7 0% N/A N/A N/A
’Rate of compensation increase 3.8% 4.1% 4.0% N/A N/A N/A ‘
The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate
bonds with maturities matching the plans’ expected benefit payment streams. The plans’ expected cash ﬂows are then
discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. We base the asset return assumption on current and expected asset
allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the plan asset categories.
For purposes of measuring our post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2016, we assumed a 7.0% annual
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2017, grading down to 5.0% by 2021. For
measurement purposes as of December 31, 2015, we assumed a 6.5% pre-65 and a 7.3% post-65 annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for 2016, grading down to 5.0% by 2019. Assumed
health care cost trend rates could have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement health care
plans. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:
One-Percentage One—Percentage
iImpact of assumed health care cost trend rates Point Increase Point Decrease 7
{Effect on total service and interest cost components 35 151 $ (132):
Effect on accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation 3,8 58 (3,373)
The valuations and assumptions reﬂect adoption of the Society of Actuaries updated RP-2014 mortality tables with
NIP-2016 generational projection scales, which we adopted as of December 31, 2016. Adoption of the updated scale
did not have a significant impact on our current pension obligations or net period benefit cost since our primary plans
are cash balance plans and most participants take lump-sum settlements upon retirement.
Plan Assets
We broadly diversify our pension plan assets across public equity, fixed income, diversified credit strategies and
diversified alternative strategies asset classes. Our target asset allocation for our major domestic pension plans as of
December 31, 2016 was as follows:
Asset Class _ Target Asset Allocation
I Cash 1% ‘
Equity securities 25%
’Fixed income securities 49% ‘
Alternative investments, including real estate, listed infrastructure and other 25%
As of December 31, 2016, actual allocations were consistent with the targets and within our allowable ranges. We
expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets within
each asset class.
