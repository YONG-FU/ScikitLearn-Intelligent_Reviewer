THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
as of July 5, 2015 using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business.
The results of this test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying amount as of the
measurement date, suggesting that a goodwill impairment was probable, which required us to perform a second step
analysis to confirm that an impairment exists and to determine the amount of the impairment based on our reassessed
value of the reporting unit. Although preliminary, as a result of this reassessment, in the second quarter of 2015 we
recorded an estimated $249,811 non-cash goodwill impairment charge, representing a write-down of all of the
goodwill related to the SGM reporting unit as of July 5, 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we increased the value
of acquired goodwill by $16,599, with the corresponding oﬁset principally represented by the establishment of
additional opening balance sheet liabilities (see Note 2). We also finalized the impairment test of the goodwill
relating to the SGM reporting unit, which resulted in a write-off of this additional goodwill in the third quarter, for a
total impairment of $266,409. At this time, we also tested the other long-lived assets of SGM for recoverability by
comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash ﬂows to the carrying value of the asset group, and no impairment was
indicated.
In connection with the 2014 SGM acquisition, we assigned approximately $15 million of goodwill to our existing
China chocolate business, as this reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale
of Golden Monkey-branded product through its Tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. As the net sales and
earnings of our China business continued to be adversely impacted by macroeconomic challenges and changing
consumer shopping behavior through the third quarter of 20 1 5, we determined that an interim impairment test of the
goodwill in this reporting unit was also required. We performed the first step of this test in the third quarter of 2015
using an income approach based on our estimates of future performance scenarios for the business. The results of this
test suggested that a goodwill impairment was probable, and the conclusions of the second step analysis resulted in a
write-down of $14,393, representing the full value of goodwill attributed to this reporting unit as of October 4, 2015.
In 2014, the annual impairment testing of our India reporting unit resulted in a $11,400 goodwill impairment charge
and a $4,500 pre-tax write-down of a trademark associated with the India business. These impairment charges were
largely a result of our decision to exit the oils portion of the India business and realign our approach to regional
marketing and distribution in India.
