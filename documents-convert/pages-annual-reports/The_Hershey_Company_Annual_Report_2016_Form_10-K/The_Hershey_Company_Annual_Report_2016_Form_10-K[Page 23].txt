Our 2017 projected EPS-diluted, as presented above, does not include the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses
on our commodity derivative contracts. Due to the volatility of commodity market prices, it is not possible to forecast
this mark-to-market impact. Pursuant to our revised accounting policy for commodity derivatives as discussed in Note
5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we currently reﬂect changes in the fair value of our commodity derivatives
as incurred within cost of goods sold, with an adjustment within our corporate unallocated expenses to enable us to
present the gains and losses on commodity derivatives within our segment income at the time the related inventory is
sold.
