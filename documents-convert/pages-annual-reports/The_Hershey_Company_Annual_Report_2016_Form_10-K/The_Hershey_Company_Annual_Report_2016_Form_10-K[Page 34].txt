Operating activities
Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash ﬂows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided by
operations are impacted by sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins
and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and
holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these
needs primarily with cash on hand, bank borrowings or the issuance of commercial paper.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased $231.0 million relative to 2015. This decrease was driven by
the following factors:
° Working capital (comprised of trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities)
consumed cash of $37 million in 2016, while it generated cash of $57 million in 2015. This $94 million
ﬂuctuation was mainly driven by an $87 million payment to settle an interest rate swap in connection with the
issuance of new debt in August 2016.
- Prepaid expenses and other current assets consumed cash of $43 million in 2016, while they generated cash of
$118 million in 2015. This $161 million ﬂuctuation was mainly driven by higher payments on commodity
futures contracts in 2016 as the market price of cocoa declined, versus receipts in the 2015 period. As noted
previously, we utilize commodity futures contracts to economically manage the risk of future price
ﬂuctuations associated with our purchase of raw materials.
- Net income adjusted for non-cash charges to operations (including depreciation, amortization, stock-based
compensation, excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, goodwill and other
intangible asset charges, write-down of equity investments, the gain on settlement of the SGM liability and
other charges) decreased cash ﬂow by $34 million in 2016 relative to 2015.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2015 increased $370.1 million relative to 2014. This increase was driven by
the following factors:
° Working capital (comprised of trade accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities)
generated cash of $57 million in 2015, while it consumed cash of $215 million in 2014. This ﬂuctuation was
mainly driven by lower inventory purchases in the 2015 period, since certain raw material inventory had been
built up at the preceding year-end to take advantage of favorable pricing.
- Prepaid expenses and other current assets generated cash of $1 1 8 million in 2015, while they consumed cash
of $7 million in 2014. This $125 million ﬂuctuation was mainly driven by our hedging activities, which
favorably impacted cash ﬂow by $55 million in 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of $78 million in 2014,
due principally to market gains and losses on our commodity futures contracts. Our cash receipts typically
increase when futures market prices are increasing.
- 2015 cash ﬂow was favorably impacted by approximately $30 million from the timing of tax payments in
2015 compared to 2014.
Pension and Post-RetirementActivity. We recorded net periodic benefit costs of $72.8 million, $66.8 million and
