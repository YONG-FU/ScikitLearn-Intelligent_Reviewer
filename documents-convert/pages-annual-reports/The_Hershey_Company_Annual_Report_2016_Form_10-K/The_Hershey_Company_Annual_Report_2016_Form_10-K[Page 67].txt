5. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
We are exposed to market risks arising principally from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity prices. We use certain derivative instruments to manage these risks. These include interest rate swaps to
manage interest rate risk, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options to manage foreign currency
exchange rate risk, and commodities futures and options contracts to manage commodity market price risk exposures.
In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by entering into exchanged-traded contracts with collateral
posting requirements and/or by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic
evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not
expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults.
Commodity Price Risk
We enter into commodities futures and options contracts and other commodity derivative instruments to reduce the
effect of future price ﬂuctuations associated with the purchase of raw materials, energy requirements and
transportation services. We generally hedge commodity price risks for 3- to 24-month periods. Our open commodity
derivative contracts had a notional value, assuming year-end market prices, of $739,374 as of December 31, 2016 and
$374,873 as of December 31, 2015. Through 2015, we designated the majority of our commodity derivative
instruments as cash ﬂow hedges under the hedge accounting requirements. Under hedge accounting, we account for
the effective portion of mark-to-market gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments in other comprehensive
income, to be recognized in cost of sales in the same period that we record the hedged raw material requirements in
cost of sales. The ineffective portion of gains and losses is recorded currently in cost of sales.
Eﬁective July 6, 2015 for cocoa commodity derivatives and January 1, 2016 for other commodity derivatives, we
discontinued the designation of any of our existing or new cocoa or other commodity derivatives for hedge accounting
treatment. Since such dates, changes in the fair value of these derivatives have been recorded as incurred within cost
of sales. Effective as of such dates, we also revised our definition of segment income to exclude gains and losses on
commodity derivatives until the related inventory is sold. This change to our definition of segment income enables us
to continue to align the derivative gains and losses with the underlying economic exposure being hedged and thereby
eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our reported segment income.
Foreign Exchange Price Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our international operations, including non—functional
currency intercompany debt and other non-functional currency transactions of certain subsidiaries. Principal
currencies hedged include the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, and Brazilian real. We typically utilize foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and options to hedge these exposures for periods ranging from 3 to 12 months.
The contracts are either designated as cash ﬂow hedges or are undesignated. The net notional amount of foreign
exchange contracts accounted for as cash ﬂow hedges was $68,263 at December 31, 2016 and $10,752 at
December 31, 2015. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these contracts is recorded in other
comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transactions aﬁect
earnings. The net notional amount of foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was
65
