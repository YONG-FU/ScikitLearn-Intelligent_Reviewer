The consumer takeaway and market share information provided above are for measured channels of distribution
accounting for approximately 90% of our US. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution primarily
include food, drug, mass merchandisers and convenience store channels, plus Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., partial dollar, club
and military channels. These metrics are based on measured market scanned purchases as reported by Nielsen and
provide a means to assess our retail takeaway and market position relative to the overall category.
The amounts presented above are solely for the US. CMG category which does not include revenue from our snack
mixes and grocery items. For the full year 2016, our CMG market share, including barkTHINS was 31.2%, about the
same as 2015. Including barkTHINS, CMG, salty snacks, snack bars, meat snacks and grocery items, our full year
US. market share increased approximately 10 basis points.
Cost of Sales and Gross Margin
2016 compared with 2015
Cost of sales increased 7.0% in 2016 compared with 2015. Incremental business realignment costs and mark-to-
market losses on commodity derivative instruments increased cost of sales by 5.3%, while the remaining increase was
primarily attributed to higher volume and higher supply chain costs, in part due to higher manufacturing variances and
some incremental fixed costs related to the commencement of manufacturing in the Malaysia facility. As described in
Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our commodity derivative instruments are no longer designated for
hedge accounting treatment and, as a result, the changes in fair market value are recognized currently in cost of sales.
Gross margin decreased by 340 basis points in 2016 compared with 2015. Mark-to-market losses on commodity
derivative instruments and incremental depreciation expense related to business realignment activities drove a 300
basis point decline in gross margin. Higher trade promotional spending and supply chain costs also contributed to the
decreased gross margin, but were partially offset by supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives. On a non-
GAAP basis, excluding the losses on commodity derivative instruments as well as business realignment costs, 2016
adjusted gross margin decreased by 40 basis points.
2015 compared with 2014
Cost of sales decreased 2.0% in 2015 compared with 2014. Supply chain productivity and volume declines reduced
cost of sales by approximately 6.6%. These declines were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity
costs, and unfavorable sales mix, which together increased total cost of sales by approximately 4.1%. In addition, cost
of sales was impacted by acquisition and integration costs of $7.3 million, business realignment costs of $8.8 million
and NSRPE of $2.5 million, which collectively increased cost of sales by approximately 0.5%. In comparison, cost of
sales benefited by $1.1 million in 2014, primarily due to NSRPI.
Gross margin increased by 80 basis points in 2015 compared with 2014. Favorable net price realization as well as
supply chain productivity and other cost savings initiatives collectively improved gross margin by 330 basis points.
However, these benefits were substantially offset by higher supply chain and commodity costs as well as unfavorable
sales mix, which collectively reduced gross margin by approximately 250 basis points. On a non-GAAP basis,
excluding the business realignment and acquisition and integration charges, 2015 gross margin increased by 110 basis
points.
Selling, Marketing and Administrative
2016 compared with 2015
Selling, marketing and administrative (“SM&A”) expenses decreased $53.9 million or 2.7% in 2016. Advertising and
related consumer marketing expense decreased 4.0% during this period. We spent less on advertising and related
consumer marketing in our International and Other segment, particularly in the China market, and our spending in
North America declined as our marketing mix models were weighted toward higher trade promotional spending.
Excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and administrative expenses for 2016
decreased by 2.0% as compared to 2015 as a result of our continued focus on reducing non-essential spending. SM&A
expenses in 2016 were also impacted by business realignment costs of $18.6 million, NSRPE of $15.2 million and
acquisition and integration costs of $6.5 million. In 2015, SM&A expenses included business realignment costs of
$17.4 million, NSRPE of $15.6 million and acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million.
