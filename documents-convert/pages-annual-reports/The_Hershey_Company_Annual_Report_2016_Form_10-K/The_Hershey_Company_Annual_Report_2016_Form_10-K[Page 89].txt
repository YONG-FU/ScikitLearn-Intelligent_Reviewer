13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations are primarily in the form of
forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the
effect of future price ﬂuctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations
consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using
market prices as of December 31, 2016.
The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future
periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent that we have entered into commodities futures contracts
or other commodity derivative instruments to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices
are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts or other commodity derivative instruments. Taking
delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies
our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2016, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities.
As of December 31, 2016, we had entered into agreements for the purchase of raw materials with various suppliers.
Subject to meeting our quality standards, the purchase obligations covered by these agreements were as follows as of
