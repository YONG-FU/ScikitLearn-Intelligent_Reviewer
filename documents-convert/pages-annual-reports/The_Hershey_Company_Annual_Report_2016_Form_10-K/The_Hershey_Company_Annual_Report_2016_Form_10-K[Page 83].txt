THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
Multiemployer Pension Plan
During 2016, we exited a facility as part of the 2016 Operational Optimization Program (see Note 7) and no longer
participate in the BCTGM Union and Industry Canadian Pension Plan, a trustee-managed multiemployer defined
benefit pension plan. Our obligation during the term of the collective bargaining agreement was limited to remitting
the required contributions to the plan and contributions made were not significant during 2014 through 2016.
Savings Plans
The Company sponsors several defined contribution plans to provide retirement benefits to employees. Contributions
to The Hershey Company 401(k) Plan and similar plans for non-domestic employees are based on a portion of eligible
pay up to a defined maximum. A11 matching contributions were made in cash. Expense associated with the defined
contribution plans was $43,545 in 2016, $44,285 in 2015 and $46,064 in 2014.
10. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
Share-based grants for compensation and incentive purposes are made pursuant to the Equity and Incentive
Compensation Plan (“EICP”). The EICP provides for grants of one or more of the following stock-based
compensation awards to employees, non-employee directors and certain service providers upon whom the successful
conduct of our business is dependent:
O Non-qualified stock options (“stock options”);
0 Performance stock units (“PSUS”) and performance stock;
0 Stock appreciation rights;
0 Restricted stock units (“RSUS”) and restricted stock; and
0 Other stock-based awards.
As of December 31, 2016, 68.5 million shares were authorized and approved by our stockholders for grants under the
EICP. The EICP also provides for the deferral of stock-based compensation awards by participants if approved by the
Compensation and Executive Organization Committee of our Board and if in accordance with an applicable deferred
compensation plan of the Company. Currently, the Compensation and Executive Organization Committee has
authorized the deferral of PSU and RSU awards by certain eligible employees under the Company’s Deferred
Compensation Plan. Our Board has authorized our non-employee directors to defer any portion of their cash retainer,
committee chair fees and RSUS awarded after 2007 that they elect to convert into deferred stock units under our
Directors’ Compensation Plan.
At the time stock options are exercised or RSUS and PSUs become payable, common stock is issued from our
accumulated treasury shares. Dividend equivalents are credited on RSUS on the same date and at the same rate as
dividends are paid on Hershey’s common stock. These dividend equivalents are charged to retained earnings.
For the periods presented, compensation expense for all types of stock-based compensation programs and the related
income tax benefit recognized were as follows:
For the years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 7
IPre-tax compensation expense $ 54,785 $ 51,533 $ 54,068 1
Related income tax benefit 17,148 17,109 18,653
Compensation costs for stock compensation plans are primarily included in selling, marketing and administrative
expense. As of December 31, 2016, total stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet
recognized was $60,963 and the weighted-average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized was
approximately 2.2 years.
