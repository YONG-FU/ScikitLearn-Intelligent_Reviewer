2015 compared with 2014
SM&A expenses increased $70.9 million or 3.7% in 2015. Advertising and related consumer marketing expense
increased 1.0% during this period. Excluding these advertising and related consumer marketing costs, selling and
administrative expenses for 2015 increased by 6.7% compared to 2014, driven by incremental increases from acquired
businesses. Excluding the impact of acquisition costs, SM&A expenses for 2015 declined as a result of our continued
focus on reducing non-essential spending. SM&A expenses in 2015 were also impacted by charges of $13.6 million
attributed to the productivity initiative we announced in June 2015, acquisition and integration costs of $13.6 million,
NSRPE of $15.6 million and other business realignment costs of $3.7 million. In 2014, SM&A expenses included
acquisition and integration costs of $12.4 million, other business realignment costs of $2.9 million and NSRPE of $0.9
million.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges
In 2016, in connection with the annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets, we recognized a
trademark impairment charge of $4.2 million, primarily resulting from plans to discontinue a brand sold in India.
As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the SGM business performed below expectations
throughout 2015, with net sales and earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels. As of result of this declining
performance, in the second quarter of 2015 we recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of $249.8 million
relating to the SGM reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2015, we updated our estimates of the acquisition-date
fair values of the net assets acquired, which increased the value of acquired goodwill by $16.6 million. We also
finalized the impairment test of the goodwill relating to the SGM reporting unit, which resulted in an additional $16.6
million write-off of this increase to goodwill. During the third quarter of 2015, we also wrote off $14.4 million of
goodwill that resulted from the SGM acquisition and was assigned to our existing China chocolate business, as this
reporting unit was expected to benefit from acquisition synergies relating to the sale of Golden Monkey-branded
product through its Tier 1 and hypermarket distributor networks. This goodwill impairment was driven by the
continued declining performance in our China chocolate business through the third quarter of 2015, as a result of the
macroeconomic challenges mentioned previously, as well as changing consumer shopping behavior in China.
In 2014, the annual impairment testing of our India reporting unit resulted in a $11.4 million goodwill impairment
charge and a $4.5 million write-down of a trademark associated with the India business. These impairment charges
were largely a result of our decision at the time to exit the oils portion of the India business and realign our approach to
regional marketing and distribution in India.
The assessment of the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets is based on management estimates and
assumptions, as discussed in our critical accounting policies included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
These estimates and assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions.
