merchandising displays, sales growth incentives, new item allowances and cooperative advertising. Sales, use, value-
added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 25%, 26% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales were made to
McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug
stores, Wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers and the primary distributor of our products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales represents costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of our products. Primary costs
include raw materials, packaging, direct labor, overhead, shipping and handling, warehousing and the depreciation of
manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities. Manufacturing overhead and related expenses include salaries,
wages, employee benefits, utilities, maintenance and property taxes.
Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expense
Selling, marketing and administrative expense (“SM&A”) represents costs incurred in generating revenues and in
managing our business. Such costs include advertising and other marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and
development, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of capitalized software and depreciation
of administrative facilities. Research and development costs, charged to expense as incurred, totaled $47,268 in 2016,
$49,281 in 2015 and $47,554 in 2014. Advertising expense is also charged to expense as incurred and totaled
$521,479 in 2016, $561,644 in 2015 and $570,223 in 2014. Prepaid advertising expense was $651 and $3,924 as of
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments, time deposits and money market funds with original
maturities of three months or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments consist of bank term deposits that have original maturity dates ranging from greater than three
months to twelve months. Short-term investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
Accounts ReceivableiTrade
In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria, based upon the
results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of current and projected economic conditions.
Our primary concentrations of credit risk are associated with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and McLane Company, Inc., two
customers served principally by our North America segment. As of December 31, 2016, McLane Company, Inc.
accounted for approximately 19% of our total accounts receivable. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for approximately
14% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of
our year-end accounts receivable. We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the
remainder of our customer base. Accounts receivable-trade in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is presented net of
allowances and anticipated discounts of $40,153 and $32,638 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value, adjusted for the value of inventory that is estimated to be
excess, obsolete or otherwise unsaleable. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 54% of our inventories,
representing the majority of our US inventories, were valued under the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. The
remainder of our inventories in the US and inventories for our international businesses are valued at the lower of
first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost or market. LIFO cost of inventories valued using the LIFO method was $402,919 as of
December 31, 2016 and $410,865 as of December 31, 2015. The adjustment to LIFO, as shown in Note 16,
approximates the excess of replacement cost over the stated LIFO inventory value. The net impact of LIFO
acquisitions and liquidations was not material to 2016, 2015 or 2014.
