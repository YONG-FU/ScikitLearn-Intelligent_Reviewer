The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $27,691 as of
December 31, 2016 and $25,947 as of December 31, 2015.
We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized a
net tax benefit of $75 in 2016, a net tax expense of $1,153 in 2015 and a net tax benefit of $9,082 in 2014 for interest
and penalties. Accrued net interest and penalties were $3,716 as of December 31, 2016 and $3,791 as of December 31,

We file income tax returns in the US. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. A number of
years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefits, is audited and finally
resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain
tax position, we believe that our unrecognized tax benefits reﬂect the most likely outcome. We adjust these
unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of
any particular position could require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our
effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions
include the United States (federal and state), Canada, China and Mexico. U.S., Canadian, Chinese and Mexican
federal audit issues typically involve the timing of deductions and transfer pricing adjustments. Tax examinations by
the US. Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities could be conducted for years beginning in 2013.
We are no longer subject to Canadian federal income tax examinations by the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for
years before 2007. In 2013, the CRA concluded its audit for 2007 through 2009 and issued a letter to us indicating
proposed adjustments primarily associated with business realignment charges and transfer pricing. In 2014, the CRA
withdrew the proposed adjustments related to business realignment charges and transfer pricing of inventory, and we
paid a $1,600 assessment related to other cross—border adjustments. Also in 2014, the CRA concluded its audit for
2010 through 2012 and issued a letter to us indicating proposed transfer pricing adjustments, and we paid a $612
assessment. We provided notice to the US. Competent Authority and the CRA provided notice to the Canada
