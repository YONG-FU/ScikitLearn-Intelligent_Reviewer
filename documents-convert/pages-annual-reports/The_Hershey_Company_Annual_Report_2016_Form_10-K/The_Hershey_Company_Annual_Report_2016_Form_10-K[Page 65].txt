4. SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT
Short-term Debt
As a source of short-term financing, we utilize cash on hand and commercial paper or bank loans with an original
maturity of three months or less. We maintain a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which currently
expires in November 2020. This agreement also includes an option to increase borrowings by an additional $400,000
with the consent of the lenders. On June 16, 2016, we entered into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility
that provided for borrowings up to $500,000. We terminated this facility, which was scheduled to expire on June 15,
2017, effective October 24, 2016.
The unsecured committed revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant whereby the ratio of (a) pre-tax
income from operations from the most recent four fiscal quarters to (b) consolidated interest expense for the most
recent four fiscal quarters may not be less than 2.0 to 1.0 at the end of each fiscal quarter. The credit agreement also
contains customary representations, warranties and events of default. Payment of outstanding advances may be
accelerated, at the option of the lenders, should we default in our obligation under the credit agreement. As of
December 31, 2016, we complied with all customary affirmative and negative covenants and the financial covenant
pertaining to our credit agreement. There were no significant compensating balance agreements that legally restricted
these ﬁands.
In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial
banks. Our credit limit in various currencies was $504,237 at December 31, 2016 and $516,916 at December 31,
2015. These lines permit us to borrow at the respective banks’ prime commercial interest rates, or lower. We had
short-term foreign bank loans against these lines of credit for $158,805 at December 31, 2016 and $313,520 at
December 31, 2015. Commitment fees relating to our revolving credit facility and lines of credit are not material.
At December 31, 2016, we had outstanding commercial paper totaling $473,666, at a weighted average interest rate of
0.6%. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding commercial paper totaling $49,993, at a weighted average interest
rate of 0.4%.
The maximum amount of short-term borrowings outstanding during 2016 was $997,120. The weighted-average
interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was 1.0% as of December 31, 2016 and 3.0% as of December 31,
20 1 5.
