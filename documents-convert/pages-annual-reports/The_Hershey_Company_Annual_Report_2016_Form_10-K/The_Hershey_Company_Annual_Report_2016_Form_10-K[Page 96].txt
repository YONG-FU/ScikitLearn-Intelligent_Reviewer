MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of The Hershey Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule l3a-15(f). The Company’s internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and Board of Directors regarding
the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation.
The Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 3 l, 2016. In making this
assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 edition). Based on this
assessment, management concluded that, as of December 3 l, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.
The Company’s independent auditors have audited, and reported on, the Company ’5 internal control over financial
reporting as of December 3 l, 2016.
