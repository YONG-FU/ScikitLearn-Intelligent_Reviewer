THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
We recognized a gain of approximately $4,627 in connection with this transaction, primarily related to the
remeasurement of the fair value of our equity interest immediately before the business combination. The gain is
included in other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31,
2014. Additionally, cash acquired in the transaction exceeded the $5,580 paid for the controlling interest by $10,035,
resulting in a positive cash impact from the acquisition as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for
the year ended December 31, 2014.
Pro Forma Presentation and Acquisition Costs
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for these aforementioned acquisitions, as the impact to our
consolidated financial statements was not material. In 2014, we incurred net acquisition-related costs primarily related
to the SGM acquisition of $13,270. These costs primarily consisted of third-party advisory fees and are recorded
within selling, marketing and administrative costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income, with the exception of the
2014 costs reﬂecting net foreign currency exchange losses relating to our strategy to cap the SGM acquisition price as
denominated in US dollars, which are recorded within other (income) expense, net. Acquisition costs incurred in
2016 and 2015 were not significant.
2015 Divestiture
In December 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation (“Mauna Loa”),
a business that had historically been reported within our North America segment. The transaction closed in the first
quarter of 2015, resulting in proceeds, net of selling expenses and an estimated working capital adjustment, of
approximately $32,400. As a result of the expected sale, in 2014, we recorded an estimated loss on the anticipated sale
of $22,256 to reﬂect the disposal entity at fair value, less an estimate of the selling costs. This amount included
impairment charges totaling $18,531 to write down goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, based
on the valuation of these assets as implied by the agreed-upon sales price. The sale of Mauna Loa resulted in the
recording of an additional loss on sale of $2,667 in the first quarter of 2015, based on updates to the selling expenses
and tax benefits. The loss on the sale is reﬂected within business realignment costs in the Consolidated Statements of
Income.

The $280,802 impairment charge recorded in 2015 resulted from our interim reassessment of the valuation of the SGM
business, coupled with the write-down of goodwill attributed to the China chocolate business in connection with the
SGM acquisition, as discussed below.
In the second quarter of 2015, since the SGM business had been performing below expectations, with net sales and
earnings levels well below pre-acquisition levels, we performed an interim impairment test of the SGM reporting unit
