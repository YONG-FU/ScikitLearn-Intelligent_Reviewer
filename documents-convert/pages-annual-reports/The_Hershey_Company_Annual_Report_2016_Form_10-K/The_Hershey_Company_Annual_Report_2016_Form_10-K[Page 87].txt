THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
Certain manufacturing, warehousing, distribution and other activities supporting our global operations are integrated to
maximize eﬁiciency and productivity. As a result, assets and capital expenditures are not managed on a segment basis
and are not included in the information reported to the CODM for the purpose of evaluating performance or allocating
resources. We disclose depreciation and amortization that is generated by segment-specific assets, since these amounts
are included within the measure of segment income reported to the CODM.
Our segment net sales and earnings were as follows:
