Performance Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units
Under the EICP, we grant PSUs to selected executives and other key employees. Vesting is contingent upon the
achievement of certain performance objectives. We grant PSUs over 3-year performance cycles. If we meet targets
for financial measures at the end of the applicable 3-year performance cycle, we award a resulting number of shares of
our Common Stock to the participants. For PSUs granted, the target award is a combination of a market-based total
shareholder return and performance-based components. The performance scores for 2014 through 2016 grants of
PSUs can range from 0% to 250% of the targeted amounts.
We recognize the compensation cost associated with PSUs ratably over the 3-year term. Compensation cost is based
on the grant date fair value because the grants can only be settled in shares of our Common Stock. The grant date fair
value of PSUs is determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation model for the market-based total shareholder return
component and the closing market price of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant for performance-based
components.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we awarded RSUs to certain executive officers and other key employees under the EICP. We
also awarded RSUs quarterly to non-employee directors.
We recognize the compensation cost associated with employee RSUs over a specified award vesting period based on
the grant date fair value or year-end market value of our Common Stock. We recognize expense for employee RSUs
based on the straight-line method. We recognize the compensation cost associated with non-employee director RSUs
ratably over the vesting period.
A summary of activity relating to grants of PSUs and RSUs for the period ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:

The table above excludes PSU awards for 6,410 units as of December 31, 2016 and 20,586 units as of December 31,
2015 for which the measurement date has not yet occurred for accounting purposes.
The following table sets forth information about the fair value of the PSUs and RSUs granted for potential future
distribution to employees and non-employee directors. In addition, the table provides assumptions used to determine
the fair value of the market-based total shareholder return component using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the
date of grant.
