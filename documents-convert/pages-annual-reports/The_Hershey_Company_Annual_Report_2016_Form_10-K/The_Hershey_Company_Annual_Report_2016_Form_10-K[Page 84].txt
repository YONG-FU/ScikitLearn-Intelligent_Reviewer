Stock Options
The exercise price of each stock option awarded under the EICP equals the closing price of our Common Stock on the
New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Each stock option has a maximum term of 10 years. Grants of stock
options provide for pro-rated vesting, typically over a four year period. Expense for stock options is based on grant
date fair value and recognized on a straight-line method over the vesting period.
A summary of activity relating to grants of stock options for the year ended December 31, 2016 is as follows:

The weighted-average fair value of options granted was $11.46, $18.99 and $21.50 per share in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The fair value was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the
following weighted-average assumptions:
For the years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 7
l Dividend yields 2.4% 2.1% 20%}
Expected volatility 16.8% 20.7% 22.3%
[Risk—free interest rates 1.5% 1.9% 21%}
Expected term in years 6.8 6.7 6.7
O “Dividend yields” means the sum of dividends declared for the four most recent quarterly periods,
divided by the average price of our Common Stock for the comparable periods;
0 “Expected volatility” means the historical volatility of our Common Stock over the expected term of
each grant;
0 “Risk-free interest rates” means the US. Treasury yield curve rate in effect at the time of grant for
periods within the contractual life of the stock option; and
0 “Expected term” means the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding
based primarily on historical data.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $73,944, $66,161 and $133,948 in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, there was $16,372 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non—vested stock
option awards granted under the EICP, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.
