obligations. This legislation makes it more diﬁicult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting
stock and thereby may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.
Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that
we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

(1) Includes the net interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt and associated interest rate swaps. Interest associated with
variable rate debt was forecasted using the LIBOR forward curve as of December 31, 2016.
(2) Includes the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices, retail stores,
warehouses and distribution facilities.
(3) Represents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. Our policy is to fund domestic pension
liabilities in accordance with the minimum and maximum limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”), federal income tax laws and the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non—domestic
pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. For more information, see Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
(4) Purchase obligations consist primarily of fixed commitments for the purchase of raw materials to be utilized in the normal
course of business. Amounts presented included fixed price forward contracts and unpriced contracts that were valued using market
prices as of December 31, 2016. The amounts presented in the table do not include items already recorded in accounts payable or
accrued liabilities at year-end 2016, nor does the table reﬂect cash ﬂows we are likely to incur based on our plans, but are not
obligated to incur. Such amounts are part of normal operations and are reﬂected in historical operating cash ﬂow trends. We do not
believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.
In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to
contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio
of qualified counterparties. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect
any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our
asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or
dispose of asbestos in a specified manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We do not
have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We
cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not
available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and
maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
