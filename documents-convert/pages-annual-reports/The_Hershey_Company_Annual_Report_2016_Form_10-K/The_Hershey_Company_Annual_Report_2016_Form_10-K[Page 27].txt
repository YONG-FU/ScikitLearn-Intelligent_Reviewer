Operational Optimization Program
In the second quarter of 20 16, we commenced a program (the “Operational Optimization Program”) to optimize our
production and supply chain network, which includes select facility consolidations. The program encompasses the
continued transition of our China chocolate and SGM operations into a united Golden Hershey platform, including the
integration of the China sales force, as well as workforce planning eﬁorts and the consolidation of production within
certain facilities in China and North America.
We have incurred pre-tax costs of $88 million to date, including non-cash asset-related incremental depreciation costs,
severance and employee benefit costs, costs to consolidate and relocate production, and third-party costs incurred to
execute these activities. We currently expect to incur additional cash costs of approximately $37 million over the next
two years to complete this program. The Operational Optimization Program is expected to drive annual savings of
approximately $52 million by 2018.
2015 Productivity Initiative
In mid-2015, we initiated a productivity initiative (the “2015 Productivity Initiative”) intended to move decision
making closer to the customer and the consumer, to enable a more enterprise-wide approach to innovation, to more
swiftly advance our knowledge agenda, and to provide for a more efficient cost structure, while ensuring that we
effectively allocate resources to future growth areas. Overall, the 2015 Productivity Initiative was undertaken to
simplify the organizational structure to enhance the Company's ability to rapidly anticipate and respond to the
changing demands of the global consumer.
The 2015 Productivity Initiative was executed throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2015, resulting in a net
reduction of approximately 300 positions, with the majority of the departures taking place by the end of 2015. For the
year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred charges totaling $19.3 million, consisting of pension settlement charges,
adjustments to estimated severance benefits and incremental third-party costs related to the design and implementation
of the new organizational structure. The 2015 Productivity Initiative was completed during the third quarter of 2016.
We incurred total costs of $125.0 million relating to this initiative, including pension settlement charges of $13.7
million recorded in 2016 and $10.2 million recorded in 2015 relating to lump sum withdrawals by employees retiring
