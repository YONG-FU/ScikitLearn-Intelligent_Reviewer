In the assessment of our results, we review and discuss the following financial metrics that are derived from the
reported and non-GAAP financial measures presented above:
For the years ended December 31,
2016 2015 2014
’As reported gross margin 42.4% 45.8% 45 0%:
Non—GAAP gross margin (1) 45.6% 46.0% 44.9%
I 1
As reported operating profit margin 16.2% 14.0% 18.8%
’Non-GAAP operating profit margin (2) 20.4% 20.0% 19.6%}
lAs reported effective tax rate 34.5% 43.1% 35 2%}
Non—GAAP effective tax rate (3) 31.3% 33.2% 34.5%
(1) Calculated as non—GAAP gross profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(2) Calculated as non—GAAP operating profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.
(3) Calculated as non—GAAP provision for income taxes as a percentage of non-GAAP income before taxes (calculated as
non—GAAP operating profit minus non—GAAP interest expense, net plus or minus non-GAAP other (income) expense,
net).
Details of the activities impacting comparability that are presented as reconciling items to derive the non-GAAP
financial measures in the tables above are as follows:
Mark-to-market losses on commodity derivatives
Commensurate with our discontinuance of hedge accounting treatment for commodity derivatives, we are adjusting the
mark-to-market losses on such commodity derivatives, until such time as the related inventory is sold. Since we often
purchase commodity contracts to price inventory requirements in future years, we make this adjustment to facilitate the
year-over-year comparison of cost of sales on a basis that matches the derivative gains and losses with the underlying
economic exposure being hedged for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, unallocated mark-to-market
losses on commodity derivatives totaled $163.2 million.
Business realignment activities
We periodically undertake restructuring and cost reduction activities as part of ongoing eﬁorts to enhance long-term
profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we incurred $107.6 million, $121.0 million and
$34.3 million, respectively, of pre-tax costs related to business realignment activities. See Note 7 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information.
Acquisition integration costs
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred expenses totaling $6.5 million related to integration of the 2016
acquisition of Ripple Brand Collective, LLC, as we incorporated this business into our operating practices and
information systems. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred costs related to the integration of the 2014
acquisitions of SGM and The Allan Candy Company and the 2015 acquisition of Krave totaling $22.5 million as we
incorporated these businesses into our operating practices and information systems. These 2015 expenses included
charges incurred to write-down approximately $6.4 million of expired or near-expiration work-in-process inventory at
SGM, in connection with the implementation of our global quality standards and practices. In addition, integration
costs for 2015 were oﬁset by a $6.8 million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration paid to the Krave
shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred costs of $13.3 million largely related to the
acquisition of SGM, offset by a $4.6 million gain relating to the acquisition of a controlling interest in Lotte Shanghai
Foods Co., Ltd.
