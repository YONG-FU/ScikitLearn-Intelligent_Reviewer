THE HERSHEY C OlVIPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(amounts in thousands, except share data or if otherwise indicated)
Future minimum rental payments reﬂect commitments under non-cancelable operating leases primarily for offices,
retail stores, warehouse and distribution facilities. Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014 was $20,330, $19,754 and $21,423, respectively, including short-term rentals.
Environmental contingencies
We have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our
asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations, which require that we handle or
dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We do not have
sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We
cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not
available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and
maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of significant quantities of asbestos.
Legal contingencies
We are subject to various pending or threatened legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our
business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of such proceedings and claims with certainty, in
our opinion these matters, both individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material effect on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
