(1) The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is the difference between the contract and
current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign
currency forward exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward
rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity diﬁerences.
(2) The fair value of interest rate swap agreements represents the difference in the present value of cash ﬂows
calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period. We
calculate the fair value of interest rate swap agreements quarterly based on the quoted market price for the
same or similar financial instruments.
(3) The fair value of deferred compensation derivatives is based on quoted prices for market interest rates and a
broad market equity index.
(4) The fair value of commodities futures and options contracts is based on quoted market prices.
Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
short-term debt approximated fair values as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 because of the relatively
short maturity of these instruments.
