2016, we generated cash ﬂow of $275.6 million through short-term commercial paper borrowings, partially
offset by payments in short-term foreign borrowings. In 2015, we generated cash ﬂow of $10.7 million as a
result of higher borrowings at certain of our international businesses. In 2014, we generated additional cash

° Share repurchases. We repurchase shares of Common Stock to oﬁset the dilutive impact of treasury shares
issued under our equity compensation plans. The value of these share repurchases in a given period varies
based on the volume of stock options exercised and our market price. In addition, we periodically repurchase
shares of Common Stock pursuant to Board-authorized programs intended to drive additional stockholder
value. We used cash for total share repurchases of $592.6 million in 2016, compared to $582.5 million in
2015. This included purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $420.2 million to purchase 4.6 million
shares in 2016 and $402.5 million to purchase 4.2 million shares in 2015. We used cash for total share
repurchases of $576.8 million in 2014, which included purchases pursuant to authorized programs of $202.3
million to purchase 2.1 million shares. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $100 million remained
available under the $500 million share repurchase authorization approved by the Board in January 2016.

- Proceeds from the exercise of stock options, including tax beneﬁts. We received $124.8 million from
employee exercises of stock options, including excess tax benefits, in 2016, as compared to $97.6 million in
2015 and $175.8 million in 2014. Variances are driven primarily by the number of shares exercised and the
share price at the date of grant.
° Other In February 2016, we used $35.8 million to purchase the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of
SGM. In September 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil Ltda. under a
cooperative agreement with Bauducco for approximately $38.3 million. Additionally, in December 2015, we
paid $10.0 million in contingent consideration to the shareholders of Krave.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $297.0 million. At December 31, 2015, our cash and
cash equivalents totaled $346.5 million. Our cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016 declined $49.5 million
compared to the 2015 year-end balance as a result of the net uses of cash outlined in the previous discussion.
Approximately two-thirds of the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 was held by
subsidiaries domiciled outside of the United States. If these amounts held outside of the United States were to be
repatriated, under current law they would be subject to US. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.
However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States. The cash that our foreign
subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is expected to be used to finance foreign operations and investments. We
believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs, including our cash needs in the United States.
