forward exchange contracts and options, commodities futures and options contracts, and other commodity derivative
instruments expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $7,824 as of
December 31, 2016. This amount was primarily associated with interest rate swap agreements.
Fair Value Hedgﬁ
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a net pretax benefit to interest expense of $4,365 and
$6,905 relating to our fixed-to-ﬂoating interest swap arrangements.
6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Accounting guidance on fair value measurements requires that financial assets and liabilities be classified and
disclosed in one of the following categories of the fair value hierarchy:
Level 1 —- Based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.
Level 2 —- Based on observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3 —- Based on unobservable inputs that reﬂect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that a market
participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.
We did not have any level 3 financial assets or liabilities, nor were there any transfers between levels during the
periods presented.
