other post retirement plans). The main drivers of ﬂuctuations in expense from year to year are assumptions in
formulating our long-term estimates, including discount rates used to value plan obligations, expected returns on plan
assets, the service and interest costs and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses.
The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on
invested assets, the level of market interest rates and the level of funding. We contribute cash to our plans at our
discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Cash contributions to our
pension and post retirement plans totaled $41.7 million, $53.3 million and $53.1 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.
Investing activities
Our principal uses of cash for investment purposes relate to purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized
software, purchases of short-term investments and acquisitions of businesses, partially offset by proceeds from sales of
property, plant and equipment and short-term investments. We used cash of $595.5 million for investing activities in
2016 compared to $477.2 million in 2015, with the increase driven by additional business acquisition activity. We
used cash of $862.6 million for investing activities in 2014, which was primarily driven by additional business
acquisition activity and purchases of short-term investments.
Primary investing activities include the following:
0 Capital spending. Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, primarily to support capacity
expansion, innovation and cost savings, were $269.5 million in 2016, $356.8 million in 2015 and $370.8
million in 2014. The reduction in 2016 was largely due to completion of the Malaysia plant construction
early in the year. Our 2015 and 2014 expenditures included approximately $80 million and $115 million,
respectively, relating to the Malaysia plant construction. Capitalized software additions were primarily
related to ongoing enhancements of our information systems. We expect 2017 capital expenditures, including
capitalized software, to approximate $270 million to $290 million.
0 Acquisitions and divestitures. In 2016, we spent $285.4 million to acquire Ripple Brand Collective, LLC. In
2015, we spent $218.7 million to acquire Krave, partially offset by net cash received of $32 million from the
sale of Mauna Loa. In 2014, we spent $396.3 million to acquire three businesses, including $379.7 million for
SGM and $26.6 million for Allan Candy, partially offset by net cash received of $10.0 million relating to the
acquisition of an additional 5.9% interest in Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd., a joint venture established in
2007 in China, whereby cash acquired in the transaction exceeded the $5.6 million paid for the controlling
interest. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our recent
acquisitions.
- Investments in partnerships qualz'ﬁzing for tax credits. We make investments in partnership entities that in
turn make equity investments in projects eligible to receive federal historic and energy tax credits. We
invested approximately $13.5 million more in projects qualifying for tax credits in 2016 compared to 2015.
° Short-term investments. We had no short-term investment activity in 2016. In 2015, we received proceeds of
$95 million from the sale of short-term investments, which had been purchased in 2014 for approximately
$97 million.
Financing activities
Our cash ﬂow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our Common Stock and
payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from the exercise of stock options. We used cash
of $434.4 million for financing activities in 2016 compared to $755.2 million in 2015, with the decrease due mainly to
higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term borrowings, partially oﬁset by the purchase of the remaining 20% of
the outstanding shares of SGM and higher dividend payments in 2016. We used cash of $719.3 million for financing
activities in 2014, primarily to fund dividend payments and share repurchases.
The majority of our financing activity was attributed to the following:
° Short-term borrowings, net. In addition to utilizing cash on hand, we use short-term borrowings (commercial
paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. In
