We believe that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to
realize the net deferred tax assets. Changes in deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards resulted
primarily from current year losses in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in deferred tax assets for derivative instruments
resulted primarily from the tax impact of our payment to settle an interest rate swap in 2016.
The valuation allowances as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are primarily related to US. capital loss carryforwards
and various foreign jurisdictions' net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets that we do not expect
to realize.
