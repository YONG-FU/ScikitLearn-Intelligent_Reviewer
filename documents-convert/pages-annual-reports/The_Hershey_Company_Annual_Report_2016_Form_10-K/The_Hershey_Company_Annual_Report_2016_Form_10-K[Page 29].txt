Interest Expense, Net
2016 compared with 2015
Net interest expense was $15.6 million lower in 2016 than in 2015, as the 2015 amount included the premium paid to
repurchase long-term debt as part of a cash tender oﬁer. This decrease was partially offset by lower capitalized
interest expense and lower interest income.
2015 compared with 2014
Net interest expense was $22.3 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 due primarily to the premium paid to repurchase
long-term debt as part of a cash tender offer. This increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest expense
coupled with savings resulting from fixed-to-ﬂoating interest rate swap agreements put in place toward the end of
20 14.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
2016 compared with 2015
Other (income) expense, net was $13.9 million lower in 2016 than 2015, due primarily to the $26.7 million settlement
of the SGM liability in 2016, partially offset by an increase in the write-down of equity investments qualifying for
federal historic and energy tax credits.
2015 compared with 2014
Other (income) expense, net was $27.4 million higher in 2015 than 2014, due primarily to the write-down of equity
investments qualifying for federal historic and energy tax credits, partially offset by the gain on the sale of a non-core
trademark.
Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate
2016 compared with 2015
Our effective income tax rate was 34.5% for 2016 compared with 43.1% for 2015. The 2015 tax rate was significantly
impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and
other non-GAAP charges, the 2016 effective income tax rate was 190 basis points lower than the 2015 rate. The 2016
non-GAAP rate reﬂects greater benefit from manufacturing deductions, research and development and investment tax
credits, and a favorable foreign rate diﬁerential relating to our cocoa procurement operations.
2015 compared with 2014
Our effective income tax rate was 43.1% for 2015 compared with 35.2% for 2014. The 2015 tax rate was significantly
impacted by the non-deductible goodwill impairment charges. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and
other non-GAAP charges, the 2015 effective income tax rate was 130 basis points lower than the 2014 rate. The 2015
rate benefited from tax credits realized from the investment tax strategy initiated in the second quarter of 2015, which
was partially offset by the valuation allowance recorded against the SGM net operating loss carryforwards.
Net Income and Net Income Per Share
2016 compared with 2015
Net income increased $207.0 million, or 40.4%, while BPS-diluted increased $1.02, or 44.0%, in 2016 compared with
2015. The increases in both net income and BPS-diluted were driven by the lower goodwill and intangible asset
impairment charges, lower SM&A costs and lower business realignment costs, as noted above. Our 2016 EPS-diluted
also benefited from lower weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our Board-
approved repurchase programs.
On a non-GAAP basis, net income increased $38.8 million in 2016, or 4.3%, and BPS-diluted increased $0.29, or
7.0%, as compared with 2015. The increases in 2016 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP BPS-diluted were
primarily driven by the lower SM&A expense as well as the lower tax rate.
