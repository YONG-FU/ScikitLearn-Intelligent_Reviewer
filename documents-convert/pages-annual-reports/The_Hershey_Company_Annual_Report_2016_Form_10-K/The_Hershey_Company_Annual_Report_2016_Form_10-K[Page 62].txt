* Note that the final opening balance sheet value of goodwill presented in the schedule above differs from total write-off of
$280.8 million due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since the date of acquisition (see Note 3).
On February 3, 2016, we completed the purchase of the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares of SGM for cash
consideration totaling $35,762, pursuant to a new agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of 2015 with the
selling SGM shareholders which revised the originally-agreed purchase price for these shares. For accounting
purposes, we treated the acquisition as if we had acquired 100% at the initial acquisition date in 2014 and financed the
payment for the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares. Therefore, the cash settlement of the liability for the
purchase of these remaining shares is reﬂected within the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.
The final settlement also resulted in an extinguishment gain of $26,650 representing the net carrying amount of the
recorded liability in excess of the cash paid to settle the obligation for the remaining 20% of the outstanding shares.
This gain is recorded within non-operating other (income) expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Allan Candy Company Limited
In December 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey Canada Inc., completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding shares of The Allan Candy Company Limited (“Allan”) for cash consideration of approximately $27,376.
Allan is headquartered in Ontario, Canada and manufactures certain non-chocolate products on behalf of Hershey, in
addition to manufacturing and distributing its own branded products, principally in Canada. The preliminary purchase
price allocation includes fixed assets of $10,897, goodwill of $6,996, other intangible assets of $8,092, and other net
assets of $1,391. During the first half of 2015, we increased goodwill by $1,820 to recognize revisions to the
preliminary fair value of net assets acquired.
Lotte Shanghai Food Company
In March 2014, we acquired an additional 5.9% interest in Lotte Shanghai Foods Co., Ltd. (“LSFC”), a joint venture
established in 2007 in China for the purpose of manufacturing and selling product to the venture partners. For this
additional interest, we paid $5,580 in cash, increasing our ownership from 44.1% to 50%. At the same time, we also
amended the LSFC shareholders' agreement resulting in our operational control over the venture. With the additional
operational control, we reassessed our involvement with LSFC and concluded that we have a controlling financial
interest. Therefore, we consolidated the venture as of the March 2014 acquisition date. We had previously accounted
for our investment in LSFC using the equity method.
Total consideration transferred was approximately $99,161, including the $5,5 80 cash consideration paid, the
estimated fair value of our previously held equity interest of $43,857 and the estimated fair value of the remaining
noncontrolling interest in LSFC of $49,724, which fair values were determined using a market-based approach. The
fair value of the LSFC assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date was $99,449, including fixed
assets of $106,253, short-term debt obligations of $13,292 and other net assets of $6,488.
