Our costs for cocoa products will not necessarily reﬂect market price ﬂuctuations because of our forward purchasing
and hedging practices, premiums and discounts reﬂective of varying delivery times, and supply and demand for our
specific varieties and grades of cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and cocoa powder. As a result, the average futures contract
prices are not necessarily indicative of our average costs.
During 2016, prices for ﬂuid dairy milk ranged from a low of $0. 13 per pound to a high of $0. 15 per pound, on a Class
IV milk basis. Dairy prices were lower than 2015, driven by increased production in Europe and the United States as
well as larger dairy product inventories globally.
The price of sugar is subject to price supports under US. farm legislation. Such legislation establishes import quotas
and duties to support the price of sugar. As a result, sugar prices paid by users in the United States are currently higher
than prices on the world sugar market. United States delivered east coast refined sugar prices traded in a range from
$0.33 to $0.39 per pound during 2016.
Peanut prices in the United States began the year around $0.46 per pound and closed the year at $0.65 per pound.
Drought conditions throughout 2016 in the key Southeast peanut growing region resulted in an estimated 5% smaller
crop versus the 2015 crop and drove price increases. Almond prices began the year at $3.53 per pound and decreased
to $2.84 per pound during 2016. Almond supply is ample to support US. demand heading into 2017 as the 2016 crop
is expected to be approximately 11% larger than the 2015 crop. (Source: Almond Board of California)
We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reﬂecting changes in the
value of futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange or various other exchanges. These changes in value
represent unrealized gains and losses. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of
future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs.
Commodity Sensitivity Analysis
Our open commodity derivative contracts had a notional value of $739.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $374.8
million as of December 31, 2015. At the end of 2016, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative
instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized
losses in 2016 by $73.9 million, generally offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
