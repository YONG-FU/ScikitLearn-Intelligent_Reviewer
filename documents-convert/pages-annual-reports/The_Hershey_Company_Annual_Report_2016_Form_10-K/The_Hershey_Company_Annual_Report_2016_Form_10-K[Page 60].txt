2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations of the businesses
acquired have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective dates of the acquisitions. The
purchase price for each of the acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
2016 Acquisition
Lipple Brand Collective, LLC
On April 26, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Ripple Brand Collective, LLC, a
privately held company based in Congers, New York that owns the barkTHINS mass premium chocolate snacking
brand. The barkTHINS brand is largely sold in the United States in take-home resealable packages and is available in
the club channel, as well as select natural and conventional grocers. Our consolidated net sales for the year ended
December 31, 2016 included approximately $35.6 million attributed to barkTHINS.
The purchase consideration was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values as follows:
] Goodwill $ 128,110 1
Trademarks 9 1,200
’Other intangible assets 60,900 ‘
Other assets, primarily current assets, net of cash acquired totaling $674 12,375
1 Current liabilities (7,211)}
Net assets acquired :$ 285,374 :
Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. The goodwill
resulting from the acquisition is attributable primarily to the value of leveraging our brand building expertise,
consumer insights, supply chain capabilities and retail relationships to accelerate growth and access to barkTHINS
products. Acquired trademarks were assigned estimated useful lives of 27 years, while other intangibles, including
customer relationships and covenants not to compete, were assigned estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 14 years.
The recorded goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
2015 Acquisition
KRAVE Pure Foods
In March 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of KRAVE Pure Foods, Inc. (“Krave”),
the Sonoma, California based manufacturer of Krave, a leading all-natural brand of premium meat snack products.
The transaction was undertaken to allow Hershey to tap into the rapidly growing meat snacks category and further
expand into the broader snacks space.
Total purchase consideration included cash consideration of $220,016, as well as agreement to pay additional cash
consideration of up to $20,000 to the Krave shareholders if certain defined targets related to net sales and gross profit
margin are met or exceeded during the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2015 or March 31, 2016. The fair
value of the contingent cash consideration was classified as a liability of $16,800 as of the acquisition date. Based on
revised targets in a subsequent agreement with the Krave shareholders, the fair value was reduced over the second and
third quarters of 2015 to $10,000, with the adjustment to fair value recorded within selling, marketing and
administrative expenses. The remaining $10,000 was paid in December 2015.
