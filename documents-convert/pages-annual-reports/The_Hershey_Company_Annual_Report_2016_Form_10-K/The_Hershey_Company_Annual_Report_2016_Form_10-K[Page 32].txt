approximately 0.2%. Our 2016 North America performance was similar to the slower growth experienced by other
CPG companies. Additionally, the US. CMG category and manufacturers were impacted by a shorter Easter season
and merchandising and display strategies at select customers. The segment's volume increase was primarily
attributable to new product introductions, partially offset by lower everyday product sales. The unfavorable net price
realization resulted from increased levels of trade promotional spending necessary to support higher levels of in-store
merchandising and display activity. Our Canada operations were impacted by the stronger US. dollar, which drove
the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
Our North America segment income decreased $33.0 million or 1.6% in 2016 compared to 2015, driven by lower
gross margin as higher trade promotional spending and higher supply chain costs were only partially offset by the
benefit from supply chain productivity and cost savings initiatives.
2015 compared with 2014
Net sales of our North America segment increased $115.4 million or 1.8% in 2015 compared to 2014, reﬂecting net
price realization of 4.8% and the favorable net impact of acquisitions and divestitures of 0.3%, substantially oﬁfset by
volume declines of 2.5% and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced net sales by
approximately 0.8%. The volume decline was due to elasticity related to the 2014 pricing action as well as lower
everyday product sales, which were impacted by changing consumer shopping habits, such as channel shifting and e-
commerce, an increase in competitive activity and a proliferation of broader snacking options in the marketplace. Our
Canada operations were impacted by the stronger US. dollar, which drove the unfavorable foreign currency impact.
Our North America segment income increased $157.8 million or 8.2% in 2015 compared to 2014, driven by gross
margin expansion, primarily due to favorable price realization and supply chain productivity, which offset volume
declines and input cost increases.
International and Other
The International and Other segment includes all other countries where we currently manufacture, import, market, sell
or distribute chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery and other products. Currently, this includes our operations in
China and other Asia markets, Latin America, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, along with exports to these regions.
While a less significant component, this segment also includes our global retail operations, including Hershey’s
Chocolate World stores in Hershey, Pennsylvania, New York City, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Niagara Falls (Ontario),
Dubai and Singapore, as well as operations associated with licensing the use of certain trademarks and products to
third parties around the world. International and Other accounted for 12.2%, 12.4% and 14.4% of our net sales in
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. International and Other results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014 were as follows:

2016 compared with 2015
Net sales of our International and Other segment decreased $11.3 million or 1.2% in 2016 compared to 2015,
reﬂecting an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates of 4.4%, volume declines of 3.7% and the
unfavorable impact of net acquisitions and divestitures of 0. 1%, substantially offset by favorable net price realization
of 7.0%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates, the net sales of our International and
Other segment increased by approximately 3.2%.
The favorable net price realization was driven by lower direct trade expense as well as lower returns, discounts and
allowances in China, which declined significantly compared to the prior year. The volume decrease primarily related
to lower sales in India due to the discontinuance of the edible oil business as well as lower sales in our global retail and
licensing business, partially offset by net sales increases in Latin America and select export markets. Constant
