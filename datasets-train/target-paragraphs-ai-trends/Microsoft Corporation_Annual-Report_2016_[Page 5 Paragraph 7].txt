Earlier in this letter I described the transformational opportunities that lie ahead, particularly in the realm of digital
intelligence. We’re growing today’s core businesses and technologies, incubating for the future and investing in long -term
computing breakthroughs. Within our research labs we’re hard at work on advanced machine learning — artificial intelligence
— that will produce forewarnings that can put an end to distracted driving and one day identify a crisis like Zika before it
happens. Quantum computing, theorized for decades by some of the world’s greatest minds as a way to harness the very
building blocks of matter and energy for unimaginable computing capabilities and intelligence, is emerging today as a
feasible technology. Its realization will bring new power to cure disease and address global challenges like climate change.
Our people and partners right now are solving the hard problems of experimental and theoretical physics, mathematics, and
computer science that will accelerate quantum computing’s becoming a reality.
