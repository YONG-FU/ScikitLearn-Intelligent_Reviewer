Note 2 — Net Income (loss) Per Share
Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock
outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and equity incentive
awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock
method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive
common shares.
The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per
share (in millions, except per share amounts):
